this would be a perfect play for al - qaeda if they are attempting to influence the upcoming elections here .

"that notion , in order to eliminate any postal confusion , was <UNK> <UNK> by the united states post office ( page <#> ) . “"

"does it come as any surprise that the "" dial <#> - <UNK> for your favorite <UNK> "" method came up <UNK> short ?"
"oh , that 's right , i should be studying right now ."
"oh yeah , you want to talk racism , sir <UNK> ?"
how is it that <UNK> managed to pay <UNK> to the farmers of the <UNK> valley for lost <UNK> due to lost water .
yet we <UNK> a race of people and to this day they nor their <UNK> have received <UNK> number <#> .
"( english poet <UNK> , <#> - <#> . )"
"as we creep closer and closer to the planned <UNK> of <UNK> control in iraq , the terrorists have turned up the heat to prevent precisely that ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> have become a fact of life in iraq , and for viewers around the globe ."
we 're exposed to the <UNK> details of cold <UNK> murder .
"they have chosen to assist in the cause of freedom , and the end result is that their lives are <UNK> ."
"as we sit here less than <#> hours before the <UNK> of control , the panic is becoming evident in the resistance ."
"they 've stepped up their <UNK> , heated up their rhetoric , and <UNK> their assault on the path to freedom ."
"these <UNK> do n't want freedom precisely because they understand that ultimately , it means that they will lose what power they have to rule through fear and <UNK> ."
"most of us who do n't have first - hand knowledge of what is going on over there , sit in utter <UNK> ."
we wonder why it is that they would be so <UNK> on stopping freedom in it 's tracks .
"we sit here and take these things for granted on a daily basis , and find it difficult to understand why others would be so <UNK> in <UNK> freedom ."
the terrorists who are working overtime trying to prevent freedom from reaching the masses are only serving to accomplish <#> thing .
"they are <UNK> the resolve of those that are determined to see freedom , in whatever form that involves , brought to <UNK> ."
"and , ultimately , the human desire to be free will overcome the desperate tactics of <UNK> determined to prevent that from happening ."
"i look forward to posting my thoughts on just about anything , and getting feedback from you ."
football season has officially arrived as the <UNK> <UNK> took the field for the first time in the 2nd annual <UNK> known as camp del <UNK> .
"we did get a good view of the kicking game , which is probably not the most <UNK> thing to see right now ."
"to start with , let ’s review the injury report ."
"now that we got that out of the way , let ’s get right to what happened today at camp !"
"first off , it rained an hour before practice started , and it rained hard ."
"so , there was a nice cool breeze at the beginning of practice , and the weather wasn’t too hot for the boys ."
"they practiced this morning in shirts , shorts , and <UNK> ."
pads will become part of the <UNK> later this week .
"a good crowd turned out for the first session , although it wasn’t quite as big as the same session last year ."
"still , the fan support is there , and they seem quite excited about the prospects for the <#> <UNK> ."
"notes : first , some impressions based on the first look at the <#> <UNK> ."
david <UNK> is looking healthy and sharp most of the time .
it doesn’t appear that he ’s suffering any ill effects from his <UNK> <UNK> earlier this year .
"he ’s looking to be back up to weight , and not <UNK> at all ."
his passes are the most accurate among the entire <UNK> crew at this point .
doug johnson clearly has the <UNK> arm among the <#> <UNK> competing .
"but , he has nice touch on his passes ."
"first round draft pick , and newly <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> williams is a big , solid looking <UNK> ."
"he ’s not a world - class burner , but his physical presence is going to be a major <UNK> for the team ."
the same thing can be said for <UNK> <UNK> .
the <#> clearly stand out when the <UNK> ’s are <UNK> together .
anthony <UNK> is going to be an interesting prospect to watch .
"he looked good in individual <UNK> , but really <UNK> in team <UNK> later in practice ."
"<UNK> t , toe , david allen , and greg jones looked good in practice today ."
"fred and toe looked extremely sharp in their running , but it ’s day <#> , and <UNK> aren’t really <UNK> , so it ’s easy to look good ."
"<UNK> douglas looks trim , and was looking pretty quick in the first <UNK> of camp ."
i’ll reserve comment on whether he ’s really back or not until we see him in pads in the heat of the day later in camp .
"for now , suffice to say that he looks good ."
"tony <UNK> also looks to be in good shape , although i did have some concern about seeing him walking with a slight limp ."
<UNK> ’s <UNK> ’s passes were really sharp in the <#> on <#> drill .
he was hitting everything and doing it with significant zip .
<UNK> also displayed some nice <UNK> on his passes .
chris <UNK> - <UNK> might want to take some extra <UNK> on pass <UNK> .
"in the first of many drops during the day , he <UNK> <#> passes perfectly placed in crossing <UNK> ."
"greg jones showed some really nice hands in the same patterns , making a couple of really athletic grabs on less than accurately delivered passes from <UNK> gray ."
to say that <UNK> gray was struggling with his short passes would be an <UNK> .
the passes that were caught were usually circus grabs inside of <#> yards as gray continues to have trouble pulling the string on throws right in front of him .
"fred <UNK> made a really nice hook move to shake his coverage , making a nice grab on a pass from <UNK> ."
"as if the <UNK> had been thrown down , <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> the hook move to perfection to make a nice catch ."
<UNK> ’s todd <UNK> made a really nice catch on an out route from <UNK> to start the <UNK> .
"he ’s pretty quick for a big guy , and shows some nice hands ."
"he ’s going to have our te ’s working to keep their jobs , especially <UNK> , and <UNK> , who did nothing <UNK> during practice session # <#> ."
"doug johnson struggled to hit his mark early on , consistently coming up short in passing balls inside <#> yards ."
allen <UNK> made a really nice <UNK> grab on a pass over the middle for about an <UNK> gain on <#> of johnson ’s less <UNK> balls .
troy edwards also made a really nice diving catch on another <UNK> pass from <UNK> gray .
"greg jones showed some really nice hands in a grab over the middle on a low pass from gray , never breaking <UNK> as he caught the ball ."
"<UNK> ’s david <UNK> <UNK> himself very quickly in these <UNK> , and kyle <UNK> looked like a pro bowl te in the process ."
"<UNK> threw a bullet over the middle about <#> yards <UNK> to <UNK> , who <UNK> the pass in and blew through the secondary <UNK> ."
"this was only <#> of many nice grabs <UNK> made on the day , so the ladies should be happy ."
"i mentioned anthony <UNK> earlier in the article , and this is why ."
could be a guy who provides some solid depth for the team .
"i’ll be watching him to see if this is the norm , or if he just got lucky . once again"
", greg jones displayed good hands in a dump pass from doug johnson that forced jones to make an awkward catch ."
he did it without missing a step over the middle .
"the guy is a <UNK> to look at , and he ’s got good hands ."
he could be <#> of the <UNK> of this draft class .
"<UNK> gray missed low , wide , and behind on a regular basis ."
"this is the way he started camp last year , so we’ll see if he <UNK> in the same manner that he did last year ."
"<UNK> ’s jimmy smith struggled in these <UNK> , missing not <#> , but <#> very <UNK> balls , including <#> that <UNK> right off the numbers ."
"the old boy looked sharp other than those <#> instances , but he needs to be careful with a stable full of young horses <UNK> for his job ."
<UNK> <UNK> also had a dropped pass on a very <UNK> ball from <UNK> on a deep out pattern .
it certainly didn’t <UNK> from the other great grabs he made earlier in the day .
"unfortunately , he had another drop on a very <UNK> short pass over the middle from doug johnson ."
"in a position where competition is fierce , dropping balls like that don’t help to cement your position on the <UNK> ."
he did however <UNK> himself with a really nice deep toss to <UNK> <UNK> a couple of plays later .
greg jones had his <#> <UNK> of the first practice when he missed a short pass over the middle from <UNK> that hit him in the numbers .
todd <UNK> also <UNK> a very <UNK> ball from <UNK> .
doug johnson displayed his lack of big arm strength by under throwing a deep pass to <UNK> <UNK> by <#> yards .
it was so short that even the corner covering the play couldn’t get back to the ball .
this had to be the play of the day because of the <UNK> he displayed .
"the <UNK> i wish i could say that i saved the best for last , but why lie ?"
the kicking game is going to be something that we will have to watch very closely .
none of the guys appears to be the lock for the starting gig at this point .
"<UNK> has a big leg , but that whole kicking it straight thing can be a real <UNK> for him . the same thing with last year"
"chris <UNK> showed the most <UNK> , but don’t <UNK> that comment ."
"hopefully it ’s just the first day of camp , and things will get <UNK> better as time goes by . the bright moment in the kicking game ?"
"he ’s got amazing air under his <UNK> , and they are turning over like he ’s in mid - season form ."
"he ’s showing no ill effects from his <UNK> incident last year , so our <UNK> game is of no concern ."
joey z looked good back there at long <UNK> .
"however , they looked to be a quicker group than in years past ."
"this was <UNK> particularly when seeing the secondary moving toward the ball , and the <UNK> that they showed ."
"they were also very aggressive in the middle of the field , forcing the offense to earn their keep ."
the offense is <UNK> struggling at this point .
it 's not the first time she 's had a <UNK> in judgment .
"in <#> , the house ethics committee reported that she used poor judgment when she accepted gifts from an african <UNK> ."
he had provided <UNK> for brown in his luxury miami <UNK> .
his chief financial officer gave brown 's daughter a $ <#> <UNK> <UNK> .
"so , it should come as no surprise that she would <UNK> on <#> votes that she feels were <UNK> thrown out in the <#> election ."
nor is it a surprise that she would conveniently ignore the fact that thousands of military <UNK> were tossed out after a <UNK> court battle by the gore campaign .
why would she want to consider those votes when they most likely were going to go heavily toward the governor of texas ?
"by some accounts , thousands of votes went <UNK> because of that mix - up ."
"house of representatives , the state of florida , the city of <UNK> and the district she represents ."
"special team ’s practice is hardly exciting , and difficult to report on because most of the action is <UNK> ."
"but , nonetheless , it ’s football , so it ’s better than nothing , right ?"
suffice to say that none of the players that had been reported to be <UNK> at some point yesterday appeared to be suffering any lingering effects from practice yesterday .
the defensive unit was out there stretching and doing some <UNK> .
"this gave the fans a good opportunity to watch tony <UNK> , paul <UNK> , and john <UNK> do their <UNK> before heading back to the locker room ."
"<UNK> was out there briefly as well , and didn’t appear to be dealing with any pain issues that were obvious ."
"bobby <UNK> was also out there getting in some <UNK> , and having a good time chatting it up with some fans ."
"naturally , the <UNK> gear was getting plenty of <UNK> time as he made his way down the fence line ."
<UNK> is a little guy compared to the other <#> .
"<UNK> looked terrific out there , showing good hands and great <UNK> in the drill they were working on ."
"now , let ’s get right to the <UNK> ."
<UNK> returns / coverage : chris <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> consistently and with mid - season <UNK> .
"again , he ’s clearly back to his old form , and ready for the season to begin ."
"of special note is the fact that his wife and their baby were in attendance , and the boy is absolutely adorable ."
"david allen had the best day of the bunch , avoiding the dreaded <UNK> that bit the other guys , lewis with the most <UNK> ."
"obviously , he ’s got some <UNK> to deal with ."
there was <#> special note regarding the long - <UNK> situation .
<#> guys worked in <UNK> at the position during practice today .
"obviously , the ever - present joey z was in with the # <#> ’s , while mike <UNK> worked with the # <#> ’s ."
"the # <#> long <UNK> was none other than double d , <UNK> <UNK> ."
he actually did a decent job at the position with some pretty crisp <UNK> right on target .
"i know that he had done this in college , and has worked in this <UNK> in the past during camp ."
it ’s good to see him willing to do some work with the special teams to help upgrade their situation .
greg <UNK> also participated in some of these <UNK> as well .
"other than the little bit reported above , there wasn’t a whole lot to monitor at the practice ."
"anyone who ’s been to a special teams practice knows that the vast majority of the time , they’re working on <UNK> the players , and nothing more ."
no field goal work was done at all today .
"my guess is that <UNK> be letting the <UNK> do their thing at the night practice , which i’ll be at ."
"first , the electrical system in my work car went out"
and i had to drive home without turn signals or brake lights .
"i drove slowly , carefully and with an eagle eye for cops even though my car is a marked government car ."
"now , just a speeding ticket is <#> thing , but i am <#> days into a <#> days suspended license due to driving w/o insurance <#> years ago ."
"i was involved in an accident that was n't my fault , but nonetheless , poor and stupid i did n't have insurance ."
it took the state <#> years to catch up with me .
"my lawyer says my "" problem "" is that i am too honest ) ."
"and , he post dated the ticket so to give me more time to pay it ."
"i am not getting off to a very <UNK> start here , though , and now i am very scared to venture forth with the <UNK> ."
"i have <#> years of crap stuffed down in the basement , <UNK> , <UNK> , my head and anywhere else i can <UNK> it ."
i worked yesterday on the basement and found a bunch of books i had forgotten long ago .
"i realized i have n't read anything non - textbook oriented in a long , long time ."
"could n't get enough written material : magazines , novels , short fiction , non - fiction ... currently i am obsessed with blogs ."
"in particular , i spend many minutes reading the archives of <UNK> since i have only recently discovered lisa 's life from a link on path to freedom site ."
"i swear we have been living parallel lives : <UNK> dresses and doc <UNK> , <UNK> , wrong men and finding <#> that is right"
", children , <UNK> , wishing for <#> acres ... because of her writing i have been <UNK> music loves of my past ."
all of this thinking about my own past has made me realize that i have <UNK> to a different place in my life .
"all of the striving and personal pressure to be an "" original person "" has <UNK> me into an <UNK> rock of ideas and interests and dreams ."
as a kid i wanted to live on a farm .
as a teenager and young adult ( college years ) i wanted to be an <UNK> .
"i lived in san <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> and loved the city ."
somewhere around <#> i started <UNK> for a simple life .
... and back to all this crap i have maintained .
<UNK> and i are moving ahead and discovering that our dreams just may be realized .
"it 's not much area , but <#> times more land space than we have now ."
the yard is <UNK> and neglected - i'm sure a couple of <UNK> <UNK> would do the trick .
"i am holding my breath until we are <UNK> the door , though ..."
i see myself <UNK> and <UNK> and raising my <UNK> and living lightly on our tired earth .
"i see jr running around , exploring nature and growing into a secure and <UNK> person ."
"there , i hope i can <UNK> my <UNK> bones and stretch ..."
this evening is cast in yellow and a strange <UNK> is settling in around me .
it has been rainy most of the day and it seems that at this end of july autumn has already arrived .
i <UNK> my tomatoes and cherry and peach jam in the last few days and i feel quite satisfied with the results .
i can <UNK> my son and partner and self with food developed from a known source .
"these <UNK> foods are an extension of the effort i spent watering , <UNK> and <UNK> a small jungle of plants ."
i told my friend d that i felt she and i were of a generation skipped over our parents .
"we are <UNK> of depression era grandparents who <UNK> and <UNK> ( or <UNK> ) , <UNK> , saved , and "" made - do "" ."
"our parents were taught these skills but became adults in an society that provides everything it needs cheap and mass produced , made to be thrown away ."
"for that , the convenience of not doing yourself has been a stronger drive and the necessity of skills for "" doing for <#> 's own self"
""" have been forgotten and were not passed on to our generation ."
"so we feel "" cheated "" at not having learned these vital skills ."
"and , with the <UNK> economy and government and <UNK> values we are learning that we need these skills that saved our depression era grandparents ."
we feel compelled to learn these self - <UNK> skills - basic <UNK> lessons .
we seek to be volunteers in simplicity and self - <UNK> .
we feel the drive to care and <UNK> our families and our selves .
so we master self - teaching and learn the basics which are not so basic to someone who has never experienced the basics .
""" they "" have decided that my husband 's <UNK> official last day with his unit will be next monday ( <UNK> ) ."
they screwed him out of being <UNK> and have only had him on <UNK> status ...
"screwed him out of going to war ... due to "" policy "" ... and have interrupted his civilian life for basically nothing ."
my website has been posted on <UNK> john <UNK> 's website ...
any <UNK> which committee <UNK> <UNK> works for ? ?
he 's a member of the house armed services committee ... a retired marine <UNK> ...
was the pilot of marine <#> under president ronald w. reagan and loves marines ...
my husband leaves tonight for an <UNK> amount of time ...
could be a day ... could be a week ... ? ?
does n't anybody care that my husband has a family ?
does n't anybody care that they 're <UNK> <UNK> on my nerves ...
"i think i only have <#> left ... and "" they 're "" wearing it awfully thin ."
i 'm a reasonable person ... but really .
"how much do "" they "" expect <#> <UNK> wife and mom to endure ?"
is this some strange sort of chinese torture ?
is this a test of my good nature ?
"are "" they "" simply pushing to see at what point i 'll push back ?"
""" they "" know who "" they "" are ... and more importantly i know who "" they "" are !"
so my husband 's home ... a place he has n't been in <#> days .
his unit is <UNK> up for <UNK> to that sand box in the east .
my husband wants to <UNK> ... to say he 's desperate would be an <UNK> .
he 'll have to stay home with me and the little <#> .
did he pop positive on a piss test ?
"mind you ... said "" policy "" has been extended for others ... just not my husband ."
ca n't find <#> person who is able to break it down <UNK> style so even a <UNK> little wife like me can understand .
"why during a time of war would they even contemplate <UNK> a <UNK> marine who is ready , willing , and able ?"
who knows ! so ... if any of you have the answer
just be sure to explain it like i 'm a <#> year old ...
so i understand ' cause this shit do n't make no sense to me .
"so for the past couple of years i have been using a <#> "" <UNK> <UNK> for surfing the web , ripping music for my ipod ."
"the <UNK> was great for some of this , and good for other parts ."
"being a windows guy , who <UNK> the mac , and loves the industrial design apple <UNK> with their products"
"i have had a hard time finding a replacement for my "" <UNK> "" machine ."
"so i guess the future is looking good for finding a replacement , and this is certainly close ."
"<UNK> had the opportunity to show her photos again , this time in kent at a small restaurant ."
"she had a great display and attracted a reasonable amount of interest for a friday night , in a quiet little town ."
"the thing that surprised me about kent , was actually how cool the downtown area seemed to be ."
"i have been to kent a few times ( mostly to drop off <UNK> 's grandma ) , but have never seen this side of it ."
"wandering around , it reminded me of la <UNK> which <UNK> and i visited spent the day in last summer ."
"so having put off being a part of the hip blog crowd , i have finally decided to create <#> ."
"its more procrastination than anything else that stopped me from having a blog in the past , so lets see how i do at keeping this up to date ."
"my husband , little boy and myself go out to eat at a local pizza buffet once a week ."
but i ca n't help but get <UNK> everytime we go .
"my husband and son only like thin <UNK> <UNK> and obviously so does everyone else , because it is the first item on the buffet that goes ."
so when we come in and order our drinks we always special order a thin <UNK> <UNK> for the buffet .
as soon as they put it out there ... we make such a <UNK> of ourselves trying to be the first ones in line .
"the person in front of you is <UNK> up not <#> , not <#> , but <#> slices ..."
... save some for the rest of us !
but when its my turn i gather up enough slices for my husband and my son ... and i can only imagine what the person behind me is saying !
why do these pizza restaurants do this to <UNK> cheese and <UNK> are the choice picks so why do n't they make more ?
"they put out vegetarian , ranch , taco , <UNK> are <UNK> most of the time if you get up to go for your second helping ..."
thats what you have to choose from ... because the <UNK> and cheese are already <UNK> .
its like the manager and the staff are silently having their fun with us as we <UNK> around for the best slices .
"well , the next time you go to a buffet ... see for yourself ."
out comes a fresh <UNK> or cheese pizza and watch and see if people do n't practically elbow each other trying to be the first in line .
it 's monday morning and i 'm glad .
i love the start of a new week .
it gives me the feeling somewhat of a new beginning ...
especially when its a beautiful sunny day like today .
we built my little boy a swing set .
i finished up my last show yesterday afternoon .
"i sang "" i enjoy being a girl "" from the "" flower drum "" ."
"they are thinking about doing "" grease "" in the spring ."
i must confess i lost my temper with my little boy last night .
we came in from shopping and i told him to go put his dirty clothes in the <UNK> and get in the <UNK> .
when he did .... he <UNK> all over the carpet and some of my clothes that i had just washed .
i lost it and said some very nasty things to him .
"and i said the "" f "" word more times than i care to think about ."
he ca n't talk but he can communicate a little bit with <UNK> ...
i 'm happy today and in a few minutes i 'm gonna take him outside to his new swing set .
ok .... this is my second post ... starting to get kind of bold ... : )
"if you read this , let me hear from you so i 'll know if any body is actually reading this ."
let me tell you a little about me .
i 'm a <UNK> and i am a singer and an actress in my local theater .
"hence the name , <UNK> , who 's character i <UNK> this last spring in our production of "" south pacific "" ."
"if anyone is familiar with this beloved broadway musical , talk to <UNK> me know what you think about it ... or anything else that comes to mind ."
this is my first post for my new blog .
"i 'm really looking forward to sharing my ideas , frustrations and thoughts with people all over the world and making new friends who share the same interests ."
", i know what you 're going to say , they 're nasty ....."
"personally , i do n't prefer to <UNK> <UNK> above the toilet while i try to relieve myself ."
"it 's highly uncomfortable and makes a huge mess , which brings me to the point i 'm trying to make ."
i 'm sick and tired of having to clean up your pee pee of the <UNK> just because you have some obsessive compulsive disorder .
"if you must <UNK> over the toilet , at least be <UNK> and wipe off your excess so i do n't have to do it ."
"as if we did n't have enough action yesterday with the gas issue , today brought another line of traffic passing through <UNK> ."
"right up to <#> tonight , there was still traffic coming out of town and still a small crowd gathered discussing all kind of things about the crash ."
all of a sudden we have <#> experts on plane crashes and how <UNK> happened and who was to blame and how they could move the plane and ..........
with all this action going on i wonder what tomorrow would bring ?
"well in a big country that s probably the case but here in <UNK> , things are not that <UNK> ."
you have to remember that we do n't have any oil <UNK> that we can pump so we have to import it .
every week you 'll see <#> of <UNK> ships in port pumping gas into numerous storage tanks .
well it so happened today that <#> of the <UNK> went to the gas station in <UNK> and off loaded its content .
the station opened back up and cars and buses started to fill up .
the problem was that someone made a mistake and put <UNK> into the regular gas storage so the station was pumping the wrong type .
the shell station had to close and everyone ended up going to <UNK> for gas causing a huge line .
"the thing is , they were now running out of gas causing a general <UNK> ."
"ok , ok , i missed a day but what do you expect living on an island ."
"nobody 's rushed here you know , think people do things on time ?"
st vincent finally got its act together earlier this year and my company followed suit back in may .
"remember , deadline is right upon us and we only just taking action ."
"well , the more we read the details , the more work we had to do and the more money we had to spend ."
"so as <#> deadline approaches another <#> passes and that s for our disaster <UNK> . in case you forgot , hurricane season started 1st june"
and we 're supposed to make sure everything is in place just in case a storm passes by ......
i 'm just sitting here thinking about how good god is to me .
<#> that cares about every tiny detail in my life .
all the times i 've made decisions based on my own selfish desires ...
all the times i 've walked away from him ...
all the times i 've neglected my relationship with him ...
"it 's all in the past , and despite all that i 've done , he wants to have a relationship with me ."
"i never really give that enough thought , honestly ."
the god of the universe ... maker of all that we see and all that we do n't see ...
"the <#> whose spoken words formed it all ... he who <UNK> time , space , and everything else we do n't know about"
"not only did he do all that , he did it because my own sins required it ."
no <#> shows greater love than when he <UNK> down his life for his friends .
you are my friends if you do what i command you .
"i do not call you <UNK> anymore , because a servant does not know what his master is doing ."
"but i have called you friends , because i have made known to you everything that i have heard from my father ."
"you have not chosen me , but i have chosen you ."
"( john <UNK> - <#> <UNK> ) thank you jesus , for calling me friend !"
urllink <UNK> <#> of the best christian discussion and web - <UNK> sites on the net .
"run by my friend nate ( <UNK> ) , and dedicated to the lifting up the name of jesus , and <UNK> his people ."
i just like to tell you a little about this group i started .
this yahoo group was made so <UNK> like i can sell there <UNK> on line for no cost .
i believe on line sales will <UNK> both <UNK> and <UNK> .
so <UNK> join this yahoo group to buy or to sell your <UNK> craft from <UNK> real live <UNK> .
i 'm still tired from yesterday 's yard work marathon prior to dinner last night .
i wake up hungry at <#> am and ca n't get back to sleep .
"i bit the hell out of my mouth , accidentally of course , during lunch ."
and i had to deal with all the little issues this morning with the cry baby in the uk .
"geez , i just want a beer , a fan , and something good to watch ."
"<UNK> should be here soon , so i will be able to go home soon ."
"so , i 've done my bit of complaining ... thanks for reading , because i 'm sure it is really boring ."
as there was a <#> hour time delay since the first <#> paragraphs ....
i'm feeling better about life now that i 've eaten and a couple beers down the <UNK> .
i 'm looking forward to getting the <#> day weekend going on .
i know i 'm enjoying the last days before we go back on the diet .
"god , i remember when i use to enjoy these food and not feel ill ."
"now , i 'm on the search for a home gym and free weights ... so that means i 'm going to get into shape ? ?"
at least i still have my beer and wine ... for <#> more days .
"i really suck at it , do n't i ?"
do n't worry .... it always can get worse .
"i 'm trying to not to let it get to me , but it 's hard sometimes ."
"first , <#> of my servers crashes at <UNK> this morning ."
"third , the it director is taking <UNK> ( or however you spell it ) for a back injury and he 's on the <UNK> of the mentally challenged ."
all i want to do is learn out to install my new blade servers .
"anyway , i 'm getting over this whole work thing now ."
i should be out ther <UNK> my lawn like my neighbor but i really do n't like doing that sort of thing at this time of night .
and i 'm going to stay here until bed time .
i am so sore from doing that yoga yesterday and i only did <#> minutes of it .
... imagine what would happen if i did the usual <#> hours in the class i was taking before i moved .
i need to go and call my dad before i forget .
the wine is kicking in and it 's not long before bed .
"now if the neighbor can pour some speed on his little legs , the lawn <UNK> may be done before now ."
same bat channel ... who knows about the time tomorrow .
is n't it funny how you get what you wished for and it 's not what you want ?
i wanted a nice quiet weekend and that is what i got .
"however , i got very restless and had to go do "" things "" ."
"hmmm , go to ikea and get a new computer desk , go to sam 's club and get a <UNK> table and haul all this stuff home ."
"we also did the grocery shopping , laundry and took in a nature walk at the local <UNK> ."
today i just had to put together the new desk before <UNK> and then just tore up some cardboard sitting in the garage .
i do n't seem to get how to relax .
i have these new servers just waiting for me to install them ...
i 've been working towards getting my company to an enterprise level of server architecture and it 's hard to convince management to part with their money .
but i am <#> step closer with these new blade servers i had them get .
now if they would only finish up the order so i can complete the windows <#> active directory upgrade .
i warned you that i was a geek .
"<UNK> so , today is my mom 's birthday and i lost her phone number ."
she does n't really seem to want to celebrate it so i just sent a card because that is what she said she wanted .
"but right when i was going to look for the number , she called me ."
not about the birthday mind you but about the diet both <UNK> and myself had been on .
we lost <UNK> a piece on the south beach diet .
"i would recommend that diet because of the focused on low fat , <UNK> <UNK> and veggies ."
"the low carb thing is rough on your ability to be regular , but it works on the weight loss ."
"so , we talked about that for a while ."
the relationship between my mother and myself goes like a roller coaster .
there are definitely ups and downs ... and fast curves .
i do n't believe that mom is very stable in the head but it took lots of therapy for me to realize how much i am like my mom .
"i do n't like that too much , but i 'm working on it ."
i 'm finding that this is a nice venue for my thoughts and ramblings .
"maybe i 'll get a reaction , maybe not ."
"as long as i 'm being true to me , that is all that matters ."
"my partner , <UNK> , and i have been together for <#> and half years ."
we really did n't date because she said she did n't want too ...
so i had her move in within a month of meeting her in person .
we actually met after i moved to the seattle area through her ex - girlfriend .
"i posted a personal ad to find a "" activity partner "" not a "" relationship partner "" and her ex answered it ."
there 's is n't a large out culture in <UNK> ... to say the least .
"anyway , back the story .... <UNK> 's ex - girlfriend ( who she was still living with ) answered and we started <UNK> ."
she gave me her home phone number and i called during the day and got <UNK> .
"each time i called , <UNK> was home and her ex was n't ."
"after the second time , she asked me if i realized that her ex was at work ..."
i said of course and that i wanted to talk to her .
she has the most wonderful voice and really knows how to use it .
"we read the same books , like many of the same things and connected on a very deep level ."
i was falling for her over the phone .
we met in person with her ex and <#> of my old friends at <UNK> .
we clicked in person as we did over the phone .
"within a month , i was able to find a job in <UNK> and an apartment ."
we moved in together and have been growing strong since .
"she is my best friend , a wonderful lover and the center of my world ."
"as for kids , the only children we have is our <#> cats , peanut and <UNK> ."
peanut was originally <UNK> 's but has become my cat when we all moved in together .
<UNK> is the youngest that joined our family after my cat <UNK> died .
"<UNK> likes my lap , but she <UNK> <UNK> ."
"so , that 's us in a <UNK> ."
i wo n't go into the drama of my family yet .
that will take another long entry that can only be confusing and cause many comments .
welcome to my site ... this is the first time i 'm doing this .
"now , my profile and description of the site is like a preview to the main event ."
", there may be a few <UNK> in my posting , but i will be faithful in my checking the email and the site ."
"recent happenings is my partner , <UNK> , and myself bought our first house ... woo hoo !"
and we have been learning about the joys and <UNK> of <UNK> a house .
"a latter , hose , lawn <UNK> ... weed <UNK> .... and the list goes on ."
feedback is always welcome but flames will be ignored .
enjoy ... i'm looking forward to hearing from you guys .
i 'm so looking forward to getting out of here and relaxing ... or attempt to relax for <#> days .
"if the weather holds out , might even work on that tan that i do n't have yet ."
<UNK> always says that i 'm the <UNK> white woman that she knows and usually <UNK> me around with sun block .
it really sucks because <UNK> is half indian and <UNK> when she 's hit with a reflection .
but i usually do n't do the tanning bit because my family has a history of skin cancer if exposed to it too much .
"besides , i just want my legs not to look like white sausage any more ."
everything is a <UNK> except the movies and usually they are re - makes .
"and the online game we play , <UNK> 's call <#> , is <UNK> <UNK> right now ."
"loosely seated in the bush and <UNK> of african <UNK> , the show <UNK> a local pride of <UNK> , their daily <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> affairs ."
towards the final minutes of the program a new <UNK> was introduced .
"tears <UNK> up in ethan ’s eyes as she was attacked , <UNK> and run out of the familiar circle of cats ."
she had never seen him cry as he did when he watched her .
the <UNK> had once again appeared and she felt this time it would not simply go away .
sara could not understand why he had to go and had <UNK> herself that there were parts of him she would never truly know .
"they had been together almost <#> years and the dark , secret lonely side of him appeared , again , as an <UNK> she could never seem to see ."
"ethan had never been to africa , he never expressed any sort of interest in the <UNK> or any kind of desire to go there ."
she would never forget the moment the <UNK> appeared to him .
"this time she was witness to his heart , the <UNK> and that <UNK> within him ."
"haunting him , keeping him from the warm light of her love and the possibility of their life together , the <UNK> took him once again ."
it was as if he could solve her problem he would solve his own .
the trouble with these thoughts was he didn’t even know what his problem was .
the symptoms had become <UNK> obvious over the last few years but the problem had remained hidden .
"<UNK> from him yet present in everything , everyone and anything he remotely tried to use to forget it ."
"<UNK> a tortured heavy need , somewhere , far off , away from himself , ethan began his search for the <UNK> ."
"leaving sara , without any real reason why , the <UNK> of guilt began envelope him as he waited for his luggage ."
they were researching the deaths of a large percentage of the african <UNK> .
most dies from a form of <UNK> <UNK> which has spread to most of the <UNK> on the plain .
ethan heard of the group ’s mission through a friend at the university of washington .
seth had traveled to <UNK> the previous year on a personal trip and learned of the lion ’s <UNK> through his guide .
it was only by chance that the topic of the <UNK> ever came up between ethan and seth .
“ what the heck are you doing her old boy ”
slapping ethan on the back as he studied at the <UNK> ’s natural sciences library .
"“ not much on these walls for a number <UNK> like you , huh . ” “"
"hey , how in the hell did they let you in here ."
i thought they would have <UNK> you to the gate after graduation you fat bastard .
” seth wasn’t fat but the <UNK> was from a film they both held near and dear to them .
anytime they met on campus it used to be a race to see who could slide it into conversation first .
seth and ethan were in the same class but being <#> different <UNK> they weren’t too close anymore .
"freshman year they lived down the hall from <#> another in <UNK> hall , a dorm on campus ."
partying was the major of choice for most of the freshman <UNK> and ethan and seth were no exception .
"seeing him there in the library , <#> years after graduation that bright spring day was no less than an outright shock ."
"back home , the truth is revealed and <UNK> is alive and well reading his letters seemed to keep ethan closer ."
"the smell of his hands , skin scent upon <UNK> , traveled pages keep her warm these last few <UNK> weeks ."
"friends came and went . passing the time with dinners , gossip , wine , big bowls of <UNK> salty popcorn and bad rented movies ."
"“ i can’t understand why you don’t just send those <UNK> letters back , throw his shit in a storage locker and move on ” ."
"tears <UNK> up in her eyes now , not wanting to fight but still not ready to let go “ because i love him dammit !"
isn’t that the way it ’s supposed to <UNK> mean isn’t that enough ” .
“ it should be enough sara but it isn’t that simple with him .
do you honestly think you can trust him again ?
"and there it was , she had gone there and it was done ."
"rebecca slowly picked up the living room , placed the movie back in its plastic box kissed sara on the cheek and left ."
"it was thursday . as she put the last of his over read , <UNK> letters away in the <UNK> yellow <UNK> box under the couch"
"digging <#> of their <#> <UNK> out of <UNK> , <UNK> pillows and <UNK> , sara found the tv ’s remote and quickly turned the show off ."
she didn’t feel like watching what it was that sent her love away from her .
"ethan had wandered before , the show was a reminder that he had left , again ."
the <#> had been together a little under a year when she realized ethan ’s heart had serious reservations about where their relationship was headed .
they weren’t living together at this point but it had been discussed .
<#> winter sunday afternoon ethan suggested they see a movie and get some dinner afterwards .
"nothing unusual , he liked to be out among people , moving feeling others around him , moving ."
"there is this film downtown i heard was really good , what do you think ? ”"
"after some quick <UNK> of <UNK> , a couple of <UNK> through the hair and the usual seattle sweater and <UNK> jacket sara met him at the door ."
"a few small comments on the weather , his latest work project and a few questions on her newest <UNK> ."
"it was <#> of the things she loved about him , his sense of duty ."
"that personal responsibility most men she knew seemed so casual with , as if keeping your word were the equivalent of a mood swing ."
"switching careers , relationships , homes , cars you name it as if it was some sort of sport ."
"racing to get to some level , at the expense of their word , these men would sacrifice that part of a man that makes him a man ."
"<UNK> out the rainy window into the usual dark , cold seattle night sara began to feel a slow , <UNK> <UNK> building in her stomach ."
“ here we are ” he <UNK> as he opened her door and shut it behind her .
"enjoyable , funny with the usual <#> <UNK> scenes , the film fulfilled her annual <UNK> - <UNK> - girl - film fix for the year ."
as they stood to wait for their row to exit she suddenly knew where the <UNK> came from and who it belonged to .
"ethan spotted her first , <UNK> the hair raising chill <UNK> down his spine , sara glanced the direction he was looking ."
meeting the gaze of a woman she had never met and never planned on wanting to .
"quickly , hoping sara hadn’t noticed , he sat back down pulling her into the seat next to him ."
"lets just sit and wait for everyone to leave , maybe we can sneak into the next showing . ”"
forcing a <UNK> hoping his stunned knee jerk reaction wasn’t too obvious .
“ i just want to know if that was her ” .
she really didn’t want to know but before the words could take the air from her lungs and pass from her lips to him she knew .
the ding - <UNK> <UNK> of the pizza guy snapped her out of the <UNK> memory and she left the couch and <UNK> to get dinner .
"there , on the sofa , alone sara ate <#> piece of bad delivery cardboard pizza , then <#> ."
"she never could make it past <#> pieces , even if ethan was there to <UNK> her on ."
shifting for a more comfortable spot and pulling the tv <UNK> from the small of her back she <UNK> hit the power switch .
"sara saw the <UNK> as he had , needing a savior and not realizing it . calling out to the night , not knowing why but <UNK>"
"somewhere deep within her , in that place which is both transparent and <UNK> , she needed ."
sara watched the last few moments of the program fearing what her gut had told her so many times before .
"in nature , as in life , animals lose and die and it ’s cruel ."
<UNK> would die that night on the <UNK> and the love of sara ’s life would be lost to her forever .
"ethan would never be able to save her , to save himself ."
"he would never look into her eyes , <UNK> himself in her and in doing so , save them both ."
the wrong pride ethan and the group continue looking for <UNK> .
"some days slipped by like <UNK> thoughts on an empty bus , going nowhere with no <#> to share the emptiness ."
"others reminded her of those naked , high school , can't - remember - the - last - day - i - went - to - class dreams ."
"daily finding herself frightened , vulnerable and alive despite the overwhelming craving to crawl in a dark hole and keep in the warm ."
each night as her head hit those lonely pillows she begged for the next sunrise to be <UNK> than the last .
"the problem was that each sunrise was <UNK> than the last , she just could n't see it ."
"there were <#> things , factors , in her life by which she <UNK> each day ."
"generally the <#> with the worst outlook of the day was deemed to be the most important , at least for that day ."
"if she was lucky chloe would get out of the house by 7:30 , her parents house that is , and that was without a shower or coffee ."
"in this cold twilight as we sit in silence , never to learn all there is ."
"sitting here eve of eve , never knowing all there is to know ."
"does butter live in heaven or hell . and while we are talking death , where does diet coke live ."
i only say these things because wherever these <#> small <UNK> sins live is where i want to go .
"this came up as i sat in front of a saturday night fire , a few candles with stir - fry out of a bag and some rice ."
"everything is better with butter so back to the kitchen , next to the <UNK> , in the little dish with a cow on it ."
as a kid i was deprived of the good food .
"i came home from school every day , took the spare house key from the mailbox and sat down to the current episode of star <UNK> ."
at 3:30 monday thru friday i had to call down the federal building to let her know i was home .
it was on this call i received the instructions for dinner du <UNK> .
"“ take out the pork <UNK> , fill the sink with hot water and leave them in it till i get home , and do your homework ” ."
"at least we only had pork chop once a week , but they were horrible ."
"i never asked to be <UNK> on <UNK> night or spaghetti night , only the eve of pork and bone ."
is my time and place hiding in the pocket <UNK> of somebody else ’s <UNK> or pocket .
"when i wake up tomorrow will those things , which were supposed to happen to me , be happening to someone else ."
"<UNK> away the limp , curled edges of the onion to get to the bitter fruit inside ."
"if everything i have done , seen , eaten , fucked and left was supposed to happen , supposed to lead me here , when does it end ?"
"when do you get to that place in your life where you stop in the middle of the sidewalk and say , this is it , i’m here ."
"all the places , and seconds , and faces and ice cream <UNK> added up spit out this sum ."
"despite all you were trained to believe , throughout your <UNK> little childhood , you are not the asshole at the end of my rainbow ."
"in those shared <UNK> showers , at football camp and the <UNK> of <UNK> and boy <UNK> , they lied to you ."
"woman , for not listening to our guts when they screamed at us over <#> dollar dinners and hollow conversation ."
most of you aren’t even in the right forest !
"most of the time i <UNK> my life is full , satisfying and mostly complete ."
by the time i have convinced that i 'm actually ok with the status of my <UNK> existence it becomes <UNK> apparent my life is boring .
not even vanilla bean with those curious little black dots we all want to believe are vanilla spots .
"no , my existence in this <UNK> <UNK> of seattle is almost <UNK> painful ."
so do i choose to do anything about it ?
"for my first blog , i thought i 'd do a quick thought i have about <UNK> ."
it 's a simple philosophy : kids are like <UNK> banks .
the idea is to make sure there is always something in the bank .
"it may seem simple , but i honestly believe that if you put in a ton of time up front , it will get you through those teenage years ."
urllink paul <UNK> : why iraq is part of our war against terror
when exactly did we switch from a culture of hope to <#> of fear ?
or was it a far more <UNK> trigger ?
"all i know is , we 've become so <UNK> ."
it 's already been proven to us that our votes do n't really count .
not in the way we used to think they did .
"i believe that most americans are <UNK> , and truly do n't think they can make a difference in any way ."
and i 'm talking about everything from the electoral process to the way taxes are collected .
i firmly believe it all needs to be <UNK> .
"it ai n't workin ' , folks . and"
it clearly ai n't <UNK> the average jane or joe just making ends meet .
i think it 's easier for an <UNK> to achieve it than for those of us who 've lived here all our lives and paid taxes .
i 'm all for people getting out of <UNK> countries and making a better life for themselves .
i want this government to <UNK> out america . seriously .
$ <#> <#> is given to corporations because they are having hard times .
our defense technology is given to other countries .
we are spending billions outside of this country .
most of my friends are having to work <#> or <#> jobs just to get by .
a good friend of mine who was making a comfortable <#> figures in <#> has just declared <UNK> and ca n't make ends meet .
others have lost their homes and ca n't even get apartments .
creating a nation of homeless people is n't my idea of what this country is all about .
"so , i 'm telling our leaders - it 's time to put the money back into this country and its people ."
let 's organize and send our leaders a clear message .
this from a friend of mine who received the following email from the democratic national committee : * * *
but every single american should go to <UNK> immediately and watch the disgusting ad the <UNK> campaign has featured on the front page .
"titled "" the faces of john kerry 's democratic party , "" the ad features <UNK> hitler alongside democrats , including john kerry ."
"president bush 's campaign has <UNK> on negative attacks against kerry , but this is a new low ."
"we 've always said the bush campaign would do anything to win , but even we are shocked that they 've sunk this low ."
and we 're not going to stand for it .
"if president bush has any <UNK> at all , he 'll remove this <UNK> ad from his website immediately ."
man you could have prevented the trade towers disaster in <#> .
or so say the public and the media .
"<#> , <#> <UNK> , which if bush acted on , would have saved the world right ?"
"something tells me administration procrastination didn’t bring down the towers , but don’t get me wrong , i’m no bush fan ."
but i’m also no fan of <UNK> blame either .
"no , my friends , this group from the desert doesn’t like americans ."
"we’ve been their target for years , and it ’s our fault , plain and simple , not our governments ."
it ’s the way we live our lives .
"“ the truth is out there , ” <UNK> the motto from the <UNK> fox series , “ the x - files ”"
"so tell me , what would you have had done with this “ historical ”"
rather blanket of a warning that terrorists were “ planning attacks with <UNK> ” and that they were <UNK> “ recent <UNK> of federal buildings in new york .
” shake down everyone in the city ? do a door to door maybe
what would citizens be whining about then - invasion of <UNK> how many other multi - amendment <UNK> ?
"and they come in all shapes , colors and sizes ."
they walk among us <UNK> in our <UNK> and <UNK> our murder .
our own got us in oklahoma city in <UNK> .
"the world of want , <UNK> sealed our fate with his <UNK> , or maybe you didn’t read that ."
you <UNK> your <UNK> asking each of them to bring a copy of the constitution .
"no , blame it on the government and the <UNK> ."
"after the <UNK> , we’ll sure - up the federal buildings , make certain we have added security ."
"security we should have had all these years , especially since the world trade <UNK> in <UNK> but certainly before <UNK> and <UNK> in ‘ <#> ."
"security concerns <UNK> to private companies posting guards who smile and wave daily , who you <UNK> gifts upon during the holidays and who ask you “"
"how ’s the wife and kids , ” but for lack of <UNK> and sufficient training are relatively <UNK> in times of <UNK> danger and its resulting disaster ."
“ it ’s not my fault . not me .
can we accept <UNK> for anything anymore ? “
social challenges ignored because of our inability to better share the food supply and more equally <UNK> wealth .
"instead , we <UNK> for government <UNK> of tax money to which we all have our own spin ."
"man , we need more dollars for education and protection ."
traffic - no <#> can believe how bad it has gotten .
<#> tons of metal each moving <#> <#> pounds of flesh .
and even then you still won’t get it until it ’s your house burning or your child <UNK> .
american ’s aren’t looking out for each other anymore .
"we’re becoming a nation of <UNK> , <UNK> and a bunch of <UNK> . and if the war <UNK> us so , where ’s the <UNK> ?"
"i 've been mouse brown , and more recently mouse brown with highlights until today ."
actually the transformation started to happen last night around midnight .
"my highlights were growing out , i have a coffee date tomorrow morning , and i was ready for a fix ."
i happened to have a box o color handy ... boom !
"but i was a little red , and not embarassed red , hair red ."
"that was not the look i was going for , so today i paid a visit ( and $ <#> ) to the local salon ."
"matt did the color , and he is <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's ... if you need color he is your man - and he is n't even gay !
"he did a fix , and did n't charge <UNK> color prices - which would have <UNK> it up to $ <#> ."
so now i 'm a gorgeous blonde - the hair is gorgeous really !
nikki did a cut and style and she is great too ... seen her before and been very happy .
"the parents think it 's cool , the kids a little <UNK> out by it , but the neighbors like it too ..."
"<UNK> said hi in the parking lot , but i kinda blew him off ... he was chatting w a chick ."
"saw the personal trainer today , she said i looked good , but i think she 's talking out of her ass ."
"ok , so hair is done , nails done , and i have a cute outfit for the coffee meet ."
from now on we 'll see if <UNK> have more fun !
"i just got off the phone with hmmmm , gotta think of a good name for him ... fred ."
"yep , he 's mine and i 'm gonna call him fred ."
"fred and i were matched on eh , and he <UNK> me first ..."
you have to request to start communication ( whatever ) and he did it first .
so we 've been going thru the steps for a few days over a month now .
"he 's older than i am , and has a great job , lives in a nice area , wants the whole white <UNK> fence thing .... just wow ."
"we tried to i m , but he is n't the fastest <UNK> ."
"switched to the old fashioned phone , and neat ."
"he is cute , as far as the pics i saw , and <UNK> ... we have tons in common , and are meeting for coffee on wed am ."
the only red flag is that he wants to have a baby ...
"well , he does n't want to have a baby ."
he wants to marry someone who will have the baby .
"and that 's not even a red flag , it 's kind of a nice thing , but i 'm still not sure about doing that again ."
he thinks i 'm cute ! :) and
"ok , he is prolly someone just trying to get laid , but i do n't think so - at least i hope not !"
so i found a fellow on <#> of the sites last night who seems like just what i 'm looking for .
"i emailed , and he 's already gotten back to me ."
"i responded right away , which some people say you are n't supposed to - makes you look easy - but what the hell ."
"i asked for his time , the least i can do is respond when he <UNK> ."
"do n't know what we 'll call him yet , i 've got to figure that out ."
"my job is not demanding of my time , but it does suck the life right out of me ."
"so , i decided last night that i am going on a vacation ."
"i do n't know how , when , or with what money ... but i am going ."
"well , i do have a few ideas ... <#> of those all - <UNK> places - beaches , maybe even <UNK> ii ."
"i 'm going to be <#> this fall , and think it would be a really cool way to celebrate ."
"he 's just out for <#> thing , i think ."
"and , if he ever <UNK> - all i have to do is walk outside or peek out the window and i 'll have a pretty clear view ."
there are some distinct advantages to dating a neighbor .
"and some advantages , he is always there ."
going out with someone who has seen you at your worst can be pretty interesting .
"i do n't get dressed to the <UNK> to go to <UNK> , and he sees that ."
he also sees the done up me when we 've gone out - and he likes that very fine thank you .
":) he is a little older , a month shy of <#> years older ... and like the irish <UNK> has no kids and no past marriage ."
"the thing with <UNK> is , he does n't do events or <UNK> ... he is more of a couple thing <UNK> , and not a double <UNK> even ."
he mentioned once that he would n't marry someone with kids unless hers were out of the house .
"um , hello , there are <#> kids in my house and i do n't see the little <#> going anywhere for another <#> years or so ."
i do n't think he knew i heard that - we were standing with a group of other neighbors .
"he is ' interesting ' and i like that , but the only thing - i would eventually like to settle down ."
"not in the very near future , but hopefully before little <#> is off to college !"
"and if i wait that long - gosh , he 'll be <UNK> !"
"the irish <UNK> has a perfectly irish name , and is attractive ( almost cute ) ."
ah but now the man is n't <#> of your usual men she dates .
"although the <#> usually go together , sometimes they are <UNK> - see jc ."
the irish <UNK> is a mighty fine catch .
"we 're a few dates in , but the calls are <UNK> down ."
i guess i need to get up to speed here ...
"local <UNK> is a fellow i met on a personal site , not <UNK> ."
he mailed me first ... and back and forth a bit .
"i sent a picture , and he wanted to meet - right away ."
turns out i 've dated ( kinda ) <#> of his best friends .
"more of a friends with <UNK> guy , jc and i have been flirting and <UNK> a kiss here and there for almost a year ."
"i would n't mind taking it to the next level with jc , but he is more of a play the <UNK> ."
"i can only imagine the look on my face when local <UNK> said do you know jc , <#> of my best buddies ?"
so local <UNK> and i hung out for almost <#> hours and as soon as i got in the car i called jc .
"buddy i love ya but ... please ! do n't tell , and give me the <#> on your bud ."
"i emailed <UNK> and said thanks , great to <UNK> ."
same back at me ... now i 'm waiting for his turn to come around and email me now .
he is cute funny and all that other stuff .
"kids great , family great , all the package is complete ."
how much you want to bet he is not interested ?
"well , i always have jc as a backup ..."
"ah , love ... exciting and new ... <UNK> ."
"ok , so i 've been doing the ' guided communication ' thing with a fellow <UNK> matched me with ."
we 've finally gotten to the phone call stage .
"he asked for my # , and i decided he seemed like an ok fellow"
"we talked for an hour and a half ... his picture is cute , and he has a child the same age as mine ."
"same religion , same basic <UNK> ... according to <UNK>"
we must have a bunch of things in common that i do n't even realize yet .
so why am i not on cloud <#> ?
"not by any means <UNK> , but just things that i need to think twice about ."
"not a bad thing at all , in fact a really awesome thing ."
"but , do i want to <UNK> get involved with an alcoholic ?"
"it happens , and i hope the child is n't suffering because of this . but should i <UNK> get involved with someone who has a child with problems ."
"i know , god forbid <#> of my children had issues , and would i want someone saying the same thing ."
"it seems he has a history of um , somewhat <UNK> ex 's ."
"well , i 'm going to reserve judgement for now ."
"we really do have a lot to talk about , and it is n't marriage ."
we 're going to go out sometime we can both get a <UNK> - hopefully in the next week or so .
"so , in the interest of being young and hip ( of which i am neither ) i 'm going to start a blog ."
"at least , i 'm planning on doing it ..."
just thought i 'd take it for a test dive .
"urllink <UNK> <UNK> - l ( "" tech - <UNK> "" ) is the internet - based community and resource for technical <UNK> worldwide ."
the <UNK> - l discussion list has more than <#> direct <UNK> and an estimated daily <UNK> of more than <#> people worldwide .
"<UNK> <UNK> 's ( need i say more ? ) website on "" <UNK> information technology "" ."

"<UNK> <UNK> language , or <UNK> , is a special kind of <UNK> <UNK> language , or xml ."
"as its name suggests , <UNK> was <UNK> initially to give developers specific language tools to <UNK> xml <UNK> ."
"these standards emerged out of a proposal for a <UNK> language , submitted in <#> , which was to be called ' <UNK> ' ( <UNK> <UNK> language ) ."
"however , during its <UNK> , this proposal was eventually pulled apart into <#> separate standards ."
"the first of these , <UNK> , <UNK> a mechanism for <UNK> information in xml documents , and it has many other uses beyond its role in <UNK> documents ."
"the second , <UNK> , provides a means for <UNK> xml documents into other data <UNK> , including ( but not limited to ) <UNK> languages ."
"finally , the term ' <UNK> ' is now properly used only to name a proposed standard for <UNK> <UNK> information in documents using xml elements ."
” we should note that there is actually some <UNK> to current usage of the term ‘
"<UNK> authors use it strictly to refer only to the entire family , while others appear to use it <UNK> with <UNK> - fo ."
"nonetheless , given the differences between the <#> parts of the <UNK> family , we should take care to keep them straight ."
the transformation language provides elements that define rules for how <#> xml document is transformed into another xml document .
<UNK> is the language for performing this kind of change .
but why would anyone want to do this ?
"<UNK> : an example <UNK> <UNK> gives several applications in his <UNK> tutorial , available online at <UNK> , which i used as the basis for the attached examples ."
"g. ken <UNK> , in the article what is <UNK> ?"
"given this confusion , we should try to <UNK> <UNK> ’s reference to “"
"<UNK> ” as <#> of the <#> parts named in the <UNK> definition , most likely <UNK> - fo ."
"in the xml bible ( again ) , <UNK> describes <UNK> - fo as sharing some <UNK> characteristics with css ."
"<UNK> - fo , however , is much more powerful and dynamic ."
"“ while css ( <UNK> style sheets ) is primarily intended for use on the web , <UNK> - fo is designed for <UNK> use ."
"you should , for instance , be able to write an <UNK> style sheet that uses <UNK> objects to lay out an entire printed book ."
a different style sheet should be able to transform the same xml document into a web site . ”
"of course , this <UNK> means that <UNK> - fo must use its own language for <UNK> and element commands ."
"<UNK> <UNK> offers a <UNK> reference of <UNK> - fo commands , with plenty of examples , at <UNK> ."
<UNK> is a non - xml language for <UNK> particular parts of xml documents .
"<UNK> indicates <UNK> by position , relative position , type , content , and several other criteria ."

i am a french born hong - kong guy .
i have always wondered what my life could have been if i was not born here but there .
"i have just started a new job after a year where i have been mostly doing nothing but having fun , meeting people and having a <UNK> ."
"yes , i kind of left my heart in hong - kong the last time i went there in december <#> ."
i stayed there for a month and a half and found out i really enjoy the life there .
"really i do , even if it is harder to leave in hong kong than in <UNK> ( france ) ."
"even if work is <UNK> , even if i would spend more time <UNK> , even if i would have less money ."
"i think like i belong there , i do n't read nor write chinese but i speak <UNK> ."
is it because each time i have been there was on vacation ?
now i want to try the real life there .
"last time i was there , i attended a wedding ."
"this time , i will also attend a wedding of very close relatives ."
"i often listen to a radio show from <UNK> <#> , <UNK> sir is on the mic and"
"always says : never give up ! from his point of view , anyone can start over from nothing any time in his life ."
"with everything i like about <UNK> , why do i hesitate so much ?"
i have to make up my mind in the next couple of months .
the stuff she says in her blogs is so relevant to me and i agree with it so much it 's unbelievable .
i have been trying to be more <UNK> and she is a model for me .
"he wo n't see anybody most days , including me ."
"he might be there , he might be off somewhere in another part of the world ."
"i 've found the ticket <UNK> , he ca n't fool me ."
"he goes there to eat , comes home <#> pounds heavier and wo n't come out of his room ."
how can i be the <UNK> to a person who is invisible ?
you gave me so much of yourself that i could not help give you everything in return .
you gave me your heart then you showed me your soul .
you whisper sweet words across my screen and tell me that you love me .
"you send me hugs and kisses , you made me love you and now you are stuck with me ."
my heart rules my life and sometimes my head screams too soon !
and i get scared so i pull away to save myself from getting hurt .
then i am too far away from you so i come back .
i never know my mind but i know my heart and for all the trouble that i am i love you ! !
"well its nearly <#> pm and i just got home from a relaxation class , which was really good ."
( hope that makes sense ) anyway it seems to be working .
deep <UNK> breathing and relaxed muscles that seems to be the answer .
"why do weekends go so quickly , back to work this morning and felt like i 'd never been away ."
today was the day i posted scott 's police force application form off .
and hopefully fingers crossed we will hear soon if he is selected for the first stage interview .
"played yu gi ho with my son charlie tonight , somehow i think he cheated but not sure how at this moment in time !"
"well this is my first every attempt at having a blog and i am no expert here , so please bare with me ."
scott went off to kent this evening to start a <#> week training course as part of his <UNK> <UNK> with the army .
"must get some sleep , it takes me about <#> days to recover from a really good night out nowadays , i hate to admit ! !"
thank you to the best friends in the world .

"{ { giggles } } the highlight of the evening , for me , was the birthday poem that turtle wrote for me ."
i wonder what happy accident i’ll find to celebrate today ?
i’ve been noticing how much <UNK> music sounds ; how much brighter the sun is shining ; how much richer foods taste .
"i love looking at the <UNK> , <UNK> of flowers . everywhere"
i look these days i’m seeing so much beauty and love .
i’ve suffered with low grade depression most of my life and i never would have thought that being told my brain was broken would <UNK> the <UNK> of depression .
"i’ve been feeling the <UNK> to live and love life so fully , deeply , <UNK> everyday . today"
i thought i was ready for this ; it turned out to be a huge mistake !
when i quickly realized that this wasn’t good for me i just immediately stopped and went about <UNK> around the house for a while .
i then sat down on the couch next to turtle and <UNK> like i haven’t yet really cried about this .
"reading the harsh realities of what could , or will eventually happen to my body wasn’t fun ."
"my wonderful love , my family , my friends , <UNK> it hurts me ."
turtle told me he was glad that i was a little scared because that meant i would do everything i could to stay healthy and well .
it felt good to cry and <UNK> it all out and of course an <UNK> came from the experience .
"love myself , be gentle with myself , have some patience and watch my brain begin to heal ."
updated the song list and added some <#> 's related links ...
i 've started to put together this <#> 's tribute .

"on thursday june 17th , scratch had played an afternoon show @ <UNK> school in <UNK> ."
chris <UNK> is leaving as a music teacher and going to a high school in orleans to teach another music program .
chris had been a teacher there for <#> years and it was his way of saying goodbye to his students .
"when we went on , the kids were screaming so loud it was beatles - like ."
"we only played a <UNK> of songs , but it was quite a rush ."
it was weird to talk to the kids afterwards and sign <UNK> .
well i made it thru ' the <UNK> fair alive ...
w/ scratch and sunday w/ sin <UNK> was fun .
"i was quite sun burned though , on monday morning ."
i 've started a site for the new cover band ...

i and alan have not worked too hard <UNK> with getting <UNK> black going like we had in june and july .
i have made <UNK> black my main focus right now .
"it was a hard decision , as i started the band almost <#> years ago and hated how things were going ."
"the main reason i had quit is because , several of the members did not want to play many shows ."
"i do n't know about ya'll but , as i said before i am a nice sized girl . and"
every now and then i like to go out with a friend to dinner and a movie .
"<#> thing i have noticed is that some "" large challenged "" folks look at me as if you have no business being in the restaurant ."
i get hungry and need to eat like every <#> else .
i am a meat and potato gal no <UNK> for me nothing wrong with that .
all the meat and potato eating sisters say <UNK> .
"if you can count how many black , homosexual , white , etc , etc , friends you have , then they are probably not friends ."
"true friends are not counted by race , creed , color , or sexual <UNK> ."
"and our friends well , they are just that friends ."
this is my first post so bare with me .
i 'm not the best writer in the world but i do have something to say .
most people know what that is but for the few that do n't that means big beautiful women .
now i 'm not gonna <UNK> on that fact because other then that i 'm like every other women .
my mouth just fell open i could not believe the nerve of some folks .
i know the pain that girl is feeling and will be feeling .
"so i decided to do a blog not just to share my thoughts , but to <UNK> if i can ."
we are all different that 's the way the maker intended us to be .
so never judge others variety is the spice of life .
so say hello to someone you never really took the time to know . or date a person just because they made you laugh .
listen to people even if they do n't have a degree .
but most of all accept <#> another with all our flaws ' cause that 's the way god made us .
you do nt have to go with the pack .
"sometimes you can , sometimes you must , but only because you decide so ."
"no matter how strong the outside suggestions are , you will ultimately be the <#> who decides what you will do ."
we have trained you to listen to what is right .
we have taught you not to accept anything with understanding .
"we have taught you where to base your <UNK> on , where to <UNK> your values on , taught you to choose what is right ."
the pack generally decides on the basis of what feels right .
you know that there are more important <UNK> than just what you feel .
you have been taught to base your decisions on established moral standards .
you have witnessed how we have tried to live according to those standards .
those standards are based on god 's word - the bible .
it shows us how to tell what is right and what is wrong .
i tell you this because time will come when you will have doubts about the credibility of the bible .
"this is because of outside influences , and not because you have not seen it to be true ."
the pack has a different set of values than what you have been taught .
"you can hear them , but i am confident that you will know what the truth is ."
"you have known enough of it to prove its <UNK> ; how time after time the promises god has given , he has kept ."
you 've seen it yourselves how he 's done that in our family .
"the pack will try its <UNK> best to get you to go along with them , but remember - you do n't have to ."
you will need courage to stand alone when the time comes .
"well dang , my pens at home do n't write as well as i want it ."
"but since working at <UNK> , the need to start <#> that 's honest to goodness has been really very urgent ."
that explains why i am trying to start this blog .
"i 've been in <UNK> since june <#> , after <UNK> from <UNK> on june <#> ."
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kaya <UNK> na rin na at least <UNK> <UNK> ko sa mga girls how my journey has been . and
"yes , while in a way this is a journey alone , it really is n't ."
"today is another chapter , which unfortunately , will have to be continued as my <UNK> is due to arrive real soon ."
"lots of nice sweet stuff on the outside , but inside you find nothing of the pleasant stuff you had when you first bit into it ."
"i want my kids to have a good future , and like the <UNK> 's mission , i have to build it now ."
"to start , they have to get <#> thing settled - god first ."
"well , heck , it never was ( people would rather put themselves <UNK> that is how i want my kids to <UNK> their lives on ."
the first step to that i believe is to have the same thing in operation in myself first - and it is .
i will not ask of my children what i can not or have not done so myself .
today i walked home after getting of the <UNK> and running an <UNK> at the store . with the <UNK>
i saved i bought a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> mais and enjoyed it along the <#> <UNK> walk home .
"i also took a different route than the usual , allowing me to see something different ."
the variety of plants and trees made for very interesting contrast .
"i am no tree specialist nor <UNK> <UNK> , and so i will not be able to tell <#> name from the other ."
"in fact , i will not even try figuring them out ."
"<#> thing – they sure looked lovely today . to me , at least ."
"but then you realize that our heavenly father will <UNK> the universe to provide for those he truly loves , in order for us to enjoy a simple treat ."
the <#> <UNK> i saved from taking the <UNK> is a small thing compared to the <#> minutes i spent of the road home .
here is what i gained : - <#> minutes of small talk ( but oh so intimate ) with god .
i enjoyed him so much together with his treat of <UNK> mais .
- a reminder that faith isn’t about seeing how or where you ask for will come from .
” - i saw ( compared to “ i read ” ) what the bible meant when jesus talked about “ the <UNK> of the field ” . of
how indeed <UNK> ’s fashion could not come close to how those trees and plants today looked .
"if those trees looked <UNK> , man , god will never leave us in a sorry state ."
"when i consider and weigh the <UNK> , i would say i got a good deal on the <UNK> <UNK> savings ."
"for you , this i say : don’t take these small , simple joys for granted ."
"the edge of what i 'm not quite sure yet , but i can feel the <UNK> <UNK> of something waiting to swallow me whole ."
"i feel it there , yet i just stand here on the edge , looking around , checking out the weather , looking at the trees ."
basically trying to look everywhere but into the <UNK> .
"standing on the edge of something much to deep ... what is it in me that refuses to believe , it 's easier than the real thing ."
"i ca n't sleep , and i 'm exhausted ."
"i ca n't seem to get comfortable since i 'm tired of laying on my back , and it pulls my <UNK> to lay on my side ."
"i think most of all i am mentally tired , worn out , numb ."
"my food is gone , my comfort and my drug is gone and i do n't know what to do without it ."
i feel like a <UNK> that 's been thrown in <UNK> only i 'm the only <#> here .
"i do n't have the daily group therapy , no <#> encouraging me to "" let it go "" or "" tell them how i really feel "" ."
i feel like i 'm slowly <UNK> while at the same time frantically trying to hold all the <UNK> ends together .
"i have the fear of not losing the weight , of being <#> of the few for whom it wo n't work as well as for others ."
i 'm mostly afraid that the results wo n't be worth what i 'm going through now .
i have been emotionally <UNK> for so long that i do n't know if i can handle the flood of crap that is on it 's way .
getting this surgery has popped the <UNK> on my emotional bottle and it 's been shook up good so stand back !
only after a couple of months i start to feel all the emotional <UNK> pushing to the surface and i get scared .
i feel like if i let it go even a little that it will completely <UNK> me and i wo n't be able to control it .
kind of like the <UNK> ( only with a better script ) .
i know i need to go into counseling but that scares me too because i am afraid of what i will say .
i have things <UNK> deep inside me that would turn my whole life and the lives of others upside down if i revealed and admitted them to myself .
it almost makes me throw up thinking about them .
but please god do n't let me go back on anti <UNK> .
not being able to have an orgasm was worse than being depressed .
i need help and i need it fast .
"i need spiritual help , professional help , personal help and a little divine intervention ."
i 'm scared that loosing the weight and losing the food excuse will make me actually live .
i have had the excuses for so much of my life i 'm not sure how i will handle not having any .
this story is famous among my friends and since i’ve been asked to repeat it many times i think it ’s time i just write it down .
"several years ago , i was going through a dry spell sexually ."
"before i was with my fiance , i almost always had a sex buddy ."
i actually managed to wear out a <UNK> during this time .
"in fact , the <UNK> had worn out a few days before this incident and i hadn’t managed to get a new <#> yet ."
yet i decided to go have drinks with friends anyway .
if i am horny before i start drinking the <UNK> will only get worse .
"i had <#> or <#> beers – good friends could tell i was drunk , but i wasn’t <UNK> or silly ."
"and between my hormones and the beer , he suddenly seemed attractive enough ."
so we got to his place . and began messing around .
not that i hadn’t been planning on having sex with him .
it was just that he had the biggest penis i’ve ever seen in my life .
including those i’ve seen in porn movies and websites . and
while i’ll be the first to say that size does matter –
i now point out that size matters in both directions .
"looking at him , i knew there was no way that i was going to get laid that night ."
i knew i couldn’t handle anything that big .
i actually find performing oral sex more intimate than <UNK> .
"also , i wasn’t even sure i could get that thing in my mouth ."
ben <UNK> my <UNK> and decided to <UNK> me .
he reached in his <UNK> and . . . . .
he poured some on his member while i stared in shock .
"and then i thought , well now , you’ve never tried this –"
i grabbed my stuff and ran out the front door .
i turned the car on and pulled my sweater over my head .
as i began to back out i saw ben coming out his front door .
i drove home as quickly as i could .
"at least i’m not horny anymore , i thought ."
"i was wide - awake , though , so i decided to check my e - mail ."
"a few minutes later , someone knocked on my door ."
amanda is getting so <UNK> she missed school yesterday and today she had to come home twice !
she 's <UNK> out on the couch getting annoyed because i keep telling her drink water ...
on to other stuff .... i went and made my very own <UNK> to do list at work today . with it being <UNK>
i can use it as a dry erase board and it works really slick ( oh the things i can do with <UNK> clips and sheet <UNK> ! )
unfortunately i filled the damn thing up so fast that i should have used legal paper !
the bad thing is that it created yet another little job ...
"linda is calling me a "" <UNK> ass "" again ... it 's <#> of the greatest compliments she gives !"
i discovered a bonus with having it hanging up for all to see ...
"i was asked to write up a document , and told him to just add it to the <UNK> when he saw the list he asked <UNK> ."
"there is a term for someone who will do what you ask , but make you sorry you asked in the first place ."
it 's not passive aggressive or passive <UNK> i 'll remember eventually .
i have to attend the <UNK> training conference with my supervisor tomorrow .
is that really so difficult a concept to grasp ?
that 's not to say <UNK> are bad things ... just not the way i prefer to learn new things or meet new people .
"part of me is so filled with pity , but i 'm keeping my <UNK> <UNK> in check because i know it would only <UNK> his confusion ."
he made a public post to <UNK> 's group about what he believes is going on after he read about my conversation with dawn my diary .
"i apologized to <UNK> for the situation this puts her in because , like it or not , i 'm the focus of all this insanity ."
i 'm so sad and frustrated because i had been concerned about taking the risk to meet someone new ...
it 's going to be a long time before i extend friendship to anyone new .
i 'll try to <UNK> for those who may not be aware of the insane situation i find myself in .
it was all with the intention that he would have at least <#> person up here that he sort of knew so it would n't be all strangers .
the first meeting was n't really a meeting at all .
we picked him up at the airport and dropping him off where he 's now living which took a total of <#> hour .
it was almost <#> weeks before we met a second time on the 18th .
"after spending a significant amount of time in his company , i determined i was not interested in anything other than friendship and told him that ."
"so we finished our meal , i dropped him back at his home , shook his hand and said goodbye ."
"he said his expectation are <UNK> meaning he <UNK> that the chances are slim of anything more developing "" for now "" ."
i respond and tell him that i am the <#> who said there could be no expectations and he agreed with me at the time .
"i also stressed that for friendship to even be possible , he needs to abandon any expectations he may have regarding me ."
brian <UNK> that i should try to keep it short to limit the possibility of him taking something i say as encouragement to pursue a friendship .
"i pretty much told him that in light of his most recent e - mail , i do not believe that friendship is possible ."
he calls me on the phone and says he is willing to accept <#> % <UNK> for the <UNK> in the hopes that we can resolve this dispute .
"all i could think as i played the message was "" what part of no do you not understand ?"
i can see now that i dismissed a number of comments he made that in light of the events of the past few days are serious red flags .
i asked dawn in security to take a look to get her take on it and she asked me if i had a gun .
"she also suggested that she keep them as dated evidence so that an outside party has proof of me ending the "" relationship "" ."
now i feel like i live in minnesota ... <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> .
brian and amanda wo n't be going out this evening !
we 'll probably just record my shows and we 'll stay warm and <UNK> .
i came home to find brian running a cable to the <UNK> while installing the tv he bought me !
the meeting last night about the level <#> sex <UNK> was rather <UNK> .
mostly the police officers wound up being the punching bag for the people in the neighborhood .
"they took it well , and tried to be informative without being defensive ."
it turns out that this johnny miller has been living here for <#> weeks already and has quite a history .
"he 's been in and out of prison for <#> years for <UNK> women ages <#> - <#> with many <UNK> for <UNK> , drugs , and domestic abuse ."
"he has a <#> % chance of <UNK> , and has always stuck to areas and victims near his residence ."
he is going to rape again.. we need to make sure it is n't amanda or i this time .
i think that there should be some self defense classes offered at the <UNK> centers .
i spoke with the <UNK> director and the security supervisor .
"if i can find an instructor and get the local business association to pay the fee , then they would <UNK> the fee for the classes ."
i may take another step and contact the <UNK> foundation or child find minnesota ... they have some pull with the police ...
i 'm just the mother of a teenager .
my mind is so distracted that i completely <UNK> a sign i was working on .
"<UNK> <#> "" <UNK> on <UNK> using only a <UNK> , a box <UNK> and a <#> "" rubber <UNK> ."
i was rushing too so after <#> attempts and <#> failures i finally gave up .
karen asked me to make up a quick summary for the director of parks using data from the <UNK> submitted by the <UNK> .
he liked it so much that he has told all the other <UNK> in parks to use the same format .
helps take the sting out of the fact that i have made a big mistake in my personal life .
i extended friendship to someone who has decided that i was offering much more .
"mostly i 'm just annoyed , and concerned that i 'm going to hurt his feelings ."
i bought the most beautiful <UNK> cover and a down <UNK> ...
my bedroom is going to be red and gold and absolutely lovely .
we picked him up at noon and came back to the house because amanda wanted to come to the <UNK> and <UNK> with us .
"she even ate a <UNK> that brian gave her ... something she never does around anyone else , of course no <#> else just <UNK> her ."
bob challenges her so she has to go outside whenever he is over .
the <UNK> was a really nice break from winter .
"we 're all kicking ourselves for not having gone earlier , and will try to make a regular thing of it when it gets cold ."
"i needed to hear the birds singing , and smell fresh earth ."
"he did say that he would be patient and was "" in it for the long haul """
"so i had been concerned that he was expecting more to come of it , but he assured me that he had no expectations ."
so it was a good patch of time .
we stopped at target afterwards and i finally bought myself some new shoes ...
"i looked at the high heels , and the slip <UNK> ..."
even some nice dress <UNK> what do i buy ?
i bought an <UNK> dresser too so tomorrow will be spent <UNK> it .
i was just going through some boxes under my bed and i found an old pipe with some very old ash in it .
it 's been so long that i lit it anyway just to remember the taste .
i had n't really thought about how long it 's been since i had anything fresh ... must be <#> years now .
"<UNK> i 'm not addicted , but man i miss experiencing that wonderful sensation ."
"not worth getting arrested over it , but if any feel in my lap i sure would n't throw it a way !"
we just received a notice about a neighborhood meeting .
it turns out that a level <#> sex <UNK> is moving in just <#> blocks away .
i feel helpless and i do n't like that <#> little bit .
i 'll attend the meeting and that will help ... being around other parents who will likely feel the same way .
i think the <UNK> worked ... although i 'm not counting my chickens yet ... sticking to crackers and <UNK> tea just to be safe .
"a visit to the como <UNK> , a swing through downtown to see the ice palace being built , and then off to <UNK> for an early <UNK> lunch ."
it will be nice to finally spend some time getting <UNK> .
our first meeting was very short and did n't allow for much conversation .
i wish i 'd had more time to let others know so they could make their plans .
brian has his <UNK> group on saturday so i do n't know about when that will end .
"i could always go myself , but i really do n't like to spring sudden plan changes on amanda ."
i 'd like her to know that home is the <#> place she can count on for stability .
"brian is starting to feel better , but he was pretty miserable as well ."
i think i was running to the bathroom every <#> minutes .
"he told me it hit him as well , so it had to have been something the <#> of us ate ."
"i called in ill at <UNK> , laid back down and did n't wake up again until <UNK> ."
she stayed home today too because she had a dental appointment in addition to feeling sick .
"i tried eating something mild for lunch , but it went right though me ."
amanda and i have decided that a <#> hour fast with lots of water wo n't do us any harm .
ok.. i 'm feeling much better today i get depressed and then everything seems so overwhelming .
"i had a talk , i told him how i feel and we 've agreed to try some things as a compromise ."
he agreed that i really need to have my own space so he is going to remove his things from the bedroom
"i will likely invite him in regularly , but it 's my call ."
"i 'm at a point that i need to make a decision , and no matter which choice i make , i 'm going to be <UNK> ."
each day it is getting harder to find a reason to keep going and i 'm starting to wonder why i even bother .
"i 've kept hoping that he 'd get it , but i 'm losing hope ... and hope really is the only thing that keeps us alive ."
the order of events is in no order what - so - ever .
"first off , i survived my first experience of opening day of permit season ."
i was on the news twice much to my dismay .
i had n't realized just how gray my skin looks in <UNK> lighting .
i 'm glad i at least had a chance to shower .
i do n't ever want to start work at <#> am again ... at least until next year .
by 3:30 my brain was such <UNK> that i could n't even <UNK> the fees without using my fingers ( nice representation of government employee there ) .
i went right to sleep and did n't wake up again until around 8:30 ...
"just long enough to eat something , brush my teeth and go back to bed at 9:30 ."
"we were supposed to go to a party , but brian said i just sort of <UNK> at him so he went ahead without me ."
"i 'm glad because it was <UNK> 's first party here in minnesota and if i could n't be there , then at least brian was ."
i 'm really sad that i missed it though.. it sounded like an absolutely wonderful time !
i did wake up when he got home and made him tell me all about it !
"<UNK> thought it was funny that i would have thought they forgot about it , but it was even funnier that i forgot about it too !"
"to start with , she had been upset because the toilet had been <UNK> around the base ( the wax seal obviously ) and"
she just ca n't afford a <UNK> ( but she is on a first name basis with the sales people at marshall fields ) .
"well , that was the final straw and she had a little mini break down with an office full of customers ."
"she was even more upset when she got back though because on top of the <UNK> fee , she has a ticket now ."
the really sad thing about it is that it could have been avoided .
i 'll just take it as a lesson on my part to look at all the options
so i do n't end up in the same fix .
hopefully she will have had a good weekend when monday come 's around ...
just before brian had to pick me up he found amanda walking around the house in her <UNK> and slippers crying .
once he got her calmed down he came in to survey the damage .
thankfully it was all contained so it was a simple matter of rolling it up carefully .
now we just have to figure out what to do with it so that there are n't any glass <UNK> anywhere .
i 'm somewhat pissed because i 'd mentioned a couple of weeks ago that i thought <#> of the screws had pulled away from the wall .
i made the mistake of trusting him to repair it on his own ( <#> minutes ? )
"so did n't feel that i needed to check on it , but i 'm kicking myself because i know that i need to ."
"i 've asked if he wants help , but he just <UNK> at me and says "" no , i can do it myself ."
""" i can hear him crying he 's so frustrated . still"
<UNK> he just asked me what i wanted for my birthday .
how do i say that i want to have place i enjoy coming home to ?
"instead , this house is so <UNK> that i feel <UNK> most of the time , which is n't doing a thing for my <UNK> pressure or my depression ..."
sometimes i even have trouble breathing because there is so little room .
and this was before my clothes all ended piled up on the couch .
i 've pretty much <UNK> myself to living in a place where there are just <UNK> .
every now and then i 'll come home and the living room with be cleared and <UNK> ...
of course it 's all been piled on the bed in our bedroom .
"i 've stopped asking if he had company because he gets insulted by the <UNK> ... despite the fact that the answer is always "" yes "" ."
i just enjoy it for the few hours that i get it but it makes me feel so worthless that he wo n't clean for me .
i 've learned not to open the bedroom door because that 's usually just too much of a shock .
instead i announce that i 'm going to go brush my teeth and he brings the mess back out into the living room
"he gets angry that i do n't show more appreciation , but it 's hard to do when i 'm waiting for the other show to drop ..."
he has a serious pack - rat problem and it 's becoming apparent that there soon wo n't be room for me here anymore .
"his stuff has taken over the basement , the living room , the <UNK> and most of the bedroom we share ."
i 'm slowly going insane not having even a little closet under the stairs to be alone if i want to .
"oh , man i could go on and on about the empty boxes and pet food bags folded and set on top of <UNK> units still in boxes ."
"i 've tried to do it for him , but it 's just wasted effort ."
he fills up the space faster than i can clear it .
"i still do n't know how <UNK> and <UNK> could have had a living room , bedroom , fridge and microwave down in the basement ..."
"i ca n't even get to the washing machine any more ( last time i tried , i got hurt stepping on a saw ) ."
i want something that he 'll never be able to give me ... a comfortable home in which to live .
"i started out very happy when i started writing , but in the past hour i 've become very down ."
"if it was n't so cold , i 'd just go sit in my car and listen to the radio ..."
"i really can only see <#> possible way to make it a reality , and i 'm just not desperate enough for that yet ."
i really pitched in and helped clean up some <UNK> yards with the <UNK> crew .
"i was lifting tires , <UNK> dog poop and even ran the <UNK> ."
"my back started to <UNK> up after a few hours back at my desk , and by the time i got home from work , i was totally exhausted ."
problem with that of course was that it was too nice to stay in bed ! ! !
"i did some very light yard work , burned some wood and got tons of fresh air ."
my back feels fine if i keep taking my <UNK> and i should be fine .
<UNK> and <UNK> hosted a meet and greet at a bar in st cloud .
"i ca n't do the smoke , so i hosted a after party at a hotel nearby ."
we had a lot of fun and did n't wrap up until after <UNK> .
it was good to see familiar faces and meet a new <#> .
i ca n't wait until we can all get together again .
"it 's just so small , and <UNK> is so <UNK> of strangers even near the house that it 's not even a possibility to host a party here ."
it was a nice mini vacation and a bit of a rite of passage at the same time .
this was the first time ever amanda was home alone over night .
i of course am mildly <UNK> out over the whole thing ...
"she got a bit nervous because <UNK> kept barking , but it 's a <UNK> routine for our neighbor 's cat go exploring in the alley ...."
it 's time to <UNK> our territory <UNK> again .
i 'm having a nice day today watching the race at <UNK> .
i was joking to brian last night that he 's a <UNK> <UNK> ...
"i have no interest in any other sport , but i just love racing ."
i 'll need to go <UNK> boot shopping later today ...
tuesday it 's my turn to go out with the <UNK> crew to see what they do .
i wonder what excitement i 'll experience when i go out .
"i have a great respect for the job that the <UNK> crew does , but i do not want to pick up someone elses garbage !"
i decided to take a break from the public <UNK> of my thoughts for a while .
i figure that <#> weeks would be long enough for that <#> particular freak of nature to get over it all and leave me in peace .
i 'm back now that spring is definately on its ' way .
"well , we 're still standing , and so is the tree ..."
<UNK> and the girls lost part of their roof .
"brian lost a bunch , but that 's what casino 's are for , right ?"
today is going to be a busy busy day .
i just took <UNK> for her walk to the park .
"i enjoyed it very much , and <UNK> is exhausted !"
only mildly teased at work today about getting locked out of the house .
i 've been calling around to get tree services to give <UNK> on taking the tree out and it 's not looking good .
the first <#> said $ <#> and that does not include <UNK> the <UNK> or dropping the power lines to do it
our old <UNK> metal shed that was partially crushed is finally a pile of flat <UNK> ready to be <UNK> off to the <UNK> place ...
he 's been having a rough time completing things .
he had <#> heavy blows to his self - esteem ...
"the result is now that the mattress is on the floor , and her <UNK> are in the front <UNK> and she 's happy"
i do n't blame brian completely for the <UNK> <UNK> things come up that suddenly have a higher priority
it 's a hard choice because just thinking about the number of times we are forced to make due and settle for temporary <UNK> is downright pathetic .
"as long as i 'm depending on brian to fulfill his promises , will i ever be able to look forward to something being done ?"
"or will my life be a series of "" good enough for now "" quick <UNK> that are never completed ."
"the original agreement was that i would pay the bills , and he would , with his <UNK> skills , take care of the household chores and <UNK> ."
"i do n't deny that he tries , and that he does help ... the difference"
"is that he never ever has to think about the bills , not rent , <UNK> , insurance or <UNK> it 's something he can depend on ..."
i wonder at times if i 'm having commitment anxiety or if he changed ...
... is there any sanity left worth fighting for ?
"today was my last day off for the long weekend and rather than being relaxing , it 's been quite eventful ."
so know everyone at work is going to have a field day with the locked out jokes . back to work tomorrow
he was right here watching the race with me as he and i have done for <#> years .
"it does n't seem that long ago , but at the same time it feels like forever ."
"just as he was getting used to the idea that this was his second chance , he had a massive heart attack out of the blue ."
what a horrible time that was for all of us ...
"the shock of cancer , the worry over the surgery , the joy of <UNK> and then the sudden death of someone we loved so much ."
it 's her birthday today and so i called <UNK> to make sure she was going to be home .
<UNK> said she was n't going anywhere and asked if we wanted to suprise her
", i said that if she was going to be there , do n't bother to say anything ."
"so we went over there , but no answer ,"
"<UNK> decides to call over there and tells mom to come over right now , but would n't tell her why ."
"well , she was in the tub and comes racing over in a <UNK> wrap because <UNK> makes it sound like an emergency !"
"so there 's mom opening gifts from amanda , brian and i practically naked ."
she really enjoyed them ... especially when she was able to go back and finish her bath .
rita 's dad died at 5:30 this morning .
"it 's weird because she told me on monday that she knew he 'd die on wednesday and sure enough , he did ."
"work is going to be nuts , especially this time of the year ."
it 's unfortunate because there is going to be such a sense of relief and then the guilt for feeling that way .
we did n't get a chance to get to <UNK> today .
"no <#> was feeling particularly well , and the idea of being ill and being in the rain did n't appeal at all ."
instead we worked a bit in the yard .
"brian finished the alley steps , and we were able to fill in the low spots with some leaves and <UNK> ."
"it will shrink , but hopefully by fall the <UNK> will be in so it wo n't matter ."
i really wish he 'd get rid of the truck .
"it 's becoming very peaceful , but then my eyes hit that ugly truck and i cringe !"
the vet called today to let us know that the mass <UNK> had removed was not <UNK> .
... likes the pain killers and is healing quite well .
"we 're supposed to limit her activity , but that 's quite impossible ."
you 'd never guess that she 's <#> years old .
yesterday the cats had to go in for their <UNK> and dental <UNK> and the vet discovered a mass on <UNK> 's <UNK> .
thank heaven i have the <UNK> <UNK> plan because it would have cost me over $ <#> ...
so she 's back on <UNK> again as well as <UNK> .
she 'll have to go back in <#> weeks to get the <UNK> removed and get the <UNK> because she could n't get them and have surgery .
amanda had to go in to the dr as well because she has another ear infection .
they had to try a different <UNK> for her because she just finished a round for the right ear .
"oh , he 's out in his shed working on a shut of thing for the dust <UNK> he 's been working on for months ."
"so guess who has to deal with it all , the mom of course ."
it really pisses me off that i ca n't get <#> lousy day..
"just stuff for me to do for me from <#> to <#> it 's not even a day , its <#> hours ."
i do n't know why i even bother trying .
i do n't know what it is with people .
"i had been chatting with someone who seemed really excited about meeting in person , so i arrange to meet them ."
i double check the times and locations to make sure there is no <UNK> and i just end up sitting there for <#> minutes .
"granted we were n't supposed to meet until 4:30 and i got there are <UNK> , but i waited until 5:00 before leaving ."
it has been months since i even considered meeting anyone new so it 's really annoying .
"brian said that rejection is hard , but it 's not about being rejected ."
"needless to say , i wo nt ' be bothering making any appointments with this individual again ..."
"his first impression was , to put it simply , non - <UNK> ."
<#> of the reason 's work was so crazy is that rita had to go home .
"about a week or so ago , her pit bull bit her other dog <UNK> ."
so she finally realized that she 'd better have him put to sleep before he attacks <#> of her <UNK> .
"her eyes were so <UNK> and <UNK> that she could n't function properly , so it was better for her to just go home ."
"i brought brian breakfast in <UNK> he really liked that , then we went off to the <UNK> picnic at como park and met some friends from <UNK> ."
then we hit the library and grabbed an ice cream cake .
we had a lazy day until we started getting hungry and i <UNK> a couple of pizza 's from papa <UNK> .
"tried the chicken club , but it was n't to our taste ."
"i 've fallen in love with the <UNK> <UNK> chicken , so it 's my new favorite ."
oh man it was just so amazing i ca n't even begin to describe it .
we have decided that we will try to see a live performance at least once a year .
"amanda wanted the soundtrack , but the <UNK> set was $ <#> and that was more than a ticket so unfortunately we could n't get it ."
i 'm going to have to keep an eye on amazon or e - bay .
we went out to great moon which is our favorite place because you can pick your own ingredients and have them cooked up in front of you .
"my favorite recipe is lamb , <UNK> <UNK> , bean <UNK> and <UNK> onions with garlic and pepper ."
i wonder if it 's an actual asian recipe or if i created it .
we decided to swing by <UNK> 's to shock everyone with brian 's new hair .
of course they went nuts and think it 's just a great look for him .
"it still <UNK> brian when he looks in the mirror , but he 's getting used to it ."
:) after we left <UNK> 's we decided to pop into target and there were lots of street <UNK> on university .
i had completely forgotten about the <#> 's car show at the state fair grounds .
it was a blast to see all those old cars .
<#> was showing off it 's sound system and got pulled over right in front of us ... the <UNK> .
:) but we went way out of the way to see as many as we could .
"if i was a <UNK> , i would love to have my own blast from the past ..."
it 's not a car for your average consumer .
it 's the same time and location as the <UNK> pride picnic so we 'll just have to make an appearance .
went to st cloud for steve and penny 's party tonight .
"penny was n't able to attend which left me being the sole female .... which is fun , but can feel a bit overwhelming ."
we were having an really enjoyable time when some kid came walking down the hall knocking on doors .
"it was like a <UNK> of cold water , and we just could n't get back into a party mood ."
i felt bad for steve and hope that he was able to <UNK> the cost .
i know how expensive it can be to have a hotel party .
had dinner with wendy on thursday and it was so nice to catch up .
she was telling me about her friends that make up her goddess circle ...
"the whole concept sounds great , and it 's easy to see how happy she is knowing she has these "" sisters "" in her life to turn to ..."
it 's a real good example to me of how <UNK> happens if you just let it .
the only annoying thing was that olive garden changed their recipe for seafood <UNK> ...
"it use to be shrimp and <UNK> , but now it 's shrimp and sea <UNK> with chopped red bell pepper and i do n't like it ."
"the <UNK> was the same as always , but the conversation was the high point ."
"i know schedules are tough , but i hope we get to catch up before another <#> months goes by !"
"it seemed simple in the instructions , but zip !"
"his hair is about <#> "" long all over his head ."
"it does n't look bad , but it is strange to seem him with such short hair ."
"the big plus is that his head feels as soft as velvet , so i ca n't stop touching it ."
"he said if this is the result , i can keep <UNK> it short ."
in a month it will probably fit him better .
"i did remember that we are going out saturday to see les <UNK> at the <UNK> , but figured that it would n't be so bad ."
"amanda wanted to see a real musical , and it 's been quite <UNK> ..."
i think this is the 2nd run through the <UNK> .
"i was n't expecting brian to be interested , seeing as how he is tone deaf , but he thought it would be great"
"the better seats were sold out so we are in the balcony , but we have field glasses ."
what a strange couple of days it 's been .
"<UNK> brought fluffy over yesterday , and oh , he was such a little love ."
"<UNK> would n't leave him alone , <UNK> and cleaning him constantly ."
"when i was cleaning his ears however , he shook his head and blood and <UNK> came flying out ( <UNK> ) ."
he was still <UNK> so it was my hope that it was just like a tick that i <UNK> .
brian brought him into the vet and we got some very bad news .
"fluffy apparently had very advanced <UNK> <UNK> and a severe ear infection , gum infection and <UNK> infection ."
along with the <UNK> all over his skin and under the <UNK> there was just no way he was going to heal .
they ran all the tests twice and had <#> <UNK> examine him before telling us that the only thing to do would be to put him to sleep .
"<UNK> is great though , she <UNK> all the exam and blood test fees ..."
it was only $ <#> for the drugs to put him to sleep ( they have to keep records of that stuff ) and the <UNK> .
he held fluffy during the process and he <UNK> right to the end .
"oh it was horrible to tell <UNK> , but he as <#> other cats who have had long term exposure and are likely to need treatment ."
i did n't pay much attention to it until after 8:00 for the sunset service .
"it was sweet to hear the humor from his children , i especially loved the <UNK> memory from his daughter ..."
reagan said her final goodbye and started to cry .
i ca n't imagine having to <UNK> in such a public eye .
there were thousands of people watching at the ceremony and millions watching all over the entire world .
i was shocked when i was about to leave work today .
<UNK> came up to me and said he had enjoyed working with me and would miss me .
he never said a thing about getting his transfer request approved .
i do n't like a lot of fuss made over <UNK> and things like that .
"my "" funeral "" will be quite simple ( if anyone respects my wishes of course ) ."
"brian , <UNK> , <UNK> , amanda and i went and saw harry potter on saturday evening ."
"we had hoped to see the 7:30 show , but they sold out just as we got there ."
so we bought tickets for the <UNK> and went to get some dinner .
it really bites because i <UNK> against monica 's fence and <UNK> the car to get there on time .
we got back to the theater by 8:30 and had a hell of a time finding <#> seats together .
amanda sat by herself in front of us so she could see better .
"lots of stuff missing from the book , but it was a <UNK> book ."
i do n't know what they are going to do with the fourth <#> !
brian spent most of the weekend helping <UNK> and paul replace his roof .
"we 're considering it , but a lot depends on how our cats and dog cope with the addition ."
the heat really rolled in today ... i was n't expecting it until wednesday
so i was quite impressed that brian was able to get the main ac in by the time i got home from work ...
and i was ready to turn my <UNK> on !
i stepped outside and almost could n't breathe because the air was so hot and heavy .
he 's still very sore from working on the roof so carrying the small ac units up from the basement is not a task he 's excited about doing .
"i have been buying more "" girl clothes "" ..."
i have n't had to buy a new pair of jeans in <#> months
so i decided it was safe to buy nice stuff .
i just found out today that rita 's pit bull norton killed her little blind puppy max over the weekend !
"she was n't home at the time , but what happened was that her oldest son nathan was cleaning his room and her youngest ryan was helping ."
a pig ear was <UNK> from nathan 's room and ryan put it on the toy box .
"norton must have found it , and the puppy max wandered too close and norton attacked ."
it 's weird because over the weekend was an incident with a family that owned <#> <UNK> .
"personally , i do n't believe that just anyone should be allowed to own <UNK> animals ."
of course i 'm not thrilled with <UNK> either .
"i know that the that <UNK> animals have a longer life <UNK> , but you know what ?"
i ca n't imagine that a creature even more wild than myself would n't feel just as strongly .
"the clever part , however , comes in where the target company ( i.e. its <UNK> ) are given as <UNK> for the debt ."
in essence the target helps <UNK> its own <UNK> .
", presumably under the belief that it leads to the most efficient <UNK> of capital and <UNK> ."
"this is commonly referred to as the "" no financial assistance "" rule ."
"it is not a blanket <UNK> however , and the uk provides for a "" <UNK> "" test ( what we would call a "" safe harbor "" ) ."
"the "" <UNK> "" rules will not be covered in this posting ."
france and germany similarly have rules against financial assistance for much the same policy reasons as the uk .
"france allows no <UNK> , whereas german <UNK> can be <UNK> generally to <UNK> with the legal tests ."
there remain open issues as to whether and how the <UNK> of the eu will <UNK> national corporate legal policies .
"for now , <UNK> within a country are controlled by that country 's corporate legal structure ."
"as shown here , europe can be quite a different playing field that the u.s ."
"[ many thanks to focus europe summit <#> , and urllink gibson , <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for source materials on this topic . ]"

"so , i just had an interview today for a promotion within my company ."
"so , at this point i 'm not really blogging ..."
"i 'm just trying to find my old buddy noah , and i had to create a blog just to do that ..."
"maybe i 'll use this , maybe i wo n't ..."
i might have a lot to say in the future ...
i 'm leaving for <UNK> on wednesday to compete for <UNK> ms .
"... i have laundry to do , and cleaning ..."
i 'm not going to be able to sleep until this is all over ...
"i 've been hearing that a lot lately "" everything happens for a reason ."
i lost out to someone who already lives in <UNK> and who is already in a position higher than me .
"actually , for the guy that got hired , it 's a <UNK> move ."
"so , it 's not so much that i was beat , it was that i was beat out before i 'd even heard about the race ."
"so , i 'm not bitter or upset ."
"heck , it now just means that i do n't have to move out of state ."
"i had so <UNK> myself in that role , so to speak , that i now have to re - gear for <UNK> ."
i no longer have to <UNK> on <#> hours of drive time to get anywhere south of me .
"oh yeah , by the way , i won that thing that i went to in <UNK> ..."
that was another part of below - mentioned weekend ...
"okay , so i met someone about a month ago ."
"met her first in person actually , not online , and we hit it off straight away ."
well ... that weekend was just too <UNK> short .
"so , we exchange e - mails and kept in touch for the first few weeks ."
"well , we 've been writing to each other nearly every <UNK> e - mails , text messages , all that <UNK> technology to have simple conversations ."
"nice thing about communicating through e - mail , though is that you can think out full sentences before they leave your mouth and cause <UNK> damage ..."
"okay , you can still cause <UNK> with even well thought out e - mails , but that 's not the point of this particular entry ... luckily ..."
"so , we 've been e - mailing and such ."
"and i have a photo of her , and even some video footage ."
"and she has access to photos of me , and yes we have met in person already ."
but the majority of our communication has been cyber .
"so , after about <#> weeks of e - mails and aim , she invites me to her place for beer and movies and such this past weekend ..."
"she lives close enough ( <#> hour drive ) that it 's not an epic journey , but a bit too far to just pop in for tea ."
and i had a great time in our day and a half <UNK>
i have to remind myself that yes she does actually exist .
"i mean , i am fully aware that she is an actual person that does live and <UNK> there is video ."
but our physical time together has been so very brief .
and it does n't help that there was beer involved ... clouds the memory and all that ...
next time we hang <UNK> there needs to be less beer and more kissing ...
"mom and dad , tell us about your first homes when you were both kids ( your earliest <UNK> ) ."
"so , i 've been trying to figure out a way to get it down for <UNK> in the limited time"
"i have ( with family , church , urllink initial images , urllink neighborhood christian school , staying in shape , etc . ) ."
"i thought that with the <UNK> of the internet and blogging , a solution has presented itself !"
i hope many of our relatives will also find this avenue the way to go .
what i have in mind is to pose a question about an event or time period and then have everyone respond from their perspective . with this
", we 'll be able to get <UNK> from all over the place and be able to <UNK> an awesome historical perspective of our family ."
( remember ... these postings will be on the internet and open to everyone in the world .
"also , this will not be a place to air <UNK> , but to save those great memories we have of our families ."
"i do n't see why the blog postings should be limited in scope , either ."
"that is to say , if you and/or your family relates to the event , time period , topic , etc ."
", then let 's hear from anyone related , not just immediate family or those most directly involved ."
"well , let 's try to get this started and see where it goes !"
look for the first topic posted after this <#> ! enjoy and may god bless you !
took <UNK> ( the dog ) for a check up .
went to find this wonderful green house that i have heard about .
"question , when do they <UNK> normal working people to be able to get there at that time ? ?"
"yes , i was lucky that i had the day off ."
"so , i came home and looked though a new cook book ."
i love having <UNK> chef parties and meeting new people while teaching new and interesting tips .
"does anyone else , have or has to endure the pain and <UNK> of <UNK> ? ?"
sometimes it is so hard to keep up the happy face .
you just want to <UNK> out at everything and everyone .
"and , of course , you end up feeling guilty for that also ."
"but , the thing that eats at me the most , is the people that act like they know what you are going threw . and"
"later on , you hear something like , "" oh , it ca n't really be so hard ."
""" ahhh ! well , thank you everyone for letting me vent ."
"i was just watching michael moore 's documentary , "" bowling for <UNK> ."
""" he 's seeking to understand why the u.s ."
"he <UNK> various reasons that people often gives : video games , violent movies , music lyrics , guns , etc ."
the most intriguing part is when he interviews various canadians .
"any reason for america 's violence that you give , it seems , does n't make sense when compared with canada ."
the clips <UNK> that america 's culture of fear is at least partly to blame .
i wonder what <UNK> have to say about all this .
"when i was younger i sometimes got hooked on video games , wasting huge amounts of time and money ."
"<UNK> is of course a very good thing , but not when it becomes an obsession ."
"some people can no longer travel for fear of <UNK> ( viruses , <UNK> ... ) ."
some ca n't stop washing their hands because of the same fear .
sleep is a great <UNK> if you 're spending too much time thinking about something .
there 's not much to be afraid of in everyday life in japan .
"consider our <UNK> , who had to survive animal attacks , disease , and the day to day struggle for food ."
"on some level such fears remain , however , in our <UNK> ."
these fears mostly make us feel like we need more money .
money is insurance against disease and lack of food ( but would n't be able to help us in the case of an animal attack ! ) .
"fear nowadays can be entertainment , as is the case with horror movies ."
"it 's a bit of a rush , perhaps a mental connection to our <UNK> past that makes us enjoy horror movies ."
"well , i do n't really enjoy them , but can in some cases , like the silence of the <UNK> ."
"there 's a very narrow stretch of road leading the <UNK> , where i teach ."
"there 's barely enough room for <#> cars , let alone my car and a truck ."
everyday as i drive to work i wonder if i 'm going to get crushed by an <UNK> truck .
"on some level there is fear , and the deepest reason is , i do n't wanna die !"
"walking <UNK> asks , moved because the old woman gave him money ."
"<#> person sees a homeless person and sees "" social garbage "" ; another sees the same person and feels sympathy or compassion ."
"knowing that there are starving people in the world moves me , and <UNK> me ."
"i try to look at the big picture , however ."
"tossing a few coins at a homeless person may not solve anything ; in fact , it might make the problem worse ."
"now that i have a son , i think i need to know that he 's healthy to be happy ."
"of course , i personally need to have enough food , water , a warm shelter , and friends to be happy ."
"there are certainly many other things that make life rich : spending time in nature , listening to good music , etc ."
"i can go without these things for awhile , but stress often builds up if i do n't enjoy nature or listen to music for too long ."
"i have to say , that given how lucky i am , i am almost always happy ."
"i 'm happy to be alive , and want to enjoy every day fully ."
"so , most of all , i need to be alive to be happy !"
( i 'm not sure if dead people can feel happy ... )
"i 'm interested in <UNK> , and the buddha taught <UNK> about the nature of desire ."
some people say life would be boring without desire .
"but , perhaps it seems that way because the main <UNK> of our lives is seeking pleasure and avoiding pain ."
i believe desire is a <UNK> way of think built into our brains .
"dna has created many patterns of living , growing , and in animals , thinking ."
"eating , drinking , sex are all key to survival -- of ourselves and of humans in general ."
but perhaps we do n't see how deeply desire controls us . and perhaps we ca n't imagine the freedom and joy that would come if we <UNK> desire .
"walking <UNK> is , to me , very impressive ."
"the thing about money is , it 's never enough ."
"of course , everyone wants security , and in modern societies money provides , in a sense , security ."
in ancient times you had family and community to rely on .
i try to overcome the feeling of always needing more money .
as a professor at <UNK> i 'm satisfied with my salary .
"i ca n't say it 's a worry , but it could be if i had a low paying job ."
"anyway , in my view , money is not bad or evil , but it can be like a poison if you 're not careful ."
it 's a little embarrassing to try to answer this question directly .
i believe it does n't come naturally to humans .
"after all , throughout history , and throughout the natural world , animals strive to survive ."
our <UNK> had to look after themselves to survive .
"of course i have to take care of myself , but surviving is not a day to day struggle ."
"i can afford to think about the welfare of other people , and of animals ."
"focus on ourselves and our own problems and our own desires leads to suffering , i think ."
i believe trying to help others makes our own lives more <UNK> .
what do you need in regard to food ?
i really only need <#> meal a day -- but after awhile i 'd need <#> .
perhaps because my habit is to eat large meals .
"in fact , i do n't need any particular foods , but if certain foods are in the house i ca n't resist eating it ."
i 'm relatively free in regard to drinks too .
"i could just live on water , but in the winter especially really enjoy some sort of <UNK> drink ."
my body is very sensitive so i stay away from <UNK> drinks .
"i do n't drink <UNK> , generally , or <UNK> ."
most of us need food -- but does everyone ?
i know an indian <UNK> who says he went <#> years without eating solid food .
"he told me this personally , and that he was strong during that time and worked hard ."
"some do n't believe it , but do we really know the potential of a human ?"
"most of us think we need much more than we actually need , perhaps ."
is a very broad question with no easy answer .
"walking <UNK> , the writer of the story , sets out on a journey to <UNK> into this and other important questions ."
"he <UNK> the challenge of the question , and the challenge of finding answers despite the enormous difficulty involved with giving up all money and possessions ."
"his is an act of trust , a brave act of trust that he can survive , and that his needs will be met ."
few people have the mental or physical strength to attempt this . and
"when i ate lots of sweets i was , in a sense , addicted ."
"then , for several years , i ate no sugar ; i completely gave it up ."
"in this sense , freedom was a lack of desire ."
this sort of freedom is very profound and worth seeking .
the democrats may stage some <UNK> in eastern washington this year .
don <UNK> is running an amazing campaign for the united states house of representatives .
"this is the seat that tom <UNK> , democratic speaker of the house , had for years ."
"when george <UNK> <UNK> it away from him , it seemed that it was going to be republican forever ."
"but now <UNK> is running against patty murray , who is going to <UNK> him . and"
"at the more local level , tom <UNK> is running for the state house ."
"he was running against dave <UNK> , an attractive <UNK> fellow who first won as a democrat and then switched parties ."
"frankly , <UNK> probably did n't have a chance against <UNK> ."
"but then <UNK> dropped out , and now <UNK> may have a chance after all"
"see urllink "" for <UNK> as for people , life in the big city has its risks as well as its rewards , "" monday , june <#> ."

"in any case , i would think of a "" <UNK> "" as basically a good thing , a place where <UNK> women could go , for instance ."
"it means "" free of jews "" and is seriously <UNK> by the <UNK> ."
there 's an interesting review of a german novel about the 18th - century <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> of higher education .
"the novel , <UNK> and the little flower girl , is by <UNK> <UNK> ."
"urllink urllink the review urllink certainly brings out the clever , witty , <UNK> of <UNK> 's <UNK> ."
it puts more of an emphasis on his <UNK> than i do in my chapter on <UNK> 's <UNK> in warm brothers .
"<UNK> married a <#> year old ( the "" little flower girl "" of the title ) , which i think <UNK> on some level as queer ."
"in yesterday 's episode ( # <#> , parallel play ) , <UNK> and joe use a condom , which is a reminder of the presence of aids ."
"in another recent episode , nan <UNK> 's photography <UNK> claire -- and nan 's photography featured people living with aids quite <UNK> ."
"this evidence perhaps seems a little weak , but it is part of a pattern that has continued since the series began ."
i 'm currently working on an essay on the subject .
"otherwise , i 'm a little concerned by some of the plot lines ."
i do n't like the direction that <UNK> 's heading !
"for instance , are we going to see a generation of gay men who are saving themselves for marriage ?"
"this a bit obscure for many of you i 'm sure , but i have lots of friends in germany for whom this is big news ."
"a few years ago , the social democratic government put into place some educational <UNK> ."
"they created "" junior <UNK> "" which would be open to <UNK> who had not completed the "" <UNK> . """
"the "" <UNK> "" is essentially a second <UNK> that was <UNK> a requirement for a <UNK> ."
"so you wrote your <UNK> to get your <UNK> , which would qualify you for a position as an assistant professor ."
it was not <UNK> to become an assistant professor at the institution where you completed your <UNK> .
then you would write your <UNK> while you were an assistant professor in order to be qualified for a full <UNK> .
"the germans did not have the <UNK> - track system , so it was unlikely that you would become a full professor where you were an assistant ."
the big <UNK> to the <UNK> is that it keeps young <UNK> in a <UNK> position until they are middle aged .
"not only do you have to write your <UNK> , you have to get it approved ."
"so here you are , in your late <UNK> or early <UNK> , <UNK> to some senior professor ."
"however , the <UNK> system is not as different from america as many german <UNK> imagined ."
"so we have a de <UNK> <UNK> , but without the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> that can decide not to accept a <UNK> ."
the bottom line is that the <UNK> was not the reason for germany 's problems in higher education .
the article notes that the <UNK> meant that few people became full professors until their early <UNK> -- but that 's the same in the us as well .
"lots of people do n't finish their <UNK> until they are in their mid <UNK> , and then it takes ten years to get promoted to full professor ."
"i am in favor of getting rid of the <UNK> , but this court decision is not the end of the world for german education ."

urllink the village voice : features : the next <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK>
i 've been watching the convention as i prepare to move to new york .
"i 'll actually be in new york city for the republicans , but i 'm having to watch the democrats from my own living room ."
"despite what everyone has been saying , i 've found it pretty exciting ."
i just do n't think hillary has the presence to be a national political figure . but bill is great .
he looks like he 's lost weight . and even urllink andrew sullivan thought his speech was jaw - <UNK> good .
"carter 's was the better speech , but clinton was magnificent ."
i think he was better last night than at either of his own conventions and certainly better than any of his <UNK> .
he performed a brilliant <UNK> trick : he <UNK> the usual <UNK> used against him to <UNK> kerry .
"rather than attack the wealthy as <UNK> of tax cuts , he attacked himself as a now - wealthy man ."
"and then the <UNK> de grace : he put himself and bush in the same camp as draft - <UNK> , in <UNK> comparison to the patriotic kerry !"
my jaw was on the floor at that point in a mixture of <UNK> and horror .
and the way in which he described the cost of the tax cut in terms of <UNK> attempts to improve homeland defense was another smart move .
use the republican tax cut issue against the republican security issue .
"if the constitution did n't prevent it , the man would still be president ."
"after last night 's speech , you can see why ."
"in fact , in general , i like sullivan 's comments on the conference and it 's been a while since i 've liked his writing ."
"i did n't mind his talk , but others found it <UNK> ."
"ron reagan , jr . , was good , i thought ."
"this is a magnificent <UNK> that we heard in portland , on our way to the coast for a family reunion ."
"we 've been trying to describe the sound of the music , which is described as "" <UNK> - <UNK> , third - stream "" jazz ."
"for some reason , film <UNK> has dominated my thoughts while listening to her music ."
when we were there the street outside was lit by a street light and was actually brighter than the bar .
"so , from the bar , you could see people walking up and down the street , which is narrow , almost like an alley ."
they would stop outside the window and look inside and listen the music before moving on .

urllink the <UNK> : <UNK> : <UNK> to <UNK> of <UNK> at german universities
this urllink new york times article gives a surprisingly <UNK> account of the difficulties facing gay republicans .
some people are even threatening to * out * them !
the best reasoning on outing is still in richard d. <UNK> 's gay ideas : outing and other <UNK> .
his main argument is that <#> has to out if <#> wants to remain an honest person .
"you may want me to keep a secret , but you do n't have the right to make me lie , just to protect your secret ."
he also makes a useful distinction between privacy and <UNK> .
"that is to say , they certainly have a right to privacy ."
"but the public would quite <UNK> find it very strange to discover halfway through a political campaign that a politician was married , but had never revealed this fact ."
"the public would think that this politician was keeping secrets , not <UNK> his privacy ."
urllink the new york times > washington > proposed marriage ban <UNK> washington 's gays
"i 've been trying to publish an op - ed piece on this subject for months , but have given up and decided to publish it myself ."
"seriously , this was <#> of the reasons for developing my own blog ."
"perhaps this would be a good time to step back and take a look at the history of homosexuality , marriage , and civil rights ."
"in fact , this debate is not new : calls for gay marriage are as old as the concept of homosexuality itself ."
"in order to have gay marriage , you need to have gay people ."
"the statement may seem obvious , but for much of human history , people were not <UNK> as homosexual or heterosexual ."
<#> is often considered the “ birth of the homosexual .
"” in that year , the german - <UNK> liberal <UNK> karl maria <UNK> <UNK> the term “"
homosexuality ” in an appeal to the <UNK> minister of justice to <UNK> <UNK> .
"significantly , the term appeared in the context of the political debate about the <UNK> of the new nation of germany , which was to be established in <#> ."
liberals such as <UNK> wanted to be sure that equal rights would apply to the newly <UNK> category of the homosexual .
<UNK> ’s ally on many of these issues was a <UNK> lawyer named karl <UNK> <UNK> .
"in <#> , <UNK> published the first issue of what he hoped would become a journal called <UNK> for his fellow <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"if there are individuals with an <UNK> <UNK> to love members of their own sex , he <UNK> they should be allowed to marry ."
"already in <#> , there are <UNK> calls for gay marriage ."
<UNK> and <UNK> were both far ahead of their time .
<UNK> remained illegal in the new german state and stayed that way for a century .
gay marriage had to wait even longer before it became the subject of political debate again .
"nonetheless , there are some lessons that deserve to be learned from this chapter in the history of sexuality ."
"once homosexuals are no longer considered criminal or mentally ill , it becomes hard to deny them the rights granted other members of society ."
"far - <UNK> liberals like <UNK> and <UNK> saw that over a century ago , and a slim majority of our <UNK> seem to understand it now ."

i know there are questions about how to use this blog .
it 's a little confusing at first ; it took me a while to figure it out me - self .
so <#> of the big question marks is : commenting vs. posting ?
say you just got back from a trip and want to share a report with the rest of us .
this is just <#> example of when you 'd want to create a new post ( which others can then read and comment on ) .
"so , where do you post your new story ?"
"does n't look like there 's any way to do it here , does it ?"
"you 're probably thinking the policy here is , "" no <UNK> , no laundry . "" well ... not so fast there , <UNK> ."
"first , you need to go to a different web page ( meaning : different than <UNK> ) ."
"that other page is known as your "" dashboard "" page which is like a control panel ."
( important : be sure to add that page to your <UNK> so you can find it again . )

they are quoting a price of $ <UNK> for the same first - edition copy of ' my brother jack ' that i brought recently for just $ <#> !
"<UNK> , mal :o ) urllink email"
"luckily , my friend kay speaks and reads and writes japanese <UNK> ( english too ! )"
", and she pointed out that , <UNK> speaking , "" <UNK> "" is actually spelled "" <UNK> "" ."
"<UNK> to see black <UNK> ( <#> of my favorite bands ! ) , <UNK> priest , <UNK> and black label society ."
so here 's the pencil drawing for the piece i 'll be <UNK> to the tokyo monster show .
"the <UNK> script says "" <UNK> "" , which means "" let 's go "" ."
"i drew some inspiration from the urllink <UNK> <UNK> logo , urllink <UNK> 's chest <UNK> , and urllink female <UNK> ."
"looks like i 'll be <UNK> a drawing to the urllink thunder <UNK> sushi <UNK> at urllink <UNK> art gallery in santa <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"i had a great idea for a drawing ( <UNK> vs. <UNK> ) , but i 'd never finish that <#> in time ."
i 'll post a sketch when i have <#> . <UNK>
"i painted on saturday for the first time in ... oh , say , <#> months or more ."
it felt great to realize that i can still use a brush !
"also got a call from my friend urllink craig , and he asked me to submit a piece for a group show with a “ monsters ” theme ."
"don’t know much more than that yet , will keep you posted . so here"
<UNK> just point <UNK> to the damned thing hanging on their office wall and expect you to be impressed .
... maybe my website should just be <UNK> of my <UNK> <UNK> and then you could just take me at my word that i’m a really good artist .
"not only that , i can create a diploma in about an hour with <UNK> <UNK> ."
"if you’d like a degree from chicken state university , let me know and i’ll set you up for a reasonable “ tuition ” fee ."
"seriously , do you ever call the school your eye doctor went to and ask for his gpa ?"

"i saw the new king arthur movie last night ... for free , thanks to friends at <UNK> ."
there ’s <#> particular battle on an icy river that ’s pretty remarkable .

"i won’t spoil the movie for you , but let ’s just say that the <UNK> aren’t down with the pope ."
been working on iron <UNK> shirts ... hope to have them finished today .
"that ’s right , i’m going to a pork - off <UNK> hosted by my friend jonathan ."

"it is like that in yoga and religion , which is working toward divine union ."
"jesus said , "" blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled . """
"he also said , "" seek and you will find ."
"knock and the door will open to you . "" this is the magic formula -- desire toward a goal , which <UNK> action toward that goal ."
""" devotion is the continuous flow of desire toward an object or goal ."
we are all familiar with the concept of devotion .
it is how we explain the success of great <UNK> :
""" oh , she is so devoted to her work . """
""" oh , she is so devoted to god . """
it is no coincidence that devotion and greatness are found in the same place .
the second can not happen without the first .
"whatever your concept of enlightenment may be , whatever tradition or creed you hail from , whatever <UNK> you in the direction of spiritual <UNK> , <UNK> that ."
it is what <UNK> us to <UNK> daily spiritual practice for as long as it takes .
"as we practice , our divine experience grows , and , with that , devotion grows ."
"increased devotion <UNK> our commitment to practice , and more dedicated practice <UNK> more divine experience which in turn increases devotion further ."
this is how it <UNK> -- devotion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> divine <UNK> <UNK> more <UNK> and so on .
devotion <UNK> at a fever pitch by every means possible is the spiritual <UNK> 's best friend .
"it is not always an easy life being constantly consumed by spiritual "" hunger and thirst , "" but it puts us on the royal road to enlightenment ."
intense devotion to <UNK> our lives through advanced yoga practices <UNK> that what must be done will be done .

"thinking of a curse to stamp into the pages of my collection of <UNK> old <UNK> books , to stop people not returning them ."
"cheap custom rubber self - <UNK> stamp company , here i come !"
"ok , maybe that was an <UNK> and my curse needs some work . not to mention the fact that i rarely lend out my books ."
"like a <UNK> <UNK> , i have drifted <UNK> to the shore of this island that is my blog ."
"what <UNK> , but heh , i 'm only on day <#> ."
"<UNK> update : i do n't know about the <UNK> of this , but here is a urllink link i found to be quite amusing ."
it basically describes the practice of placing <UNK> in library books to ensure the book 's return .
"i think i will institute this practice at home , maybe even get a stamp made up to save time ."
"like most people , i want my <#> <UNK> of fame , unfortunately you have stumbled across this site and my wish has become a pathetic reality ."
a hobby is just what i do n't need .
"feel free to <UNK> me and this blog , i could do with the material for my collection ."
"... a curse shall be developed to put on every single person using the internet , except those whom i <UNK> ."
"by "" bet "" i mean about $ <#> ."
"meanwhile , a urllink link relating to a <UNK> on an ex - lover ."
"i do n't feel quite so fed up today , just really tired ."
i had to get up during the night for a pee ( oh the joys of being pregnant ! ) which consequently disturbed the puppy .
she then decided that she needed to pee aswell and so i got up with her .
"there really is n't much on the television at <#> am so it was pretty boring , but once i 'm awake , i 'm awake ! !"
"so there we sat , watching <UNK> , hoping beyond all hope that boredom may just <UNK> me back to the world of nod ."
"i eventually managed to get her into a different position at about <#> this morning , and i have to get up at <#> ! !"
"i suppose , as someone trying to be funny said , that this is maybe good practice for getting up for night feeds with the baby ."
"i have tried to rest up a bit today to make up for the sleep <UNK> , but there 's so much that needs doing around here ."
unfortunately i do n't seem to have the enthusiasm or energy to do any of it .
i just kind of sit there thinking to myself '
"oh i must get those <UNK> down in a minute ' , then think , ' exactly , in a minute ' ."
there was an article about ' <UNK> - <UNK> depression ' .
i ca n't say that i 've ever heard of this before .
"<UNK> it 's quite common , i think maybe because we all such <UNK> ideas about how pregnancy is going to be ."
i assumed that my pregnancy would be like the last <#> only to be proved totally wrong .
"oh well , it 's nearly time to go get the kids from school , best go and at least wash up ! !"
well this may be incredibly boring to most of you people out there in cyber land .
i 'm just writing this to get a few things off my chest .
"being a mum of <#> with another on the way , and being so very ill with this pregnancy , i do n't get out much"
"so this seemed like a good way to talk , without actually having to talk to anyone ."
"i thought this would get better once i actually stopped work , but its pretty much the same ."
"instead of worrying about going back to work and what the week holds for me , i now fear being left here alone again for the whole week ("
there 's just no pleasing some people eh ! ) .
"i love my kids , but they drive me mad ."
"anyway , i digress , the puppy is really cute but is not house trained ( <UNK> and piles everywhere ) , and <UNK> a lot ."
"i really have n't got the time or the energy to play with her constantly , i try to as much as i can though ."
"i have gotten over the morning sickness , but still feel <UNK> at times throughout the day ."
"now before you say it , yes i do trust my husband ."
"i can honestly say that i have never trusted anybody more than him ,"
but i also know what a kind and caring kinda guy he is .
he spends a significant amount of time on the internet on a certain website ' chatting ' to people .
i 've spoken to him about it but i 'm sure he thinks i 'm being silly .
"i do n't know , but i do know that it 's getting me down ."
"well that was my very first moan , i feel a little better i suppose ."
let 's wait and see what happens next then shall we .... .... <UNK>
well today i decided to be a good parent and go to the annual <UNK> report to parents at my children 's school .
i 'm kinda glad i did go in a way because only about <#> other parents turned up .
consequently i was at school until nearly <#> pm because i had to go over both the <UNK> work ( quite <UNK> ) lol .
this kinda made up for the morning i had .
i have desperately been trying to get my hands on my form <UNK> ( certificate of pregnancy ) for the last week .
i need to have it for my <UNK> by the time i reach <#> weeks or i will loose my <UNK> pay .
also my husband needs it by <#> weeks so that he can register his intention to take <UNK> leave .
my <UNK> eventually decided to get back to me today to tell me that i could n't have it until i had reached <#> weeks .
"so i spent most of the morning chasing my tail , trying to find out what to do next from my employer , my doctor and the <UNK> alliance ."
well i suppose today could have been worse ... .... it could have been monday ! ! !
"it would seem that this has turned into somewhere where i just go to moan , but never mind . today i have discovered that i am totally useless ."
"i have gone from an <UNK> woman who has her own income and can provide for herself and do everything for herself , to a <UNK> useless idiot ."
i seem totally incapable of the most basic tasks for <#> reason or another . today whilst trying to <UNK> a shoe rack it fell on me .
"yes it was a little painful , but not enough to usually reduce me to tears ."
<UNK> i then started to feel sorry for myself and realise that this was something i could have done standing on my head in the past .
when i moved into my house ( <#> years ago now )
"it was a <UNK> , totally <UNK> for human <UNK> in my opinion ."
however i put my nose to the <UNK> and did my best to make it better for myself and the children .
"i did this without any trouble at all , but now even something like sorting out a chest of <UNK> has turned into a major ordeal ."
"i just feel useless , like i can no longer contribute to the family , and that i am putting too much pressure on my already over <UNK> husband ."
"i think the strain has been showing on him lately too , he seems very <UNK> with things as they are ."
i just do n't know what to do to make things better .
i sometimes feel that i just get in the way and make things worse for everybody . and guess <UNK> ....
"yes tomorrow 's monday , guess which day is n't my favourite day of the week ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?"
well here we go again on yet another moan .
for the past <#> hours or so i have felt generally nasty .
i did n't sleep very well on friday night and was up at early o'clock saturday morning so on top of feeling like poo i was <UNK> aswell ! !
according to all the journals and bits and pieces on pregnancy i should be in the ' <UNK> ' stage .............. <UNK> awful if you ask me ! !
there was me being all <UNK> thinking that this pregnancy would be the same as the rest .
i should have realised things would be different as i am now that much older .
i 'm totally fed up with feeling ill and useless .
it makes you feel like you 're letting everyone down .
i went to bed for a lay down yesterday afternoon and just cried and cried .
"oh well , i had a decent nights sleep last night so maybe today will be a bit easier ( i hope ! ) . once more unto the <UNK>"
"so now i am suffering with a bad case of ' giant baby syndrome ' , or"
at least that 's what i have <UNK> decided to call it !
the <UNK> is that i have to go for another scan next week to check the real size of little - bump .
"oh well , maybe they 'll discover that my dates are totally wrong and it will come early"
", i do hope so , this heat is killing me !"
"why is it that children nowadays seem to think that parents were put here solely for entertaining their children ? or , is it just my children ?"
when i was a child my father worked strange shifts and my mother did n't drive .
we lived in a small village about <UNK> from the nearest town and the bus service was virtually non <UNK> .
asking my mum if we were going anywhere nice today ' would surely have earned me a clip around the <UNK> !
"i 'm not saying that i never got bored , i just knew better than to complain about it and managed to find things to do to <UNK> myself ."
this happens if they 've only been complaining how bored they are minutes before ! to make matters worse
the kids ca n't seem to get along for more than about <#> minutes before they 're at each other 's <UNK> ( quite literally ) .
they do n't seem to be able to see that they 're driving you mad until you 're nose to nose shouting at them .
i just do n't know how they can be so unaware of people 's feelings .
"i love them to death , of course i do , i just could really do with them not being around at the moment ."
"but , about an hour before kick - off , i thought : "" mmm , maybe put a little <UNK> on for interest <UNK> . """
this even though i watch football in all its forms whether i have a bet on or not .
pound on <UNK> to score first goal and portugal to win <#> - <#> - <#> <UNK> coming to <UNK> de <UNK> .
"ah , the wonders of urllink online gambling !"
"it was actually <#> of the most enjoyable games of the tournament , too ."
"following on from yesterday 's post , the strike by members of the <UNK> on the tube really kicked in today , with services being <UNK> ."
this meant long walk to work this morning and tonight - but hardly the disaster that was made out in the - sadly - much - read evening standard .
this boy <UNK> from south east of the city to north west this morning - and what did this mean for <UNK> ?
a <#> minute journey rather than <#> that takes <#> minutes !
and it was pretty much the same coming home .
"er <UNK> , the boy and <UNK> have been having theme dinners during the course of euro <#> ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> potato salad , <UNK> steak , spanish chicken <UNK> and good old fish n chips have all featured so far ."
"tonight , we will be mostly having <UNK> chicken <UNK> <UNK> - it promises to be hot and it promises to be tasty ."
"before i go , though , excitement of the wrong kind entered <UNK> 's world last night ."
""" someone 's <UNK> a kicking out there . """
bloke 's english is n't that great - and he was rather <UNK> and confused - and he hands phone to <UNK> .
<UNK> tells police where to rush to and where to bring ambulance .
<UNK> finds that the boy has <UNK> placed his cricket bat in hall for defensive purposes ( what a <UNK> the boy is ) .
<UNK> goes back to finishing george p <UNK> 's the sweet forever .
<UNK> thinks <UNK> is <#> of the greatest crime fiction writers of all time .
<UNK> also thinks he gets really right wing when crime comes close to home .
<UNK> hopes that <UNK> get <UNK> and get a right kicking .
but <UNK> is a complex character and wants the <UNK> ' head <UNK> on and balls kicked .
london <UNK> workers have told their <UNK> that enough is enough and are currently taking part in a <UNK> strike .
"management , for weeks and weeks , new that this strike was threatened , so what did they do ?"
did they follow the example of network rail and put their top <UNK> at work looking for ways to resolve the dispute ?
did they get round the <UNK> table with the tube workers ' union the urllink <UNK> ?
"london mayor ken <UNK> then got involved , inviting members of staff to become <UNK> - a great <UNK> is our ken ."
"but then , with the strike only hours away , top management suddenly thought that they should make the effort and get into talks with <UNK> officials ."
"far too late to call of the strike , however ."
"and what does our blessed media do - make it out to be a few "" <UNK> "" in the leadership who have caused the <UNK> ."
"while we should never be surprised at such activities by the propaganda arm of the state , we still are ."
let 's ignore the wishes of the membership and concentrate on the personalities .
"to quote <UNK> c <UNK> : "" i should know - ah <UNK> wan ! """
i love it when the organised working class show yet again why there is power in a union .
"er <UNK> can see the downside already though , by just <UNK> : "" i 'll never get on the computer now ! "" anyway"
speak to you all ( i.e. nobody ) soon .
"please bear with me , this will be up and running sometime very soon , but first i have to go and cook dinner ."
london is so alive in a way that no other city on this planet is .
had <#> of those great london nights out last night .
"got home at around <#> am , but , with no work to attend , felt fine after a lie in ."
just about to head off to catch train to <UNK> with the boy .
it 's always good to run through this list just once on each <UNK> .
"go to start , then run and type <UNK> <UNK> and click on new command - line tools ."
i learned about this <UNK> at <UNK> and just had to share it ...
"if you 've heard of <UNK> , then <UNK> will make it useful ."
it 's a command line interface for <UNK> that does n't require <UNK> .
it also allows you to access <UNK> on windows <#> computers through the network .
it gives you <UNK> information about your computer in an easy to read web page among other <UNK> .
try this on an xp or <UNK> test computer .
"you could add to it like this : <UNK> <UNK> get <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK>"
you could also use it <UNK> by typing <UNK> ( enter ) and using / ?
it contains a great deal of information about lots of stuff .
"okay , <#> more : <UNK> <UNK> get <UNK>"
want a quick way to find information about a windows xp computer ?
"it can be <UNK> , and the results can be placed in a file ."
there 's a new microsoft <UNK> coming out that will test your <UNK> skills .
"have you noticed that when you try to find a file on your hard drive , windows asks you more questions ? that drives me crazy ."
it logs <UNK> and <UNK> port activity on a local windows system
"ever wanted to use a <UNK> , <UNK> , or maybe a <UNK> ?"
"if you go to start , run and type <UNK> , it will lead you to a host of symbols you can drop into your documents ."
don’t forget to check out the font called <UNK> in there to see the <UNK> font characters ever .
ever double click on my computer and wish you could get to the list of <UNK> ?
"click it , go to advanced click explore , then set default ."

find a folder with word <UNK> in it .
right click on the grey name bar and click on <UNK> click on pages and close .
you can also move the details by simply dragging the grey title bar left or right .

"in <#> minutes , my sister and her boyfriend land at <UNK> ."
"our little , tiny apartment is going to be very crowded ."
"so , needless to say , i may not be writing as much as i would like ."
what a horrible way to start a blog ! !
i finished a book the other day that looks like it is going to be a huge hit .
i got an advanced copy of urllink jonathan strange and mr .
it 's a <UNK> novel and has the feel of the real thing .
it is the story of <#> <UNK> and how they bring magic back to england .
"the whole book is good , but the last <#> pages are amazing ."
definately work the time ( it 's a pretty <UNK> book ) and a must read for those cold winter months ...
urllink what movie do you belong <UNK> different <UNK> ! )
"while i 'm reading it , i ca n't help but think that he 's trying to convince me of something ."
everyone is just about as good as he or she can be .
even his step - father who beat his mother and shot at them ! !
he did n't really mean to hit them ... he would have never forgiven himself if he did
"because if my father had shot at us , i think we would have thought some bad things about him ."
even the kids who gave him shit at school are somehow good underneath it all .
i just get the feeling that it 's all so <UNK> .
... that 's not as bad as i thought .
only <#> books in my to - read pile .
i must have the most boring job in the world .
i created this blog so that i would actually have something to do at work besides spend my day reading everyone else 's blogs .
"so , here i am , at work and bored bored bored ."
"right now , i 'm finishing the third book in the his dark materials trilogy by <UNK> <UNK> , urllink the amber <UNK> ."
"it 's very well written , a great story but very dark ."
i ca n't believe that these books are for kids !
"some parts of it , particularly the parts regarding mary , remind me of mary <UNK> <UNK> 's book urllink the <UNK> ."
i found that book disturbing for some reason and i ca n't quite put my finger on it .
i 'm also reading bill clinton 's book .
"i know , i know , the hype ."
"i 'm ashamed to say that i got the book on the first day , but proud to say that i did n't wait in line for it ."
"so far , it reads like a novel or a book of short stories ."
he just <UNK> on and on with stories from his childhood .
"i 'm reading it thinking , what makes someone want to be president ?"
i always thought it was about power ... and it probably is .
"but , he was just a kid with a crappy childhood ."
lots of kids have crappy <UNK> and do n't want to become president .
"i have n't gotten very far yet , so maybe he explains it later on ."
"it ’s in my company , but in a different department ."
"i’m really trying not to get my hopes up , but i am thinking about it all the time ."
it has replaced quitting smoking in the area in my brain dedicated to obsessive thoughts .
"well , not replaced , but shoved over ."
i still <UNK> about both of <UNK> i haven’t even quit smoking yet .
"this medicine that i’m taking to quit , <UNK> , is keeping me up at night ."
"it ’s used as an anti - <UNK> , so i’ve been in a great mood the last couple of days , but i’m up until 1:30 am ."
"then i wake up , without any problem , at like 7:30 am ."
that goes against everything i have ever believed about sleep .
it ’s part of what makes me who i am .
it ’s the thing that my college friends tease me about .
it ’s the thing my husband says at dinner parties .
"i suppose it ’s good , especially if i’m not tired , to have more waking hours to get things done ."
but i can’t help feeling that it will eventually catch up with me .
"if my body needs <#> hours sleep a night , i need to get it , right ?"
"so now , ahead of me , i have a weekend of staying up late thinking about the job and how i 'm going to quit smoking ."
it seems like i shouldn’t have a problem with it .
"i only smoke about <#> - <#> cigarettes a day , but the problem is that i don’t really want to quit ."
"oh , a big part of me does , but there is a significant part of me that still loves it ."
"but , it ’s horrible for me and i keep having these mini panic attacks about cancer ."
"so , i’m going to list here the reasons i want to quit . <#> ."
my husband keeps asking me to quit and i know he does it because he loves me .
he keeps saying that he wants to live a long life with me and not have me die early because of cigarettes .
"<#> . cancer and other horrible , disgusting diseases ."
"<#> . in ny , you can’t smoke inside any building . not even in bars ."
"that makes <UNK> <UNK> , having to go <UNK> outside bars and restaurants ."
i don’t want to be <#> of those people .
my family doesn’t know i smoke and it would break their hearts if they knew i did . <#> .
i have noticed that i’ve been short of breath lately .
i don’t want to be like <UNK> still young . and
it will piss my boss off if i quit smoking because she smokes and wants a buddy to go downstairs with her .
"i want to have a baby in the next couple of years , so i’m going to have to quit anyway ."
better to get all that shit out of my system now .
i just hope that they hold up in the face of a massive <UNK> craving .
"i’m all set , i bought the gum ."
i went to the doctor and got a prescription for <UNK> .
"now , in <#> days , i’m going to start ."
"after you get the first sting , you 're addicted , so they say ."
"that 's good when the aching is deep , but the surface must remain <UNK> ."
ii : i guess that 's another extended pms .
only now i learned that i had to enable the due option to allow comments .
"i think i just did that , so feel free to comment on this post , the ones before and all the ones that follow ."
to get more like myself . been changing so fast for so long that i 'm <UNK> . guess i 'll never stop spinning .
"the only <UNK> thing in the universe is change itself , says the <UNK> ... there 's no such thing as eternal rest ."
"i hope i 'll get used to speaking out , that 's a good first step if i intend to sing out very shortly ."
i 'll take my time ( though it 's getting shorter by the hour ... ) ; maybe bring my songs in
... that 's all i can do for now .
it 's nothing but lost photographs people have found .
"believe me , it 's a lot more interesting , and sad , and <UNK> , than it sounds ."
"so , today i was in left hand , west virginia ."
"it 's a bit off the beaten path , but the people have great gardens and i mean everybody waved at me as i drove by ."
so i 'm driving and i see this strange little animal <UNK> down the road .
"it was n't a dog , but it was like a <UNK> <UNK> in that it was mostly feet and no legs ."
it was the <UNK> thing i think i 've ever seen .
"by the by , i think <UNK> pigs is a good name for a punk band ."
"also , the woman at the <UNK> gas and <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> that the <UNK> make the best cheese ."
i think it 's my responsibility to pass these things along .
"if you ever get to the <UNK> next to left hand , they have great burgers ."
the vast majority of people are friendly and mean .
they like to have a cup of coffee with you and know where your from and what your daddy does .
these same friendly people also think it would be fine to get rid of fill - in - the - blank group .
"<UNK> , drug <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , immigrants , jews ."
whatever group they do n't consider themselves to be in .
most people would wave and cheer at the box cars full of people as it left the station .
"the thing is , is that i 've been letting that slide ."
"somebody says something <UNK> and i think in my head , "" holy christ , what a <UNK> ! """
but i do n't say anything at all .
"i do n't want my <UNK> to say , "" here lies jill ."
"so listen , i 'll call you on your blind spots , and you call me on mine . deal ."

i have been feeling the <UNK> for the last few years and this last year has finally taken it 's toll on me .
"in my quest for <UNK> , i have found myself longing for new <UNK> grounds , different attitudes and changes in <UNK> ."
"i have always hated the fucking desert , and i wonder why i still keep coming back to it ."
i grew up in a <UNK> <UNK> of a town .
"left it to join the navy , spending <#> years on a desert island ."
now i spent the last <#> years watching my little city struggling to survive .
it 's kind of creepy how the environment changes the mentality of those living in it .
"i suppose there is a certain beauty in the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> of it all , but i just need a change of scenery ."
i suppose there will be things i will really miss .
my brother and his antics will be hard to replace .
"i have a little circle of friends , people who i enjoy spending time with when i can and the respect we share ."
"i suppose the biggest miss would probably be b. timing is everything , i guess ."
"no promises , no <UNK> expressed or <UNK> , names have been changed to protect the innocent ."
do not suck a <UNK> thing and not to be used as a food source .
"if you like what is here , let me know ."
"( like i would change it anyway , <UNK> ! )"
all the doors in my house are stuck in their frames and ginger has decided to play hide and seek with me by <UNK> herself in the garage .
i paid her back by repeatedly shaving her .
she paid me back by waking me up while i was trying to sleep today .
i paid her back by putting on her electrical collar .
"k and i get to talk today , i guess she needs closure ."
"t decided to stay with her guy , and i say <UNK> for her ! <#> less pain in my ass to deal with ."
still regret wasting the time i did on her .
what a waste of $ <#> in raw materials .
"<UNK> , do n't eat nothing till your face is ready to cave in , then eat just enough so it does n't ."
"i enjoyed my trips to oregon and texas and i have a date with b monday , and i want to fit in my <UNK> ."
that and the hunger fed <UNK> rush is better than coffee .
"i lie among the leaves , upon the forest floor ."
"<UNK> <UNK> of wood and <UNK> , singing wind and <UNK> sun ."
"the sun <UNK> not hurt <UNK> <UNK> in my hair , long and dark as sin ."
"i know not cold , or heat - but i know <UNK> warm earth <UNK> , living forest <UNK> ."
i lie ..... and wait for my calling .
beauty in life ... but in death ?
"yes , i think they are because <#> may walk in death yet be alive ."
"the spark that <UNK> within is not gone , but shines with a new <UNK> ."
perhaps a chance to embrace the darkness ... to balance it with the light .
"to truly know <UNK> , <#> must be willing to embrace all ."
"form <UNK> not , yet change is a constant ."
"i grow and <UNK> : only when i am willing to be all , but who am i ? ~ <UNK>"
and i lifted my hands under the weight of his <UNK> hair and felt his lips brush my cheek .
"and i stretch <UNK> on my toes , to <UNK> with him as <#> ."
"consuming , and being consumed by - hot and cold , darkness and light , no begining and no end - there is only us ."
"i am the night .... the night is in his eyes ... and now , in mine too ."
"the end of the dark tunnel of <UNK> , or ignorance is coming ."
"no creature shall be denied this enlightenment , or an opportunity to be part of the golden age which is coming ."
"all that is illusion and all that is <UNK> with the darkness is now revealed , as the light is <UNK> upon it ."
"the <UNK> are laid , and soon it will be time for the <UNK> to take their places ."
now is the time for those who have slept to <UNK> .
now is the time that the dead shall walk upon the earth and they shall interact with the living .
the ignorance of death shall be no more .
"the churches shall <UNK> , and the markets shall fall ."
that seed will take root and shall come to <UNK> .
"through chaos and destruction is founded unity , and through that unity there is peace ."
"time is short for those who would return to god , for those who would cast aside their <UNK> ."
"it is not that they will be punished , but rather , this reality shall not be supportive of them any longer ."
"these are the end times , but they are only the end of this time , not the end of all time ."
"it is the end of the cycle of <UNK> , and the begining of the cycle of <UNK> ."
"be prepared , this time is upon you ."
<UNK> is a term that has come to be more widely used in this time .
it is a term that means ' to raise above ' something . in terms of spiritual <UNK>
"everything is energy , and all energy <UNK> at a particular rate or speed ."
"the slower the rate , the lower the frequency , and the more ' <UNK> ' something appears to be ."
"reality exists on different band <UNK> , like a radio station or a website ."
"anything that <UNK> at a similar speed and frequency can be perceived in that reality , and can interact with it ."
cause and effect means that energy or <UNK> can be changed by changing the nature of the object or by the actions of that object .
"your body <UNK> at a fairly slow rate , and therefore the frequency is that which has come to be known as the ' physical ' realm ."
"you are capable of changing your <UNK> rate at will , and it is affected by the changes in your spiritual growth ."
"the higher the frequency , the less <UNK> the object ."
"<UNK> , broken down into their smallest form , would look like <UNK> of <UNK> ( <UNK> base to base ) all <UNK> ."
"there is a ' force ' which <UNK> these elements together , to form mass ."
the mass is formed according to a divine <UNK> .
that is the plan for all life that began in god 's imagination .
"ok , that is the physics lesson . still with me ?"
<UNK> is the process by which you are able to ' rise above ' your limitations .
to go beyond what has limited you in your existence .
"it is a sense of being <#> with all things , of knowing where you 've been and where you are , and understanding fully how you got there ."
it is knowing yourself to be <#> with god .
"it is knowing without a doubt , that all things are possible because you have the power to imagine and make <UNK> ."
it is a <UNK> of all the ' seperate ' aspects of yourself which were previously <UNK> .
"it is an <UNK> of you - all that you are , in total love , and an <UNK> with love of every other thing in existence ."
are you limited to which band <UNK> you can exist on ?
why is it that you think you can not walk on water ?
"your programming - from childhood , past lives , schools , religions , society ."
what you believe about yourself and your own capabilities .
self love - or lack of . allowing your physical form to become the expression for all your fears and blocks and becoming dis - <UNK> .
your beliefs select the reality you perceive and also the reality you experience .
do you have a genetic <UNK> to <UNK> and dying by a certain time ?
there is an older <UNK> in your soul which carries a divine plan for what you were created to be .
all you have to do is become it .
you are discovering this with your <UNK> into the <UNK> of spirit .
you know that the core essence of you can not die .
"only the slower <UNK> mass - the body , returns to the energy from <UNK> it came ."
the only way to ' cease to exist ' is by <UNK> god .
"by <UNK> with all that is , and then that is not really <UNK> ."
"it is possible , with you will , your absolute faith , and your <UNK> all <UNK> , that you can raise your body 's <UNK> into light ."
"not to seperate from it through the process you knew as death , but to bring it with you into the light ."
because you are not limited by the physical and never have been .
"when you begin a journey into self exploration , and spiritual awareness , you are <UNK> a truth that is <UNK> into your very cells ."
it is part of the divine <UNK> which you are designed to be .
"when you discover things about this truth , a light goes on inside you ."
"your mind opens to new possibilities , and the reality you perceive changes ."
"with each discovery of this truth , your <UNK> goes up ."
"you can still perceive and even interact with the third and fourth <UNK> as you were doing , but you can also perceive higher <UNK> of reality too ."
"when you feel and express love and compassion , your <UNK> goes up , you begin to fill with light , and that light channels through your being ."
"this is because when you do this , you are begining to recognize and fulfill your divine <UNK> ."
you are feeling and expressing things that god feels and <UNK> .
"<UNK> , you are god 's eyes , ears and hands ."
"through you , god knows himself , and can grow ."
"i am reading william james ' ' principles of psychology ' , written in the <UNK> and thoroughly relevant to many debates about the relation between mind and body ."
it is refreshing to observe the way he <UNK> <UNK> with the kind of <UNK> to personal development <#> might expect to find in popular psychology titles .
he suggests that <#> should do at least <#> thing every day simply because you do n't want to .
"today i spent an hour beginning to <UNK> my study , with a <UNK> <UNK> effect on my mood and self esteem ."
"i am , as perhaps are most of us , struggling with <UNK> my values with my behaviour ."
"i am writing this far too late in the night , for example ."
"this blog will be to some extent a personal <UNK> , although i aim to keep it positive and solution <UNK> ."
"i will record the basics such as when i go to bed , rise , and whether i have achieved some of the basic <UNK> goals ."
there are a whole load of things that i am not happy about in my current everyday life .
"the first <UNK> i have for the next week or <#> are to be regular about my bedtime and rising , my exercise , and my core goals ."
i will go into more detail as i progress .
"right now i am going to go to bed , much too late , and get too little sleep , and hope to make the most of tomorrow nonetheless ."
"the hope is that by ' going public ' with my goals , i will <UNK> social pressure as well as my own self - <UNK> ."
"ok , this is my first ever blog entry , something of an experiment ."
"my reason for starting this is to give me somewhere to tell the world what i am reading , thinking , wondering at and about ."
perhaps i will make contact with occasional like - minded people .
long relaxed conversations with good friends are much to be <UNK> .
a friend of mine was testing the <UNK> of my views on religion over a good meal .
basically i was <UNK> that a person would have a more meaningful life as a urllink <UNK> than as a christian .
your neighbour whose faith helped him not to <UNK> when his wife died ?
surely i could n't be suggesting that all those people would be better off without the beliefs that give their lives purpose ?
the <UNK> is that particular individuals would n't find purpose without their religious beliefs .
does n't the <UNK> of religion leave a god - shaped gap in your life that nothing else can fill ?
"sorry , but i do n't think so ."
"for many , the beliefs they considered essential to their happiness can <UNK> like an old <UNK> <UNK> to a halt on the steep hills of life 's road ."
<UNK> urllink robin <UNK> christianity does not mean <UNK> <UNK> .
"it is <#> of the frustrations of being a <UNK> urllink bright , that we do n't fit very well into the otherwise religious categories ."
our presence is given a nod in the ugly phrase ' of all religions and none ' .
so how are these people to be represented when <UNK> and others wish to <UNK> ?
the <UNK> urllink daniel <UNK> <UNK> urllink commented that <UNK> <UNK> is like trying to herd cats .
"in the public arena , i think we can work with the word ' belief ' if not ' faith ' ."
in fact i would go as far as to say that we therefore must be ' believers ' .
i must say that even in this <UNK> mood i find it hard to say that i am part of a ' faith - community ' .
"i will not for the moment push the idea that we have ' faith ' , as the word so often means believing in the face of contrary evidence ."
i wonder if a good approach to explaining <UNK> is that the difference in our beliefs is where we get them from .
"is n't this the crucial , central question , from which all others <UNK> ?"
it is a great encouragement to meet people with a similar history .
in the past few weeks i have had occasion to meet some lovely people and have had a rather similar conversation with them all .
"the person will have started adult life with very clear views about what the truth is ( as with me , it was urllink <UNK> christianity ."
the annoying thing is that my dad always said this would eventually happen to me - that i would mellow in my <UNK> .
"<#> of these people had simply got older and wiser , another had lost an adult child , another 's marriage broke down ."
i wonder if it is generally the case that people mellow as they mature .
"of course for some people ( including me now ) , <UNK> requires <UNK> by definition ."
"many of these people have moved from <UNK> faith to a <UNK> , more <UNK> faith ."
i was much relieved and encouraged to find that their <UNK> 's progress had been at least in a similar direction to mine .
this conversation raised the issue of the values shared by liberal christians and secular <UNK> .
in both cases the agenda is ' this - <UNK> ' and reason is highly <UNK> .
i must say i have found that some of the <UNK> in some <UNK> discussion lists is <UNK> negative about liberal christians .
"it seems that believers of all types are easily <UNK> in together , as if there is anything much in common between a liberal and an <UNK> christian ."
urllink ' think ' by simon <UNK> is part of my preparation for some teaching on philosophy of mind .
"despite too little sleep last night , i understood some of it ."
it was mainly about <UNK> and theories of knowledge .
he <UNK> this section by <UNK> <#> main approaches in urllink <UNK> .
now that last <#> would be a good <#> to keep in store for those exams children !
i have recently joined the urllink national secular society and the urllink british <UNK> association .
urllink the <UNK> is a less formal initiative along these lines .
i feel a little uncomfortable with the possible interpretation that people with a <UNK> world - view are obviously bright - er than those with a different position .
still i will probably go along with the term as i do think there is a need for <#> .
"happily , it was a very good friend of mine ."
i broke my journey at his home and we ( as always ) had a wonderfully <UNK> conversation about the above paragraph .
yet he and i were <UNK> <UNK> that there is an instinct in humans towards some sort of ritual and <UNK> of a sense of <UNK> etc .
i think that a basic understanding and appreciation of evolution is a cause of utter wonder ( <UNK> <UNK> ' urllink ' <UNK> the rainbow ' .
"if not , why do so many have it - <UNK> ?"
"if i should , what should a <UNK> do with the desire ?"
my best answer so far is to worship money sex and power .
"only joking , although soooo many would love me to say this as they consider it the only alternative to worship of their concept of god ."
early in may i was driving in southern indiana and the <UNK> was in full bloom .
so i had the windows open in my vehicle .
i was thoroughly enjoying the weather and the sweet smell of <UNK> .
a week later the <UNK> was in full bloom here in michigan and again i had the occasion to drive with the windows open and enjoy the <UNK> .
that is a smell that will <UNK> even the worst mood i might have .
remember how you feel when you smell it ?
it just makes you feel good all over .
you feel such delight ! have you got it ?
now keep thinking about that as you read the following scripture .
this is from <UNK> <UNK> - <#> ( <UNK> ) a shoot will come up from the <UNK> of jesse ; from his roots a branch will bear fruit .
did you see how what you’re thinking about fit with this scripture ?
it says that jesus will delight in the fear of the lord .
when it came to doing god ’s will jesus had the feeling of delight .
"in fact the hebrew word here is talking about the enjoyment of smell , just like you’re thinking about right now ."
this was <UNK> attitude towards <UNK> god and doing his will .
let ’s have this same attitude as we worship god and do his will .
half - through the week if <#> is a <#> - <UNK> i am right now .
the while wishing i were a downtown <UNK> <UNK> or something of the like .
i just want to be among the elements of the world rather than <UNK> from a <UNK> window view of a <UNK> building downtown .
it makes very little sense to me why i ever even became an office <UNK> should have been a <UNK> .
"there is and are , however , more status and better benefits ( i’m just guessing on the benefits <UNK> a <UNK> ."
i suppose i did take <UNK> into consideration when i decided what his mom would do for a living until he graduates from high school .
<UNK> a terrible lesson that was for me to teach him .
"well assuming , of course , that he would not enjoy an office job ."
that is really what a job is to most people .
"let ’s see here , what can i do to make enough money to pay my way in a world i have created for myself ?"
that ’s a <UNK> up way to decide on stuff .
i have been doing a great deal of thinking about burning man .
i am very excited about my journey to the man .
"i have begun my journey , but i think i mentioned that in a former blog"
being aware of what i feed my body and aware of what my body needs .
very basic stuff that is so easily forgotten .
"<UNK> , i’d like not to eat <UNK> or pre - prepared <UNK> as restaurant or fast - foods ."
i could still eat “ out ” it would just be from a friend ’s kitchen rather than a business .
"not for the same reasons other people need <UNK> know , to buy things , <UNK> need money for a pile ."
all i need is a little pile of money . and
only because there are a few things in this world that you can only get with money .
i just thought of <UNK> of led to that conclusion but <UNK> take it !
i do surprise myself with my thoughts from time to time .
its like a bonus for being <UNK> having to hang out with me all day .
gracious everyday life is rather <UNK> people mostly .
i have been thinking a great deal of <UNK> from the 7th <UNK> begin trying to be like “ everyone ”
“ the <UNK> or better than the “ <UNK> ” i’ll <UNK> at great expenses to do so .
it is a vicious <UNK> like the violence - cycle or uni - <UNK> kidding about the <UNK> .
just trying to <UNK> up my thoughts there .
i was typing that is <UNK> people begin in the 7th grade or so ( usually ) trying to be like “
each other ” all the while losing <UNK> they realize what they did and begin looking for themselves <UNK> age for most ) .
"gracious , most people never admit they lost themselves ."
i just spoke with my <UNK> and was suddenly <UNK> into reality .
is n't it curious how mom 's can be going along seemingly in control and bam !
<UNK> me lady -- your son is grown !
"no , what had happened was ... actually , no joke ."
i was talking to <UNK> on the phone about “
and i am not quite sure what he said but it occurred to me <UNK> !
he’d rather be in <UNK> with his friends and his truck and stuff than in houston with none of that !
what i am feeling is just <#> of those little shifts in a relationship where <#> person grows and the other doesn’t .
i’m not supposed to grow that <UNK> not supposed to realize that my baby boy is nearly a grown man !
i don’t realize it because he will always be my baby and should be .
it ’s what is nearly the most important feeling of all as a <UNK> you remember ?
well if you <UNK> but it ’s true nonetheless .
"anyway , i do wonder if my mom realizes it ."
he is her life in so many <UNK> breath some days .
i wonder if she knows that i know that ?
she gave me a saying the other day to <UNK> for her .
"it states as follows : “ life is not measured by the number of <UNK> we take , but by the moments that take our breath away ."
” she is such a cool mom .
i have a cute card at home i can write a nice message in .
"i’m going to new orleans this weekend with my sister , <UNK> ."
"we will stay with a friend , kenny ."
he ’s definitely the <UNK> with the <UNK> !
i’ll have to post some pictures when i return .
i don’t appreciate live music <UNK> someday hope to .
"unless of course , i learn to appreciate the good , live music ."
"anyway , our plan is go to go <UNK> for gambling or <UNK> , ms for the beaches ."
"again , i’ll post pictures if i can ."
btw : my <UNK> is the best kid in the world !
"if you wanna check him out , you can at <UNK>"
great job on the commitment to no alcohol .
i worked on <UNK> 's piece and its turning out greater than i anticipated .
i figure i can give myself this week ( before friday ) to have it complete and ready to ship or take to her .
i have had a lot of tea tonight and need a sleeping pill to counter the <UNK> .
i already miss my <UNK> and he just left yesterday .
burning man is my focus ... and all the <UNK> experiences that come with it .
good night you ... and fun dreams to ya .
i typed an entry and somehow <UNK> without publishing it .
i 'm realizing i am much different than i once thought .
i feel like my life is fitting together .
"oh ... that reminds me , i bought the perfect shoes to wear when i ride <UNK> ."
i have decided to plan and work towards my first experience of burning man .
"i am going this year and am very , very anxious ."
i sure hope to have <UNK> ready for the trip .
she has been such a good van so far .
i can hardly wait to camp in her .
"grilled chicken , <UNK> potatoes , frozen <UNK> , <UNK> tomatoes , olive oil , onion , garlic , pepper and salt ."
i call it my greek - esque dish .
i need to wash my clothes tonight but i forgot to buy <UNK> at the grocery store .
i was trying so hard to stay focused and to get only what i need for the week and to not go <UNK> .... !
"with my strength , i was able to walk out of that store without purchasing a single case of anything that was on sale ."
"<UNK> at the grocery store is not <UNK> . and besides , i do think its the <UNK> lights that cause it -- the <UNK> that is ."
i have a piece to work on for my best friend 's <UNK> wedding anniversary .
"well , this is my second day of working on this journal ."
i 'm still getting the feel of the process ; and i do n't know if it will work for me yet .
"but i 'm curious , and i want jon to try it out ."
which he wo n't do if he does n't know what to expect . which he wo n't know if i do n't figure it out
"i keep thinking of extra things to add to my profile , the format used was a little <UNK> ."
"for example , it 's easier for me to mention favorite authors than it is to mention favorite books ."
my interests are not really as <UNK> as i like to read .
"it 's got a lot more to do with "" read exactly what ? """
"i 'm not sharing what i 'm doing with my "" <UNK> "" at work ."
i 'm afraid they would find me and read me .
"my quasi "" goth "" <UNK> assistant would get a kick out of the whole thing though ."
"okay , that 's it for random thoughts tonight ."
it 's more about the process than the product at this point .
"the first time i tried this , it did n't work out very well ."
"that 's what happens when a quasi "" <UNK> "" tries to use a new technology ."
but i 'm determined to master this <#> way or another .
"i just finished <UNK> , written by <UNK> <UNK> ."
"very good book , although i must say that it left me with a lot of <UNK> questions ."
"the main character , <UNK> , is the voice and main character throughout the book ."
"in a very large <UNK> , <UNK> takes us through <UNK> painful <UNK> , teen years , college , and eventually places him in the first great world war ."
<UNK> has many psychological <UNK> as he tries to understand the meaning of life .
this is n't helped as he runs into a nasty bully ( whose name <UNK> me ) who nearly makes him his slave .
"we are then introduced to a max <UNK> , an intellectual even in his <UNK> years ."
"max sees "" the mark "" in <UNK> and decides to take him on as a friend ."
"max <UNK> deals with the bully situation , and the <#> ( <UNK> and max ) are <UNK> connected for life ."
"max makes a series of <UNK> throughout the novel , yet never leaves the mind of <UNK> ."
"at it 's <UNK> , <UNK> and max meet pre war , have many <UNK> <UNK> conversations on the meaning and life and the cows of humanity ."
"<UNK> meets eva , max 's mother , and falls deeply in love ( could n't get more <UNK> then this ) ."
"their love is never physically <UNK> , and max and <UNK> are both sent off to the war ."
"in its end , <UNK> meets max in a hospital , yet whether it was real or imagined <UNK> me ."
"max kisses <UNK> , claiming that it was a kiss from eva ."
"<UNK> passes out , <UNK> , and max is gone ."
"surely a poor reading on my part , in particular that i did not put down the questions that concerned me as i referred to in the beginning ."
"especially i am thrown by "" the mark "" that max , <UNK> , and eva share ."
"i can only assume that this is some sort of <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> idea ."
"but , as i think more on it , i just might come back and post ."
i 'll think on this and post my thoughts tomorrow .
what a long day it has been already .
"the mini - van just got out of the shop and the transmission light is already back on , figures ."
i guess it is better for it break down before we go on vacation .
the pool is cloudy today the dog needs a bath .
seems like satan does what he can to keep our minds so occupied with stress that we forget to pray or spend any time with god .
i have decided not to worry about the van or the cloudy pool .
( i think the pool is the least of my problems . )
i am just going to sit and watch god deal with the problem he certainly was not surprised when that light came on so why should i be ?
"we are trying to make some changes at church and move our church into , at least , the last century ."
i have heard it said that our society is modern and <UNK> but when you walk into the doors of most churches they are <#> years behind the times .
"a lost world is not interested in our beautiful stain glass windows or the color of our <UNK> , they are looking for soul food and we have it ."
how in the world are we going to get them into the door if they do n't recognize the place when they walk in ?
we have become a <UNK> society why should the church be any different ?
does that mean we change the message of the bible ?
heaven forbid ; but can the church be flexible and change with the culture in which they function ? absolutely ! ! !
i wish that our church would be more concerned with what is outside our doors than what is inside them .
"well , i guess we will pray for them and for our community , with god nothing is impossible not fixing the van or stretching our church ."
"wow , what a crazy idea , write your thoughts on the web for the whole world to read ."
not that the whole world is interested in what a <UNK> living in s. illinois has on her mind but nevertheless here i am .
i am not sure what to say so i will start with what is on my mind which turns out to be very little .
"our family just returned from a week in n. carolina , much <UNK> than s. illinois , by the way ."
we had a great week and it was nice to be in the mountains with just my husband and <#> kids .
"no <UNK> , no phone , no cartoon network ."
my husband serves as a minister of a church here and although it was nice to get away
i am glad it is still nice to come home and see our friends at church .
it seems we can never please everyone but in general it is a kind church .
we were very surprised and overwhelmed to discover that <UNK> on our <UNK> had been taken care of by some of the church members while we were away .
not that i want to move but at times it seems like a good idea .
"working at a large , <UNK> company is sometimes difficult ."
it would be extremely tough to be a <UNK> in this company because it is hard to find the correct resources .
lay on top of that the struggle for revenue and sales credit on every deal and it leads to a tough <UNK> to accomplish results .
i 'm on this call right now in which <#> organizations are fighting over revenue and <UNK> their place on a sales in which i was <UNK> in closing .
"then we would hear "" let 's win <#> for the team "" ."
when a guy that has been at the company for <#> months is providing direction to a team that average <#> years that could be an issue .
"that is to say direction on process , approach ... versus simply vision and leadership ."
that 's it for now ... not completely clear .
<UNK> a.m. went for a nice ride on the mountain bike .
"i thought about a lot of things ... how i should n't be so rough on my daughter , <UNK> ."
it seems as if she 's struggling to figure out who she 's is .
it 's tough some times . <UNK> with work .
"significant discussion with the delivery and <UNK> team today , but i 'm not sure what to tell them ."
the group needs a serious <UNK> speech -- <UNK> is really down .
they 've been beaten up quite a bit in the past <#> months .
"well , it is off for the shower and a strong day at work ."
i wish i could get the damn <UNK> login to work properly .
"that 's part of the problem with working in such a large company , the support is b - r - u - t - a - l ."
i do n't know how many people i hear about that have problems with computers for days and weeks at a time .
"watching the end of the today show ... <UNK> my work email , but not <UNK> working today ."
i 've pretty much checked out for the july 4th holiday .
"i have a few things to do this week , but not a whole lot ."
"i could find lots of work to do , but without them having <UNK> , i 'm not too motivated . yesterday"
", the <UNK> <UNK> were supposed to come put in new <UNK> in my bathrooms ."
"they are supposed to be here today , but it 's almost 10:00 am and they are still not here ."
i 'll give them till <UNK> before i call the company and see where they are .
"i think they had to swing by home depot to pick up the supplies first , so i 'll give them a little <UNK> ."
i 'm headed to the pacific <UNK> on thursday night for some vacation .
"<#> nights in seattle , then <#> in vancouver , then <#> back in seattle before flying back home to dallas ."
"i 'll spend some time in the city , but plan on getting out into the surrounding country as much as i can too ."
"i intend on exploring they olympic <UNK> , mt . <UNK> area , victoria , and a few other places ."
plus a little city <UNK> to <UNK> my attention some .
i 've heard about blogs quite a bit and finally decided to test the waters of putting <#> together .
i 'll be curious to see if this changes my life any .
i 'm sitting in my recently - painted tv room watching some show about ancient man - made things found off the island of <UNK> .
"i 'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now , but not really <UNK> what is going on in them ."
"but if someone wants to chat me , that 's cool ."
"the tv room is now ruby red . or as a friend of mine called it -- "" ho red "" ."
it took <#> coat of <UNK> and <#> <UNK> of the red .
"there is still minor color <UNK> , but you ca n't really see it that much ."
i 'm <UNK> the only <#> that would notice them .
i went to the gym yesterday expecting them to have me taking all kinds of stress tests etc .
i was actually disappointed when that did n't happen because i was soooo <UNK> for it .
but omg ... a few hours caffeine free had an affect on me i was n't expecting .
"my hands were <UNK> , i was <UNK> and nervous , and at <#> point burst into tears , all due to lack of caffeine ."
i wonder if this is how an addict feels waiting for a fix .
ironically thanks to the <UNK> patch i did n't go through this when i quit smoking in january .
maybe later this year ( <#> certainly has been a year of changes for me so far ! )
i am going on my first date in <#> years this afternoon .
does <#> wear the <UNK> and evening gown at tim <UNK> 's at <#> in the afternoon ?
"but i ca nt , i have done that to this poor guy twice already ."
"it 's time to shit or get off of the pot , as they say ."
either that or my mid - life crisis has hit early .
i am actually kinda excited about it all . )
i go this morning to the gym for my fitness test .
i am not even there yet and already they have started their torture .
part of the pre - test condition is no caffeine for <#> hours prior to the test .
omg you people are a bunch of <UNK> - <UNK> !
i 'd sell my soul right now for an extra large tim <UNK> .
the boy - for whom this whole gym <UNK> was started - goes for his test later this afternoon .
he seems pretty keen himself ... and is n't too upset about the idea of his mom joining too .
"ahhhh , a bonding moment for mother and son ."
"i do n't have daughters , but i am quite sure they have n't changed much since my own teenage years ."
i am curious to know who 's face <UNK> the wall 's of canada 's teen <UNK> these days however .
pop poster <UNK> that <UNK> girls <UNK> over - have things really changed that much in <#> years ?
my bedroom wall <UNK> <#> was <UNK> by john <UNK> .
grease was the teen movie we all grew up loving .
"and the double album movie soundtrack was the teen album ( yes <UNK> , stop rolling your eyes ) that we played until we knew every word by heart ."
"( <UNK> , the <UNK> and chest thing must have started earlier for me than i previously realized ) ."
the next major heart - <UNK> that i can recall <UNK> my <UNK> walk walls was greg <UNK> .
"he was the star of an american tv show we had started getting from the us called "" <UNK> and the bear "" ."
he had a jaw line that was just like omg !
my fascination with him went beyond posters and also included magazine articles etc .
"now we slide into my "" this is as close as i got to ' punk ' era "" <UNK> <#> - <#> ."
king of my wild <UNK> for sure - adam ant aka stewart <UNK> .
only thing physically i can say about adam as my poster boy is he had beautiful <UNK> and eyes that pierced . finally ...
my last poster boy - the man who 's face finally came off my walls when i got married at age <#> .
martin <UNK> from <UNK> ballet <UNK> <#> - <#> .
it was definitely the eyes and the <UNK> chin that left me weak at the knees over martin .
he apparently in later years - <UNK> to me - went on to become a tv soap star on <UNK> in the uk .
another reason i should have stayed in the uk !
"today at age <UNK> , my walls , dresser and night - tables are host to another whole new selection of "" poster boys "" ."
<UNK> my <UNK> calendar - it was for charity .... honest !
"from infant to drum major and petty officer second class , i have enough photos of this young man to <UNK> the <UNK> chapel if required ."
"it 's because of him , i am the person i am today ."
i like to think that that is a good thing .
"i have n't talked about her much so far , either in real life or online ."
i think sometime this weekend i will take the time to sit and put some thoughts together on her . and finally dad .
"his first anniversary is fast approaching , so i will save my thoughts on him until that day ."
and you thought poster boys were just pretty faces torn out of a teen magazine ....
"for me it 's always been about the eyes , the chin , the <UNK> and the chest ."
"yes , i am sure someone will make a <UNK> comment !"
"urllink adam ant - not my typical poster boy , but he was <UNK> ."
urllink martin <UNK> - my last poster boy - and my favourite .
"i keep in quasi - regular touch with my ex - boyfriend "" <UNK> "" ( he of the frozen peas love letter ) via email ."
this from the commitment - <UNK> who lived with me for <#> years and avoided any mention of marriage after the first year .
"naturally i was struck by the "" harry met sally "" <UNK> of my life yet again ."
""" it was n't that he did n't want to get married , it was that he did n't want to get married to me . """
i must confess a certain amount of self - satisfied <UNK> when he mentioned earlier this year that they had divorced .
"even though in the <#> years since we split up and we never <UNK> <UNK> , i still have a soft spot for my <UNK> - <UNK> dj ."
so i was <UNK> when i received another <#> of his email <UNK> this morning .
he has decided he has had enough of being <UNK> and he is moving home to britain .
he however has n't been back to his small scottish village since he <UNK> here as a pre - teen <#> years ago .
"i am sure no amount of "" <UNK> street "" or "" keeping up appearances "" will prepare him for the culture shock ."
"the ability to just pack up and leave , no ties , no <UNK> , no responsibilities ."
naturally i wished him well ... and asked what he was doing with his computer .
ok today i have decided to set this up .
"i have been looking around at quite a few other blogs , posting the odd comment and reading lots of funny and entertaining stories ."
it is difficult to explain why i am laughing at my desk though when the odd person walks by .
"some of this stuff , on the other blogs is just plain nasty ."
but strangely enough this is what i find the most funny .
"i haven’t said much , but i have a meeting until <#> tonight and i will try to update this more later ."
"ok the title ’s a little <UNK> , but in the end you see where it ’s from ."
"but anyway i’ll begin at the beginning , a good a place as any ."
"a fully <UNK> , large , solar heated , salt water , in ground <UNK> <UNK> ."
i have no skill and very little interest in <UNK> any for the sake of pool maintenance .
"my step dad told me that it ’s pretty easy and started in on a <UNK> , blah , blah ."
"yeah , i hear what you’re saying but i think i’ll just get someone to maintain it for me , and then i don’t have to worry ."
i call to arrange for someone to come to maintain it .
"so i get the yes we’ll come out and take a look , ok the address , yep , ok and now onto business ."
“ how often do i want it cleaned ?
"oh , i have a choice , weekly , <UNK> or monthly ” ."
<UNK> “ $ <#> each time you come out and extra for chemicals ? ”
", i am by now <UNK> the pool maintenance for <UNK> speech i got from my step dad , boy i should have written some of that down ."
<UNK> is actually a woman – so much for the fantasies !
but the pool was always clean and <UNK> and good to swim in .
"it is now winter and in my opinion too cold to swim , so i haven’t been swimming for a few months now ."
"yes they still have the pump , yes they have spoken to the owner"
", yes , he said it is fine for them to fix it , yes , yes , <UNK> but why is it still not fixed ?"
"oh my god , this is awesome , love you <UNK> ” without at least having practiced it a few times ."
so this christmas my mum told me she was buying me a pot .
"( no not pot , a pot ) ."
"” “ yes , a pot it is a good <#> , it costs a fortune and that ’s what you’re getting ."
a pot ? ” “ yes a pot .
"so why not just put coal in my <UNK> and be done with it , ma . ”"
"“ stop you’re <UNK> , you’ll thank me in the long run ” “"
"for background we always open our presents christmas eve and have christmas dinner after this ,"
mum says it so she doesn’t have to do anything ( cooking and the like ) on christmas day .
"as i may have mentioned i do not like seafood , at all , <UNK> at a push ( the poop shoot must always be removed , always ) ."
but still i am not a big fan .
"the closer it gets to meal time , it begins to dawn on me that this is it . “"
"ma , we’re not having lobster are we ? ”"
"” she laughs at me , laughs ! by this time"
"i think that this is definitely it , but denial is still there trying to convince me otherwise . “"
after about <#> minutes trying to decide what <UNK> of <UNK> soup i am going to have i spot a can of baked beans . “
i am going to have baked beans for my christmas dinner .
” she starts laughing at me again .
where is the christmas tradition in my family ?
how can i have a great christmas eating baked beans on toast for my dinner ?
"i would have turned into a <UNK> , rather than be warm and as far as rain was concerned , you could have <UNK> me out some days ."
so why is this a continuing trend for the young throughout the ages ?
"i think i have about <#> or <#> now ) , but alas , still no <UNK> – that <UNK> <UNK> just hangs on for some of us ."
but this is more than enough to remain warm ( and mostly dry ) .
"<UNK> , i am supposed to be an adult woman now , right ?"
"don’t have brothers , you are missing out ! !"
i guess the main deciding factor is they keep me warm and that ’s more important to me now .
"<UNK> in <UNK> , maybe the first girl just didn’t know , but i’ll pass on the furry <UNK> ."
so what am i <UNK> on about today ?
i have knee high ones ) a pair of track pants –
.... give me my coat i’m going out .
"by the way , the title does n't really fit with the story but i like it and it 's going to stay ."
i got this from this urllink blog when i was cruising around the web yesterday .
"find out who you truly are .... in a negative sense , that is ."
"urllink <UNK> ( ram ) born march <#> - april <#> aggressive to the extreme , the <UNK> is <UNK> - <UNK> and cruel ."
"not the <UNK> tool in the shed , he often has trouble remembering the <UNK> of things ."
"the <UNK> will often try to <UNK> his peers , but luckily , he usually lacks the mental capacity to succeed ."
"he is <UNK> and blunt , and incapable of <UNK> ."
"he is <UNK> dull in a conversation , mostly due to an annoying tendency to ramble on for hours about himself , completely oblivious to those around him ."
"when drunk , an <UNK> will usually become <UNK> and violent , often making a scene ."
to find out your ( not so good ) character traits click urllink here .
i’m sure you’ve all heard of the “ what colour was the bear ” puzzle .
so here is something a little harder for you .
this has always been <#> of my <UNK> .
the names have not been changed to save the innocent .
"here goes : jack and jill are found lying on the floor dead , they are surrounded by pools of water and broken glass ."
oh and the most exciting thing to happen to me today ?
"i got lost looking for a <UNK> office , although i did stop and ask for directions ( twice ! ) ."
the comments were already there and are not from me .
"if you yelled for <#> years , <#> months and <#> days you would have produced enough sound energy to heat <#> cup of coffee ."
"if you <UNK> consistently for <#> years and <#> months , enough gas is produced to create the energy of an <UNK> bomb ."
( now that 's more like it ! )
the human heart creates enough pressure when it <UNK> out to the body to <UNK> blood <#> feet .
"( in my next life , i want to be a pig . )"
a <UNK> will live <#> days without its head before it <UNK> to death .
( creepy ... i'm still not over the pig . )
banging your head against a wall uses <#> calories an hour .
( do not try this at home.. .... maybe at work . )
the male praying <UNK> can not <UNK> while its head is attached to its body .
the female <UNK> sex by ripping the male 's head off .
""" ) the <UNK> can jump <#> times its body length ."
it 's like a human jumping the length of a football field .
( <#> minutes ... lucky pig ... can you imagine ? ? )
( what could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond ? ) some <UNK> mate over <#> times a day .
( i still want to be a pig in my next life ... quality over <UNK> ) butterflies taste with their feet .
( something i always wanted to know . )
"right - handed people live , on average , <#> years longer than left - handed people ."
"( if you 're <UNK> , do you split the difference ? )"
<UNK> are the only animals that can not jump .
"( ok , so that would be a good thing .... )"
a cat 's urine <UNK> under a black light .
( i wonder who was paid to figure that out ? ) an <UNK> 's eye is bigger than its brain .
( i know some people like that . )
( i know some people like that too . )
"( if they switch , they 'll live a lot longer . )"
humans and <UNK> are the only species that have sex for pleasure .
"so it ’s raining today ( as it was yesterday , and the day before , and the day before and even the day before that –"
so what exciting <UNK> have i gotten up to over the weekend ?
he spent literally hours trying to rip the ribs from the spine
so the most exciting thing to happen today ?
but let me tell you of the story of how it got there to start with .
"so about a <UNK> ago i parked my car under a <UNK> tree down there , in the shade , you know ."
"these fuckers always hang around in the trees here , the australian <UNK> <UNK> trees that is ) , they eat the nuts in them you see ."
i blame these birds entirely for the rest of this story .
"so i go to get in my car in the semi dark , as usual ."
i’m driving along ( as usual ) and i look toward the passenger side of the <UNK> .
"i can see a <UNK> looking patch on the window , but i am not too sure of what this is at this stage and think –"
well it may have been if i had any water in the <UNK> <UNK> things ( i have no idea of the real name of these ) .
so i hit the water <UNK> <UNK> and what happens ?
i was like someone had thrown a bucket of white paint across the <UNK> .
"i couldn’t see shit ( yeah , i get the pun ) ."
so here i am <UNK> through the <UNK> <UNK> trying to make my way along the road .
the worst of it is i don’t have a tap ( that i can turn on –
"i think i must have parked my car under some community branch for the birds , or at least their public toilet ."
so now i always look up when i park .
"no tree , that ’s the spot for me !"
"loving you is a <UNK> of a lifetime of hopes , dreams , <UNK> , goals , etc ."
there are so many <UNK> moments that we have shared over the years that sometimes it <UNK> me to think of how much we have been blessed .
but we both know that along the way somewhere i’ve become lost .
emotionally i’ve become more and more unable connect to the experiences of my life .
physically i’ve become anxious and <UNK> to illness .
the <UNK> of our relationship has suffered as has my ability to express love to you and the boys .
over a long period of time and specifically at critical moments in time i’ve lost hope .
lost it to the point that life has often felt almost unbearable and the <UNK> of death has <UNK> <UNK> close to me .
i’d do almost anything to avoid this process .
the result is that i’m not able to be the man that i’ve <UNK> to be all my life .
not the man that you imagine me to be .
"<#> is the man that lives deep inside of me ; the <#> i’ve never wanted to be , but the <#> i face in the mirror every morning ."
at this point i’ve not really come to <UNK> with how i’ve gotten here – but the reality is i’m here and you are here with me .
"but it is crystal clear to me that i’ve got to deal with these issues to be whole , and i need your help ."
"i’ve now reached the point that i’m able to admit that his can not be done alone , in darkness , but must openly exposed to the light ."
from the time i was a small child i’ve been a complicated <UNK> of <UNK> .
"it has always been so important to me , even as young as <#> , that i do the right thing and be responsible ."
"but at the same time there has been this deep , powerful , painful internal conflict between what i’ve wanted to do and how i feel about my sexuality ."
every single day is a struggle with the guilt and shame of my physical attraction to men .
my primary desire to work through this with you and restore myself to the person i’m meant to be .
", i would do anything to make that happen ."
i will probably go and workout this evening after work and before picking dennis up from the train station .
i think it 'll be just <UNK> because i 've lifted twice this week .
i think i 'll do upper body again tomorrow .
<UNK> tomorrow morning and weights and <UNK> in the evening .
i need to go get ready for this mornings ' <UNK> ya !
"i went to the gym after work , walked ten minutes on the treadmill to <UNK> ."
"i did smith <UNK> , smith <UNK> and smith <UNK> raises <#> sets of <#> ."
then went downstairs and did the <UNK> trainer for <#> minutes .
so i did the neighborhood and the gym and i took my <UNK> .
i liked walking through the neighborhood this morning it was nice .
i never noticed how many rabbits are in the neighborhood but there are a lot of them .
"i weighed myself , did n't want to but i <UNK>"
i know i should n't weigh myself everyday but i did .
i 'm also about to start my period and have water weight gain .
maybe i 'll drop more once i start it .
"<#> lbs <UNK> "" tall body <UNK> i stepped on the scale yesterday and discovered that i had gained <#> lbs since this time last year ."
true it has been the hardest period of my life and i 'm coming back from it .
i sought <UNK> in food and i ignored my clothes getting <UNK> just brought new ones .
a dress i ordered from victoria 's secret came in on saturday and when i went to try it on it was way way too tight .
i had not ordered a dress from them in over a year .
<UNK> am going to workout until i can fit into that dress .
i <UNK> up with <#> minutes on the treadmill and went upstairs and lifted weights upper body .
"i did <#> sets of high <UNK> <#> , <#> at a light <UNK> - <#> lbs ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> , shoulders , chest and back ."
then downstairs and did <#> minutes on the <UNK> trainer burned <#> <UNK> post exact calories burned tomorrow when i have my exercise log with me . )
i do n't know if it 's because he 's looking to be left alone and i 'm looking for some company or what .
it makes me feel like a <UNK> - <UNK> with nothing better to do than complain about how bad their life is .
"i 'm not always <UNK> and cream and when something bothers me , i say so ."
they want out and the only way to do that is to insult .
"not long after our <UNK> , m. took my hand and kissed it and held it close ."
"good lord , i ca n't stay mad at him ."
i used to be able to .. but now he 's so far <UNK> into my heart that i have no control over it anymore .
"well , the day is slipping by and m. is n't home yet ."
i did n't think he would be getting off around <#> or <#> like he said .
i 've gotten all my house work done and have the laundry in the <UNK> .
"for the past hour or so , i 've been playing <UNK> on <UNK> ."
the challenge this week is to win ten <#> point games .
i 'm better at the game than i thought i would be .
"i got a <UNK> for that game back in january , but had to go and <UNK> the rules to <UNK> my memory ."
but she was n't on msn and so i figured that she did n't want to be disturbed .
i 'm not sure how she 's doing with her pregnancy and her feelings .
"i told her if it does n't go well , we 'll scream at the world together ."
just raise our heads and cry out at the <UNK> .
i hope they do n't try again though ... it just ca n't be good on her body .
i did our <UNK> today and we 're doing pretty ok .
"if i can manage to keep us on budget until next cycle , then i think we 'll have what we need to buy the <UNK> ."
"even if i had an ac , i would n't be using it right now ."
it 's <UNK> cool for this time of year .
i also have to make m. get up on the roof and fix the leak over the back addition .
it 's <UNK> pretty badly .. to the point that it worries me when it rains .
he should already have all the material he needs .
"if too much of the <UNK> has been damaged , then he may need to purchase a few sheets before he 's done ."
he <UNK> me that he 's got plans for getting it fixed .
i think i 'm just a worry - <UNK> .
i was so happy to have my baby home <UNK> .
"after he took a shower , we turned out the lights and just talked for a little bit ."
we then started kissing and touching each other - but i soon pulled away because he had to be up and read for work in only about <#> hours .
i do n't like the thought of going all day at home knowing that he 's dragging butt at work because i kept him up too late .
it was really nice to lay together in the dark of the night instead of by the light of day .
tonight i would imagine that we 'll go to bed pretty early .
today is <UNK> day ( d - day ) for him and there is no telling when he 'll get home .
i 'm hoping it 'll be around <#> or <#> pm .
i 'd like for us to have dinner together .
i 'm sure he 'll be very happy when this is over .
"today is wednesday and after i finish up here , i will go and see the new challenges on <UNK> ."
i played poker <UNK> and was on a winning streak . which is good because i needed to earn back the $ <UNK> i lost earlier in the day .
i talked with a. for a little while <UNK> on msn and
this is the second pregnancy she 's had since i 've known her and the last <#> only made it a short time .
i wonder when they will decide to stop doing this to her body .
"it 's not healthy and the more it happens , the more likely it 's going to happen ."
i just never really realized how difficult it can be to hang on to your pregnancy .
i guess i have always taken it for granted .
i have no problems staying pregnant and i do n't ever have any health issues .
i can move around just fine and carry on with life as usual .
"anyway , i wish her well - but i 'm not going to emotionally invest in this until i know it 's going to stick ."
my baby is home sweet home ! and even early !
i put clean sheets and pillow cases on today and it 's going to be a very good night indeed !
m. and i were talking last night about if we thought we would ever do this again with any other friends .
not that we actually have any other friends .
the only other <#> people that we have associated with are b. ( a different <#> ) and a. ( a different <#> ) hmmm ...
b - a - b - a ... do you see a pattern here ? ?
"anyway , i felt an attraction to b simply because of his attitude and the fact that he 's not ugly ."
he 's <UNK> sort of with an attitude like he 's king <UNK> .
it 's his confidence that draws me i think .
he put out the signals as well by always touching me and calling almost every day .
"at the time though , we had n't even considered having sex with our friends ."
m would feel the same way if i did something different with someone else .
aside from all that though i do n't think the safety of our current situation could really be <UNK> .
it has all just fell right into place and things like that are hard to <UNK> .
"and maybe down inside , i do n't really want to <UNK> anything ? ?"
"whew , i 've gotten a lot done today ."
i 'm looking forward to m being off at midnight tonight .
i can hardly believe it 's been <#> weeks already .
it 'll be nice to get back to something normal .
"also , we 'll be able to have more late nights with b and a. the last <#> times that we 've been together has been really great ."
"there for awhile , i thought that perhaps we were getting board with each other . or that perhaps m and i were moving on without them ."
"i think in reality though , we were still finding our places with each other ."
"urllink me , b. and a. b has such a cute butt !"
it 's just down right sexy ... reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> .
i 'm a be - <UNK> person and did n't even know it !
"thing is , i felt that a. really started to notice b. <UNK> after i said something about it a few times ."
i sometimes wonder if it has had the same affect on b. and a. ?
they ca n't just talk openly like m. and i can .
"at any rate , i think i look forward to our next meeting ."
sometimes i do experience jealousy ... it largely depends on my mood .
we became friends with b and a earlier this year .
"once we got to know each other and discovered that we shared a lot of common ground , we began hanging out with each all the time ."
every waking moment was spent in the company of each other .
"fortunately , they have a young daughter that is around the age of our youngest <#> ."
it did n't seem that it could be more perfect .
b even came over and helped my husband build a new wall in our house to create a third bedroom .
so that our girls could have their own room .
"we ate dinner together , watched movies and were hardly without each other ."
we got the sense from them that they ' liked ' us in a much different way than just friends .
"after about <#> weeks of intense friendship , we all decided to watch an adult movie together at our house after the kids went to bed ."
we did it in our bedroom so that <#> of the children would n't wake up and see something they should n't .
"anyway , the movie was n't on more than <#> minutes or so and things started <UNK> up between the couples ."
"to make a very <UNK> story short , we began making out and having sex with our <UNK> right in front of each other ."
"we kissed and touched each others breasts and then before i knew it , her husband ( b. ) was kissing me ."
then we split off with the other spouse and had sex .
then we all collapsed into a pile and <UNK> at what we had done .
i do n't want to give too many details as i 'm not sure if it 's appropriate here .
m and i have been married for <#> years and they have been together for nearly <#> years .
we all <#> come from long term relationships and so to be with another person outside of our marriage was really strange .
this happened in mid - march and here we are at the end of june .
we 've been together as a <UNK> every single weekend since then and sometimes once or twice throughout the week as well .
i 've learned a lot and i could have never predicted the impact it would have on my marriage ...
"good <UNK> , i 'm glad <UNK> is almost over ."
this is the last week we 'll have to deal with this .
then our lives can get back to somewhat of a normal routine .
"as for now , i 'm going to have to get to the store so that m. can have the car when he wakes up ."
i ca n't imagine why i want to post myself out on the internet like this .
"however , i 've had such a remarkable past few months that i 'm just screaming to share it with someone ."
"i could n't possibly tell anyone i know ; but , we 'll get to that later ."
i thought i 'd write a little personal information about myself .
i 'm <#> and have been married to the same person for <#> years .
we fell in love with each other <#> years ago ; when we were just <#> .
"we have <#> daughters , <#> is <#> and the other is <#> ."
we finally bought a house a couple of years ago and have been doing <UNK> on it as we can .
but we did that ourselves for about $ <#> .
"urllink i say "" ourselves "" but my husband did all the work ."
i did help to pick up the <UNK> though .
"i 've come close once , a few weeks ago"
but i fought it and i won and we worked things out soon after .
"but i have had this stupid idea stuck in my head that as long as i do n't cry , we 're doing ok ."
we 're <UNK> forward and not slipping back any .
that my tears would wash away all the happiness that i have felt and that they would be a calling card for the slow decent .... .. back .
i will close now and finish this tomorrow perhaps .
matt and i are on more stable ground now but i am still fighting those tears .
too many have already fallen for my liking but i could not stop them .
"i will <UNK> this later , as i have more to say ."
( the next day ) things do n't seem as <UNK> today as they did last night .
matt and i were able to get out of the mess last night and go to bed with peace and we awoke holding each other .
i 'm still not sure what went wrong though .
i am <UNK> to think that i should have not said anything but that surely would be a step in the wrong direction .
"i 'm just so afraid of being hurt ... actually , it 's not the being hurt that scares me , it 's the <UNK> that i fear ."
it <UNK> my gut into <UNK> even thinking about such things .
* sigh * but that 's no way to live and i know that .
i trust in matt and what we build with each other on a daily bases .
"the funny thing is , even sitting here now , i still feel like crying ."
matt is <UNK> the yard and the girls are doing their own thing .
i still feel a <UNK> in my chest for some reason .
it 's the doomed feeling i get when something near me is spinning out of <UNK> .
i have n't felt that in a long time and i confess that i have n't missed it <#> bit .
"as i 've always done when i feel the knocking , i will lay out the <UNK> and wait and see if something comes into focus ."
i 've always hated the waiting more than anything else .
i 've had so much going on it 's crazy .
i have some very interesting things to tell you but they 'll take a back seat for now because something else has brought me here this morning .
it was him and a friend that i 've never met .
for some reason i was <UNK> a relationship with the friend and j was with another girl .
we were in a big house by some <UNK> surrounded with trees .
"at <#> point , i almost slipped off the cliff , but saved myself at the last minute ."
then it changes to all of us being inside the house in the living room and the girl j is with is gone .
we are all over each other and we are at the verge of crying together .
it 's a painful mix of <UNK> and heavy sadness .
we fall back on the couch and strip our clothes and are about to have sex when his girlfriend walks in .
she 's not happy at all and starts to yell at everyone .
the dream goes on for a few minutes and then just seems to stall .
i wake up puzzled as to why i dreamed about him after so many years .
"my <UNK> thought is that i 've somehow <UNK> something with b to j. or rather , something about the situation ."
"when i woke up , for the <UNK> moment , i missed him ."
they are strong and are being <UNK> into the <UNK> of our souls .
"i know that i will ponder this dream all day long , trying to lay out the pieces and see how they fit together ."
i 'm trying to tell me something and i want to hear the <UNK> .
i just went back and <UNK> this and perhaps the longing towards being with j is actually reflecting my journey with m.
we have <UNK> so many new doors lately and it 's things that i have <UNK> over for so long .
perhaps i 'm not <UNK> b with j - but m with j. understand ?
the almost falling off the cliff is me saving myself in both situations before it goes horribly wrong .
the yelling woman is my brain telling me to just stop it .
and maybe the boyfriend on the couch who would sit quietly by and watch his girlfriend fall into another man is b.
is it b on the couch watching me and m ...
"- it does n't have that "" i 'm going to die if i do n't feed from this person right now "" feeling ."
"i think it has to be b on the couch , it 's the only thing that makes sense ."
maybe the yelling woman is a also .... because i know she is jealous of me .
m just called from work to say hi and that he loves me .
we spent all day at b and a 's and i made cherry <UNK> <UNK> .
lol . there were n't as many people there as were in invited but it was still a very nice time .
the guys especially because they always do jumps and things in the pool .
"plus , the heat can wear you out as well ."
i did get a lot of time to talk with a 's sister .
she had a lot to say about dogs and the different <UNK> and their care .
i am thinking of getting a dog and it was nice to pick her brain for a while .
"plus , it helped us to get to know each other ."
i wonder if a. felt weird about that at all .
"at <#> point , b. pulled himself from me and we were kissing and he was right there in my face while i came from what m. was doing ."
it was like having something hot and cold at the same time .
"the temperature not being the focus , but the vast difference between the <#> ."
"m. did n't cum with a. , he saved it for me which is a whole other story ."
he was so wired by the end of the night because he saved himself
he literally woke up the next morning <UNK> m. just came to bed and so i need to wrap it up soon .
"anyway , it was nice to have them over again ."
it had been a good <#> weeks between get <UNK> .
i did n't spend much time with a. that night .
i went into this whole thing being very much bi - curious .
"i have a whole new appreciation for them , the way they look , the way they move .... everything ."
"speaking of , m. is growing his hair out for me because he says i play with his head much more often than when it was bald ."
i love to run my fingers through b. 's hair and i would love to be able to do that with m. as well .
b is on vacation all this week and does n't want to wait until sunday to get together .
i 'm thinking of making time for it tomorrow night .
"although , today a. started <UNK> and we think she 's losing the baby ."
"if that 's the case , i ca n't imagine her wanting to do anything tomorrow night ."
"after swimming today , i went to their room to get my bra and put it on ."
a and b were in there and we all <#> just started getting changed and put together .
"it was nice to be able to be so comfortable around them to do that , but it was also kind of exciting being in their room ."
i do n't know why i did n't turn and face b. or try to touch him in any way .
i guess i was being sensitive to a and her possible loss of the pregnancy .
"i would have liked to touch at least a little bit , maybe sit on the bed and take him into my mouth for a minute ."
i have n't heard anything from her since she moved to tx .
i do have her new phone number and i was thinkin of calling her .
i wrote her today and told her about the updates we 've done in the bathroom and how the kids are <UNK> over the summer .
"the bathroom , i painted the tub a deep wine color and m. <UNK> the floor ."
just those <#> things make a world of difference !
the next thing is putting up a <UNK> - board type stuff and installing the new sink .
i wonder if i have a before picture of the tub .
"i do n't think so , shoot .. i should have taken <#> ."
"well , i think i 'm out of here now ."
i 'll go get something to drink and then head off to bed .
it 's only <UNK> but the morning comes early around here .
i think once we get the new <UNK> ( hopefully this weekend )
i can stay up in my <UNK> while m. goes to bed early .
s. ( my <#> year old daughter ) asked to ride her bike up to the school today to meet <#> of her friends .
i gave her an hour and a half and she just called and asked if her friend can come over and stay for dinner .
"what continues to <UNK> me is no matter how many books i stack on her head while she 's sleeping , she still continues to grow ."
( my mother used to say that ) she 's becoming such a little person ... although not so ' little ' anymore .
she 's wearing bra 's and noticing boys and talking on the phone all hours of the day .
"* <UNK> * m. is taking a nap right now , he just could n't make it all the way until bedtime ."
i guess it 's going to take more than <#> day to get back on our regular schedule . when he gets home tomorrow though
", he 'll be off for the entire weekend ."
<UNK> ) b and a have invited us over for a fourth of july cook - out and pool fun on sunday .
i could n't order him what i wanted to because of having to replace the ac in the house .
.. i 'll just have to be creative and give him something * else for his birthday .
"seriously , a card and <UNK> on the cheek will have to suffice ."
so i 'm expecting some late nights for sure this weekend .
"although , i think a 's brother is in town and if that 's the case , then they 'll probably stay home ."
"and , i think a. might be having issues with her pregnancy and perhaps not feeling very <UNK> ."
m. went to bed around <#> pm ... shortly after the kids .
"although i wanted to go with him , i just could n't sleep that early ."
i stayed up by myself until about <#> pm and then decided to try to get some sleep .
i took a shower and lay next to him and held his cock in my hand while i fell asleep .
he would stir now and then but never come fully awake .
"after about an hour , i turned over and he <UNK> me and held my breasts ."
he then started playing with my nipples and it felt so wonderful !
it just went from there and ended with him being inside of me and me <UNK> so perfectly .
"he came shortly after and we then walked to the kitchen , naked , to get something to drink ."
i do n't know but for some reason that really meant a lot to me .
the fact that we did n't split right afterwards .
"walking alone with him with nothing on , after pleasing each other so completely , was very touching to me ."
it 's the small things i guess that can sometimes mean the most .
we went to ( s ) 's orientation for school today .
she had a really great time and managed to <UNK> all of her fears .
she was worried about ' this ' or ' that ' and i told her it would all work out
and she would see that junior high is n't as complicated as it seems .
she 's very happy and that of course makes me happy .
<UNK> ) i was playing <UNK> with a. last night and
i reminded her that she said she 'd watch ( t ) .
for me tomorrow while i took ( s ) to school .
"she gave me this long pause and said "" well , ummm ..."
".. have to see if it 's ... umm , ok with her ."
""" she did n't actually say it that way in the chat , but that 's how she made me feel ."
"she did n't just say "" ok "" like she did originally ."
she then called me this morning and told me that it would be fine with her mother to bring her over this evening .
and that i should n't forget to feed her before we come over or to at least bring some dinner with me for her .
my first thought was how many times they have eaten here without any <UNK> and how often i feed their child without thinking about it .
"i do n't know , the whole thing just seemed weird to me and i got a funny feeling ."
"later in the day , ( b ) asked to come over on the way to the store ."
"once they got there , she seemed in a bit of a hurry to leave ."
especially when ( b ) moved to sit next to me .
i 'm not ' saying ' anything really ... just that it felt weird ...
"also , the other day i told her about how i thought that ( b ) does a really cool thing with his hands when we 're having sex ."
"i could n't really explain it very well , other than to say that i just liked it ."
he even asked me later what it was exactly because he really had no idea he was doing anything special at all .
"well , since then ... ( a ) has called him "" magic fingers "" around me ."
she goes on and on and on about what wonderful fingers he has .
"it 's like the butt thing , she does n't notice it at all until i make a comment about something ."
i think in reality she knows she 'll never be me or have what i have and so she tries to make me jealous of the things she has .
it 's weird .. and i 'm saying that word a lot tonight .
"lol and by the way , i took ( t ) with me to school ."
<UNK> came over several times today and guess what i notice ?
i do n't think it would ever go anywhere .... not like at the yard party
but i think she is intrigued by what happened and likes to have that open relationship with me .
she likes being a little bit <UNK> with another female .
it 's totally fine by me because she 's a good person inside and i like spending time with her .
"maybe there is something to that whole thing about "" it 's what 's on the inside that counts "" ."
i called ( m ) at the hotel this evening .
he said he 's been working hard and being good .
he said that he 's going to go have a beer tonight and that made my stomach <UNK> a little bit .
there is an ever present small fear that i 'm stupid and do n't see what is really going on sometimes .
i fear that i have closed off my ' <UNK> ' and am no longer willing to see anything outside of my perfect little bubble .
i mostly think it 's just the fear of totally letting go and having pure faith in someone .
"if i am ever to achieve that , i wish it to be with ( m ) ."
he is my everything and we are headed for <UNK> times .
to not feel like there is something terribly wrong .
"last night when i went to bed , i was a little frightened by all the noise in the house ."
i had to lay there for a bit with the light on because i was too scared to turn it off .
i did n't think of ( m ) because he 's so far away and it 's not possible for him to be here .
"the thought of ( b ) though and that i could have him come over , made me feel better ."
"i almost told her about my hair , but i had company coming in and out and did n't want to distract from the conversation once i told her ."
i think i 'll take some pictures and send them while i tell her all about it .
she said that daddy will probably have to have surgery soon on his neck .
he has some bone <UNK> that are getting bad and keeping him from being able to turn his head .
i hate the thought of my parents winding down .
tick - <UNK> - tick .... .... <UNK> .
i saw something on ( m ) 's computer that bothered me a little .
i was writing emails and thinking of sending my sister some more pictures and
i thought about amy and that i should write her .
so i got on ( m ) 's computer to get the address
"and i see that he has signed some of his letters to her as "" <UNK> "" or something like that ."
the thing that i guess that bothered me was the <UNK> of the signature and the fact that i had never heard him refer to himself in that way .
i felt like it was a small secret thing between them that i 'm not part of .
"and , i 'm not totally convinced that he would be faithful to me under the wrong circumstances ."
especially after all that we have learned in the past few months .
we are so different than we have ever been .
"ok , i warned you that i would write a lot this week ."
what else is there to do when the only thing keeping me company are the voices in my head ?
it 's 10:30 now and perhaps i 'll go play some games on <UNK> .
"ok , so <UNK> comes over today and asks to charge a cell phone , because you guessed it , their power got cut off ."
"so no problem , we find a <UNK> and she 's on her way for an hour ."
later in the day though she comes over with what looks like a <UNK> or something and asks to heat it in the microwave .
"on her way out , she asks to borrow the plate it 's heated on and i say "" ok , just bring it by later sometime ."
""" well , time goes by and the night is coming and i figure i have to do some <UNK> to get my plate back ."
i see <UNK> and her mom pulling up in the driveway and ask sarah to go ask about the darn plate .
"she started <UNK> at <UNK> about "" we do n't need their shit !"
she goes off on <UNK> so hard it makes her cry .
she makes <UNK> go get my plate and <#> of theirs to give to me .
", i just ca n't see where that makes any damn sense at all ."
i just stood their looking at this plate that is from another house and wondered what the hell do i do with it ? ?
"i mean , how is that a lesson of any kind ?"
"so , i now have this strange <UNK> plate that seems like it 's from another universe ."
i 've been <UNK> about the plate all day long .
it does n't go anywhere and i do n't even like where it came from .
"so , like , what do i do with it ? ?"
i 'm thinking perhaps i 'll paint on it and hang it on my door .
"it 'll say "" next time , bring a bowl . """
do n't know why but something is trying to take up residence in the house .
it 's been coming and going for the past week and it 's getting more intense .
"whatever it is , it 's pretty straight forward ."
it uses what it knows and makes it 's self known for some reason .
i do n't know if it 's good or bad yet ; it just kind of freaks me out when it makes things move .
it stays around me when it 's active ... if it does something tonight
"funny thing though , i 've had my mirror out less than a month"
i think i 'll be putting the mirror in it 's cloth tonight before bed and see if that helps .
it does n't help that i 've <UNK> into it several times lately without cleaning it first .
he has to go help a store that is opening in <#> days .
he and the store manager from here and <#> other employee are going .
* * he just called and checked in with me .
he was n't all <UNK> - <UNK> because he was <UNK> his bosses cell phone .
they are going to go down to the pool that the hotel has .
"man , i feel lonely and it 's only the first night ."
"* sigh anyway , i know that there is no reason to worry ."
everything seems to be on the up and up this time .
i ca n't imagine having to worry like i did last time he went out of town .
b. <UNK> me earlier and asked me if i was getting close to my period .
"apparently , a. started today and she is "" laying <UNK> that i start today or tomorrow ."
i asked b. why he asked me that and he said that a. told him that my nipples were tender .
"the truth of the matter is , i just did n't want her touching me there"
"<UNK> , so i <UNK> being a little sore ."
she 's too <UNK> and touches me like a guy would .
she 's got little <UNK> or idea about how a woman likes to be touched .
at least me anyway . who can say about others .
i told b. that i was tender from the <UNK> <UNK> ...
i 'm going to have to find a way to tell her that i 'm not interested in her . preferably before we go to see <UNK> this month .
"like matt said , "" i 'm going to see a show , not be the show . """
but i 'm glad he gets to go and get out of town for a bit .
"oh well , perhaps i 'll go play some <UNK> ."
i have a feeling that i will write quite a bit in the next few days .
i feel lucky because i 'm following behind people who have already gone through this process so i benefit from their experiences .
so because of them i 'll have everything i need to make the <UNK> much easier .
"lining up things to do for my final day here in san diego , the states ."
i still think i should be able to handle the challenge no matter how many people say i 'm crazy .
still waiting for the gallery section of my site to be completed so i can start <UNK> all of our pics .
well this is day <#> of what will be an interesting journal of my experiences traveling <UNK> .
got the website somewhat <UNK> and setup this blogger account for everyone to keep track of my experiences .
by reading some of the other guys logs who are overseas it seems that this serves as both a <UNK> and time passing activity .
i 'm hoping this <UNK> will <UNK> some of my anxiety and <UNK> about <UNK> this contract .
these are my final days here in san diego with my family and friends .
"been running around like crazy trying to get paperwork , <UNK> and personal items needed for this what seems <UNK> journey ."
"saw most of my <UNK> pals today , probably for the final time ."
"today felt like my first real personal day off , finally ."
"woke up early , about <#> after a short sleep night , which included talking on the phone with my sweetie and pounding out stuff on the computer ."
"this is something i haven’t touched on yet , the <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> in our area are basically <UNK> mobile homes with toilets , <UNK> , and showers ."
the smell isn’t too pleasing ( not that it smells like poop ) it just has a strange <UNK> .
"some are cleaner , some are flooded from the showers , some don’t have any toilet paper and some are but outright nasty ."
"the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comes to mind here , you know , the “ box of <UNK> ” reference ."
"you have <#> choices of water <UNK> , either hot or really hot water ."
there ’s nothing like taking a hot shower in <UNK> weather and getting out to get all sweaty and sticky again .
i guess that ’s life in the big desert .
after the shower i went over to the <UNK> hall with the other <UNK> for breakfast .
"<#> thing i have to mention here , the army has particular awesome tasting breakfast items ."
during breakfast we met up with yet another nice <UNK> guy who came from afghanistan .
"we of course <UNK> him , like we do with everyone , asking about everything from what ’s the company like to how are conditions in iraq ."
he was very helpful and answered pretty much all of our questions .
like i would be some kind of expert .
i spent the rest of the morning <UNK> pics to our website .
there ’s an internet <UNK> here that allows you to connect your own system to their network for internet access .
"the bad thing is the <UNK> is slower than dial up , i think ."
it took <#> hours to upload about <#> pictures .
"at home , on the cable modem , that would take a <UNK> of the time ."
like i have a whole lot to do anyway .
after that i went over to the <UNK> office and <UNK> their computer to check up on accounts and send out emails .
i met even more <UNK> guys who were all friendly .
"most of the people i talk to usually have positive things to say about <UNK> , much like my last company , <UNK> ."
i’m lucky to keep finding these good companies to work for and not some <UNK> company who could care less about its people .
i finished up the day with that short <UNK> from an army major about security and dinner at the <UNK> hall .
"the dinner menu isn’t too great though , at least if you’re a vegetarian ."
i’ll probably be eating more dinner meals at the food court .
not sure but i think this day might repeat itself for the next year .
"believe it or not , while i was at microsoft , i actually learned a lot about people ( or rather , customers ) ."
* every person also has <UNK> <UNK> or things <UNK> is bad at .
"* when someone is <UNK> good at something , <UNK> has a difficult time figuring out why someone else does n't just "" get it . """
* there is bound to be a portion of this population that is stupid .
"first of all , let me say the thing that i wanted desperately to say when i was at ms ."
"now , for the rest of the population , here 's the thing ."
there is not <#> worthwhile thing in our lives that we do n't have to learn to do .
"this does not mean , of course , that things can not be easier , or more logical , or better ."
jesus people - they 're just big dumb machines that are awaiting instruction from you so they can do as they 're told .
they are not evil beings that are trying to hurt you .
"and here 's the truth about you : if you do n't want to use them , then do n't ."
it is not the rest of the world 's problem or responsibility to make things easier for you .
that does not make you right and them wrong - it just makes you different .
it 's that cone . under the sheet .
"ok , not many will see this , since i am just getting started , and this is going to be my playground for awhile ."
"i will be working on my profile and all the other little things , but for right now ..."
found a disturbing article as i hit my home page .
"what the hell 's going on up there , <UNK> ?"
"could someone check this out , and let me know ."
"only glanced at the story , did n't click on links . trying to make sure that i get ...."
"gotta finish packing , load the bike , and hit the hay ."
"if you <UNK> feel the need , please limit <UNK> ."
( <UNK> - oh : sorry about the ceiling fan . )
i begin to wonder at the idea that i could now be so close to someone of whom i was so <UNK> upon meeting .
so tonight i have decided to give her her due attention by thinking about the things i love about her .
elizabeth ( aka <UNK> ) ... <#> .
( i am not beautiful and quite vain )
beauty is a <#> - <UNK> sword -- ask any woman in our society .
"to not be beautiful is to be an <UNK> , to be less - than , and ( sometimes ) to be <UNK> ."
"to be too beautiful is to be assumed <UNK> , stupid , without merit and , ironically , to be an <UNK> ."
elizabeth manages to be beautiful by every conventional standard and yet draw people to her instantly .
"she is loved rather than <UNK> , admired rather than <UNK> ."
i realized the clear evidence of this <#> day after i finished a <UNK> <UNK> about a mutual <UNK> -- i was critical and teasing and somewhat cruel .
she laughed without comment and we moved on to other topics .
suddenly i realized that not once have i ever heard her make a critical or <UNK> remark about anyone .
not once in the <#> years i have known her !
elizabeth has a tender heart that sincerely cares about and seeks out the best in most everyone .
she is willing to share weaknesses and <UNK> and i <UNK> at this since i am in constant fear of being found out weak .
liz is n't afraid of what other people think -- she is just willing to be liz . and
"through her willingness to be herself , <UNK> and all , i have learned the most remarkable thing about friendship -- that love is love , mistakes and all ."
"she walks with me , sometimes pointing the way ahead , sometimes <UNK> about the way behind , sometimes just being ."
there is nothing better than finding a way to make elizabeth laugh .
it is <#> of the things in life that brings me so much joy -- talking on the phone with her and getting her to laugh .
"what a treasure i have with a "" lizzie - friend "" in my life ."
to hear sharon olds read this poem is quite remarkable .
she was interviewed by terry gross on fresh air ( <UNK> ) several years ago and they had a wonderful conversation about revealing the personal in public poems .
is the poem interesting because it 's true -- because it 's really about her parents ?
"or is it interesting because , as sharon says , it "" jumps the fence a bit "" ?"
my question is this -- is it the poem itself or these questions which make the poem so fascinating ?
"<#> , "" the <UNK> , "" i read over and over again ."
"<UNK> , n. a person of low taste , more interested in himself than in me ."
<UNK> <UNK> i spent the last week with my father .
it gave me a better understanding of me .
( i am the youngest out of <#> daughters . )
"my oldest sister and i are both strong <UNK> and fighters ; the middle child of my family has everything that we lack , and her behavior <UNK> me ."
"for example , my father lives in florida on the coast ."
"when i was on vacation , he took me to the beach everyday , and i <UNK> in the sun , surf , and sand ."
"it felt so <UNK> , as if all my senses were being <UNK> , yet at peace ."
""" i learned to enjoy the ocean as a child with my sister ( the middle child ) ."
it was <#> of those memorable childhood experiences that i shared with her .
"when i was in florida , i asked dad if my sister was able to enjoy the beach when she was visiting over spring break ."
"he said that he took them <#> day , but she would n't go in past her knees because she had fears about sharks and the rip tide ."
i laughed when my father told me this .
"he finds it dangerous ; therefore , she finds it dangerous ."
has she forgotten her past and loves for life ?
does she allow her husband to control her every move ?
"as time goes on , i am <UNK> by her actions ."
how the fuck do i have a sister such as her ?
"to me , it is <UNK> and a part of me ."
why did she hate herself enough to allow a man to take such control over her life ?
i do n't hate him ; he is an <UNK> .
i hate the way she allows him to control her every move .
when <#> person allows another person to control their happiness ...
"i just have to say <UNK> dat , and open your senses and live ."
"if you allow a man to take away your identity , what is the point in living ."
all i can say to you is ... <UNK> dat !
"ok , ok ... all kidding aside , this is my first post to my blogger !"
i have my grandfather 's old <#> ford <UNK> !
i have plans for <UNK> many things on this truck !
i 'll be posting links to pictures soon ...
"i stopped back into the coffee house , and my photography show is up ! if you are in lincoln , ne , stop down and check it out !"
"the coffee house <#> "" p "" street lincoln ,"
"oh , how i love being sick ... especially when it means missing work ."
"i come down with something earlier in the week , end up missing <#> days at work , and things just fall apart while i 'm gone ."
"this results in me having to play "" catch - up "" for at least the next week ."
"this is n't the first time this has happened , either ."
"on <#> hand , it 's nice to be needed ."
"on the other hand , i could really use an assistant !"
"<UNK> do nothing else , but have no market outside japan ( why ? ?"
"hello , if anyone besides me actually ever reads this ."
"single minded and directed , the journey starts here ."
"blogging is mainly for keeping a record rather than to entertain , though if the record can be kept entertaining it helps ."
"so i write if something happens , and i write if nothing happens ."
i have n't planned or thought about what i 'll write here beyond describing the previous week since the last post .
"i spent <#> sessions on the garden , which saved it from an all - time invasion from all directions of weeds and bushes ."
"it 's a mess , but on tuesday it was a lot worse ."
"the cat always enjoys watching anyway , and follows me from the front to the back if i <UNK> over ."
normally that 's at the end of the list and only really gets done when i 've used up every other possible <UNK> .
"i 've even run out of things on the internet at last , after having free <UNK> for exactly a year ."
i suppose i 'll have to find life again away from the computer .
our national soccer team lost the semi finals in the european championship .
although this has nothing to do with my study .
this is some crazy thing with the country i live in .
"because this was n't the best team we ever had and the practice games really went very bad and the captain ,"
well the captain ... and the fact is when a national team has lost ' they lost ' .
"<UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> ' <UNK> of "" cost "" while i prefer to <UNK> the neglect of the <UNK> "" benefits "" of alcohol ."
"it will be interesting to see if kerry is even discussed at this event ... or will it be just more urllink "" beat bush "" <UNK> ."
sidebar : clearly dean has been promised a cabinet position in a kerry administration in exchange for his support .
i wonder which ( hopefully we 'll never find out ! ) .
"story in today 's wall street journal ( <UNK> site -- sorry ) , describing new local laws holding <UNK> , wal - <UNK> , etc ."
", responsible for shopping <UNK> stolen by customers , <UNK> <UNK> , the homeless , etc . , and then abandoned ."
"some towns are <UNK> <UNK> , while others are passing laws <UNK> <UNK> methods , such as <UNK> , wheel locks , etc ."
i 'm the <#> committing crimes and <UNK> .
so of course which <#> does kerry want to <UNK> around with ?
maybe urllink hillary 's approach is better .
how long do you think it would be before such a system would be abused ?
hire a <UNK> to frame them as <UNK> .
i do n't know what the solution is -- but it 's not that .
"... or is that trip , stumble , collapse ? could n't avoid it any longer ..."
the post then proceeds to destroy the <UNK> analogy .
"my concern , however , is how <UNK> and <UNK> the reader <UNK> around the word "" public "" -- exactly which "" public "" area would that be ?"
has not become either totally smoke - free or at least has <UNK> smoking areas .
"the issue , of course , is the casual willingness to impose <UNK> on private places , especially bars , hotels and restaurants ."
"( and please do n't bother with the whole "" do n't you know that urllink ' pub ' is short for ' public house ' ? """
you 're concerned about your right to breathe smoke - free air ?
"as i have urllink previously <UNK> : urllink without property rights , no other rights are possible ."
he will consider making sure that high - income <UNK> do n't get more out than they pay in .
"in his nomination acceptance speech at the democratic national convention , kerry <UNK> that he would not <UNK> social security ."
"as always , your single best resource for social security information is urllink <UNK> ."

"the los angeles county <UNK> 's department has waved goodbye to <#> <UNK> , closed several <UNK> and released some <UNK> early ."
"in houston , police officers are taking up the duties of <#> jail guards who were let go ."
we know that low levels of crime and violence are essential if cities are to <UNK> .
to even begin <UNK> the clock to that time of madness would in itself be an act of madness .
"but wait , there 's more : mayor martin <UNK> of baltimore , who co - chairs the task force on homeland security for the u.s ."
"conference of <UNK> , told me in an interview that <UNK> horror stories are coming in from police officials all over the country ."

"<#> , and "" the <UNK> effect "" of enormous [ oh really ? ]"
federal tax cuts at a time when the nation is at war [ huh ? ] .
"local taxes have gone up <UNK> , and services have had to be cut back even as federal taxes have <UNK> ."
is that somehow more complicated than having cities worry about federal taxes and washington worrying about local police forces ?
( compare and contrast : urllink my earlier post on federal highway money . )
that even the central <UNK> and their <UNK> of <UNK> ca n't keep track of it anymore .

<#> gasoline prices i hear we are going to hit close to $ <#> a gallon by the summer . want gasoline prices to come down ?
"we need to take some intelligent , united action ."
"the oil companies just laughed at that because they knew we would n't continue to "" hurt "" ourselves by refusing to buy gas ."
it was more of an <UNK> to us than it was a problem for them .
"but , whoever thought of this idea , has come up with a plan that can really work ."
<UNK> now you 're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $ <#> is super cheap . me too !
"with the price of gasoline going up more each day , we consumers need to take action ."
"since we all rely on our cars , we ca n't just stop buying gas ."
but we can have an impact on gas prices if we all act together to force a price war .
"if they are not selling any gas , they will be inclined to reduce their prices ."
"if they reduce their prices , the other companies will have to follow suit ."
"but to have an impact , we need to reach literally millions of <UNK> and <UNK> gas <UNK> ."
"now , do n't <UNK> out on me at this point ..."
keep reading and i 'll explain how simple it is to reach millions of people i am sending this note to about <#> people .

the kids are having a hard time <UNK> to life without dad .
have to talk to the doc about <UNK> his medication again .
will try to distract them tomorrow with a trip to the <UNK> .
i complain and complain that my kids do n't sleep ...
i have n't been able to sleep for the past couple of nights .
how do you explain war to your kids ?
how do you answer an <#> year old 's questions about death ? or a <#> year old asking every night for a good night kiss from daddy ?
"no matter how prepared you think you are , no matter how strong you think you are , nothing can prepare you for the long silence associated with war ."
troy called yesterday to tell me they were heading out on a mission and he would not be able to contact me for several days .
i understand the need for the <UNK> but it does n't mean it makes me feel any better .
i have n't really slept since we talked .
last night i kept drifting off only to <UNK> awake thinking i had heard the telephone or a knock at the door .
i just knew someone was coming to <UNK> me of some terrible event over there .
"granted , i have never been accused of being an <UNK> , however , i have always had an <UNK> <UNK> about things -- especially where troy is concerned ."
"regardless of what i do , or think about , i can not get these <UNK> thoughts out of my head ."
i do n't know how i 'm going to do this for an entire year ... and if his tour is extended ....
well i just do n't know what i 'll do then .
i 'm taking the kids to a <UNK> with the rest of the company families tomorrow afternoon .
hopefully being around all the other wives will make me feel a little less <UNK> -- or not ....
"anyway , i will be much happier when this long silence has ended and troy calls me to let me know all is well ."
i 've had time to think about everything .
all these nights alone after the kids go to bed has given me <UNK> time to reflect on the events of my life .
"through <#> marriages which have taken over half of my life , i have allowed myself to be the victim ."
i have allowed the men i loved to treat me badly and have obviously gained something from it because i never insisted on change .
it does not however mean that my new life will be separate from troy .
"i believe in us , even through the pain , i believe there is something <UNK> good with us and our relationship ."
"regardless of the past , i am willing to begin living in today and dreaming and planning for tomorrow ."
i do want to be his partner for life .
"i do want to be by his side as our kids graduate , get married , have kids of their own ."
"we have our dreams , we know our faults , our weaknesses and we need each other to work through them ."
when i think about leaving and about being single again ...
"well , i just ca n't see it ."
i can not <UNK> my future without him .
it 's hard enough that i 'm going to have to suffer through this for the next year --
"i will make my life work , i will make my marriage work ..."
i never know just when this roller coaster is going to jerk me around .
"connor <UNK> against me for well over <#> minutes today , biting , kicking , hitting , screaming ."
luckily meghan is <UNK> well enough by now to know when it starts to go immediately to her room to avoid getting hurt .
when it was all over connor <UNK> went to his room ( which is the request that started the rage ) and fell asleep for an hour .
"afterwards , he came down and apologized and was very <UNK> ."
i called and spoke with his doctor who decided that a medication change was obviously in need .
we completely stopped the <UNK> since that seemed to be the medication causing connor so much anxiety and increased the <UNK> both for mood <UNK> and <UNK> .
troy called early this morning ... around <#> am .
he seemed fairly <UNK> but claims to be rather lonely .
i suppose that 's only to be expected living with hundreds of guys in the middle of the desert !
do n't even ask me why i obtained <#> in the first place .

type a writers approach their trade with gusto and focus .
type b writers create elaborate filing systems and answer the telephone and the <UNK> .
"henry david <UNK> once wrote , "" men have become the tools of their tools ."
"some people can write on a legal pad , or on loose <UNK> of paper ."
"isaac <UNK> , according to the <UNK> to the foundation trilogy , wrote <UNK> of it on the backs of bus tickets . in my time"
i have purchased a portable keyboard for my palm to use as a <UNK> laptop ( in <UNK> with <UNK> pro ) .
"right now , i am writing this on an apple <UNK> purchased for me by my late grandmother for purposes of writing the great american novel before she died ."
i did n't get it written before she died .
i was answering the telephone and the <UNK> .
"the <UNK> uses <UNK> , a tool pretty much <UNK> for creating and organizing lots of text files ."
it allows me to create elaborate filing systems like never before .
"<UNK> organization was really my problem , was n't it ?"
"but the good news is , on the occasions when i really do generate some text , i know exactly where to find it again ."
"until the hard drive dies . which reminds me , i have to go buy a flash drive for backup purposes ."
"i am fairly happy with my little <UNK> , but as time goes on i begin to feel that i need a better laptop ."
"a faster <#> , a bigger <#> , <#> with a cd burner and some other toys that i probably will have to generate an actual use for ."
"however , it 's difficult to justify the kind of expense this <UNK> , especially when i 've grown fond of apple <UNK> ."
"they 're about twice the damn price , you see . because they 're apples , and stuff ."
not that the extra price necessarily <UNK> you much peace of mind .
"i could tell you stories about my original <UNK> , the <#> i had to get replaced eventually -- but that is a subject for another post entirely ."
"if i wrote a <#> word first draft in the month of may , i could buy myself a new laptop in june ."
i started out with good intentions and a great deal of energy ( most of it nervous ) .
"to my credit , i made some decent progress , but soon <UNK> due to personal concerns , jungle rot , <UNK> <UNK> , and other excuses ."
<#> words <UNK> from <UNK> goal to <UNK> madness .
<UNK> <UNK> of text files cried out for organization and leadership .
"so may became june , and june became whenever , and now june is over and the book is no closer to being done ."
"it can all be <UNK> up to a routine lack of discipline , a carefully measured <UNK> ."
"this is not a <UNK> aimed at myself , mind you ; just an observation of the facts ."
it is my habit to think about writing while <UNK> avoiding doing so .
"dare we even think it , which i enjoy ."
"so the theory is , make it work in reverse . if laziness is itself a discipline"
", a habit , a routine that is fallen into without thought or consideration , then let 's turn that fucker on its ear ."
do it for <#> week and you can do it for a month solid .
do it for a month solid and you can do it for a year .
and that 's where this little project of ours begins . <#> a phrase stolen from stephen king .
<#> <#> <#> is <UNK> as a daily writing project in which the author posts a <#> words a day .
"the point of the exercise is practice and discipline , if not necessarily <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"with luck , the former will give rise to the latter ."
think of it as a daily <UNK> challenge of writing .
"rumors grew in the east , whispers of a nameless fear ..."
"well ... okay , we got hungry late <#> night ."
"and , because we live in a not - so - big city , choices become somewhat limited after midnight or so ."
the diner - dive of choice became <UNK> 's .

"we order our food , which turns out to be the death of hope far sooner than we anticipated ."
"craving <UNK> after days of eating , well , crap , i order a salad with some <#> island ."
"i <UNK> , given the volume of dressing i 'm given , that this is so i can choose which quarter of the salad i want to <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , i <UNK> mount <UNK> ; my girlfriend , <UNK> her tomatoes , throws them on my plate ."
apparently it is some <UNK> rule of eating with women that my plate become the garbage <UNK> for the tomatoes they do n't want -- because it always happens .
someday i will meet a girl who actually eats her tomatoes and wo n't know what to do .
"probably tip the table over screaming "" this is bullshit ! "" and storm out . anyway ."
"i ca n't remember who came first -- <UNK> and <UNK> top , or <UNK> whore and the marine -- but it barely matters ."
"the point is , they came in -- and the peaceful part of the evening was over ."
<UNK> and <UNK> top are pretty much self - <UNK> .
"the guy was in his twenties , <UNK> , dressed like a <UNK> , complete with off - <UNK> baseball cap ."
the girl had a bare <UNK> and a <UNK> expression .
<UNK> whore was a <#> - year - old woman with a martha stewart <UNK> and a black dress that did little to hide her <UNK> <UNK> .
we 'll get to why i call him the marine in a minute .
"the <UNK> <UNK> them . "" hi , <#> tonight ? "" she asks ."
"the marine is <UNK> the <UNK> offensive , he ca n't be bothered to reply ."
"the waitress does n't see this , as she 's still on the "" how many "" question . "" right this way"
the waitress says that is fine and seats them .
""" so what 's the <UNK> on our food ? "" he demands ."
""" what ? "" the waitress asks , confused ."
""" the <UNK> ! "" the marine <UNK> ."
""" the what ? "" "" the estimated time of arrival ! "" the marine <UNK> ."
the marine had just demanded to know when the food that he had not yet ordered would be arriving .
some rich oil <UNK> to meet with later .
""" um , usually about <#> minutes , "" the waitress <UNK> them ."
""" do you know what you want ? """
""" no . "" <UNK> whore looks down her nose at the menu ."
the waitress wisely <UNK> for the next <#> minutes .
"this is <UNK> upon loudly every <#> seconds by the marine , incidentally , for whom ten minutes is equal to an hour ."
"meanwhile , behind me , <UNK> and <UNK> top are deep in a getting - to - know - you conversation ."
"while , sadly , i can not <UNK> all of what was said , i can give you the basic <UNK> of it : <UNK> : "" yeah"
"then <UNK> top started talking about some guy who had multiple girlfriends , to which <UNK> replied "" so they ' kick it ' every day ?"
i know i 've broken my vow many times before .
"but i 'm fuckin ' wiser and shit now , you know what i mean ?"
"every time i end up in a <UNK> 's , i vow never to go there again ."
"it 's obvious i would never make a good <UNK> , lonesome <UNK> seeking <UNK> ."
"i 'd just forget after a few months , what i was seeking <UNK> for , and what i 'd ever planned to do about it ."
my name is <UNK> <UNK> -- i 'll have the <UNK> over my <UNK> .
"now , my reasons for <UNK> never to set foot into another <UNK> 's as long as i live -- well , they barely need mentioning ."
"yet , somehow , <UNK> , and often without warning , i find myself there ."
i just know that it keeps happening .
"everything i am about to tell you is true , though much of it has now <UNK> the status of legend ."
"the first vow came many years ago , when i was still in college and the <UNK> 's was rather freshly <UNK> in our little dive ."
i ordered something <UNK> and <UNK> - <UNK> ; aaron ordered something with eggs on the side .
it did n't take long before we noticed the terrible old man across the aisle from us .
i never actually got a good <UNK> of the terrible old man .
the best way to imagine it would be to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drowning slowly beneath a non - stop <UNK> of <UNK> soup .
"i dared to look back a couple of times , and was <UNK> sorry i did so ."
"the good news is , it drew our attention away from the usual crappy service and bad food ."
"the waitress , in addition to being <UNK> , forgot aaron 's eggs ."
""" oh , i 'm sorry , i did n't bring your eggs , "" she said , laying down his plate ."
""" no eggs . "" we finished our meal and left ."
"as we were driving away , me behind the wheel and aaron sitting <UNK> in the passenger seat , he slowly began to <UNK> before my very eyes ."
"not a <UNK> <UNK> between brothers , but a screaming <UNK> shouted into the <UNK> void of some <UNK> summer day ."
the second vow ( that i can remember ) came when greg and i stopped in late <#> night for some sandwiches and perhaps some dessert .
"so , on a night when it was not particularly busy , and the wait staff far from <UNK> , we stopped in at the infamous <UNK> 's ."
this story is not nearly so epic nor interesting .
"the waitress merely took our order , delivered our food , and was never seen again by any living man ."
""" aw , i was just coming to see if you guys wanted dessert ! """
"our <UNK> server said <UNK> , fishing the bill out of her <UNK> ."
evidently she smelled the <UNK> <UNK> of her tip and was <UNK> for a last - minute <UNK> .
""" we did , "" greg said <UNK> , "" <#> minutes ago . "" upon <UNK> the restaurant"
", we asked each other why we 'd gone to <UNK> 's ."
neither of us could come up with a good reason .
and so we decided we 'd never go there again .
"the third vow was only a few weeks ago , when the girlfriend and i went to get breakfast ."
"again , this is something short of a saga ."
"we ordered breakfast : bacon , eggs , <UNK> , orange juice , coffee ."
"now , a bit of a side note about the coffee ."
"<UNK> 's coffee is , without doubt , the worst god damned <UNK> on the planet ."
"we have a local chain , <UNK> 's , which is pretty <UNK> , even <UNK> on a good day ."
"<UNK> is fairly acceptable , as diner - dive fare goes ."
"nothing to compare with real coffee - shop coffee , but <UNK> stuff ."
<UNK> 's brings to mind the old <UNK> - era <UNK> about a dirty sock tied inside a giant <UNK> .
"sure , it 's black , it 's in liquid form , you could even drink it ."
i need so much sugar and <UNK> to get through that mess that i have to ask for seconds of each before the meal is through .
"and given the track record on service , you can probably guess how well that goes ."
"now , the <UNK> were not that big a deal ."
"at least they did n't seem to be , at first ."
"well , shit , these <UNK> must be some manner of big deal , to be so thoroughly apologized for ."
"so we waited -- something like <#> minutes , in total -- for these <UNK> ."
"and when they finally arrived , they were <UNK> , <UNK> pieces of shit ."
"the kind of thing you bite into and instantly regret , for the rest of your miserable life ."
""" well , they 're kind of like <UNK> , on the outside , "" the girlfriend <UNK> , picking at hers <UNK> ."
"in december of last year , i bought my first <UNK> notebook ."
"i picked the small , <UNK> notebook for <UNK> because , i told myself , ideas must be allowed to flow freely without the <UNK> of artificial boundaries ."
"they must be allowed to <UNK> across the page , without <UNK> or regret , even if the space in which they seek to <UNK> is only inches across ."
"the other notebook , the lined notebook , was more serious business ."
"the boundaries here would be respected , because the lined notebook was for serious work ."
"of course , i started breaking my own rules right away ."
"the first page was a tiny paragraph , <UNK> into the center , about <#> men who had no ideas about what to write ."
i wish this sort of thing were a bit more <UNK> with me than it actually is .
the next few pages were notes for an <UNK> game i ran while visiting friends in <UNK> .
"then came an <UNK> "" part <#> , "" entitled the diary of <UNK> <UNK> ."
"the pages of this <UNK> <UNK> spread across the pages <UNK> , <UNK> their own boundaries ."
"<UNK> of paragraph breaks , the diary just <UNK> on and on like a <UNK> <UNK> ."
"to its credit , it went on for pages before finally running out of steam , right around the new year ."
"run - on sentences gave way to space - <UNK> <UNK> , a transparent attempt to <UNK> up the page count ."
i simply do n't have the stomach for it .
"i get self - conscious , and self - consciousness turns to self - <UNK> over the inability to lose oneself in <#> 's work while being around people ."
"the only really good writing is done with the door closed , as a lonely business , <UNK> of the <UNK> of kind words or gentle <UNK> ."
"there are pages full of this <UNK> material , all <UNK> of self - consciousness , <UNK> to <UNK> or transformation but <UNK> to little more than <UNK> ."
"it ends <UNK> , and begins again with part <#> : tea with the dragon ."
it <UNK> along for a handful of paragraphs and then died on the <UNK> .
more <UNK> . and a big page that says <UNK> in all capital letters . and
"suddenly , in the book , it 's april ."
"then may rolls around without a word written , and there appear several pages of notes about my trip to washington , d.c ."
"another page of <UNK> , and a page of <UNK> ."
"it 's the <UNK> section of the notebook , and probably the most important ."
"and then we 're on to part <#> , which is notes for that <UNK> novel , still in progress ."
"and now it 's july , and the <UNK> has been through some hard times ."
"the interior is a mess -- a <UNK> of different subjects , approaches , voices , <UNK> and even <UNK> styles ."
"i <UNK> in my mind neat rows of <UNK> text , a <UNK> of well - organized thought , <UNK> over time ."
"instead , it 's like an <UNK> ; an organic mess of <UNK> , spread out all over , getting a mess everywhere , <UNK> their boundaries ."
"and in that , it 's turned out to be far more personal , and <UNK> , than any <UNK> <UNK> diary ever could have been ."
"i spent the night <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> creation myth notes for a story i 'm working on ."
"since it is , technically , writing , i 'm placing it here as <UNK> of tonight 's contract ."
never mind if it is n't much interest to you and / or not at all funny .
"a <#> words is a <#> words , dammit ."
"when the egg broke , the pieces of the shell fell into the waters and became the <UNK> islands ."
"in the best - known <UNK> creation , the ex <UNK> creator is <UNK> , the ocean god for many <UNK> , but the supreme being for the <UNK> ."
<UNK> lived in space alone before there was any form to the universe .
"he stood still once , and a rock grew ."
"he told the rock to split , and it did ( see also creation by word ) ."
"many other rocks came along , too , representing various phrases and ideas still used by the <UNK> ."
<UNK> hit the original rock and it gave birth to the earth and sea .
"<UNK> spoke to the main rock many times , bringing forth fresh water , the sky , space , height , and other <UNK> and ideas ."
"he also called up <UNK> and <UNK> , man , spirit , heart , will , and thought ."
then he left his creation floating about <UNK> after <UNK> the rock .
"<UNK> told the rock that spirit , thought , will , and heart were to come together in man , and they did that ."
man was to join with earth to make a couple -- <UNK> ( male ) and ' <UNK> - <UNK> ( female ) .
they were to <UNK> a certain part of the world .
"night and day lived in a lower heaven and produced <UNK> , <UNK> , sun and moon as <UNK> ."
"the messenger called night , day , and their children to a council with the creator and the <UNK> ."
there they were told that <UNK> and <UNK> should go down and become chief over the <UNK> of <UNK> and ' <UNK> - <UNK> .
"sun and moon were to go down , too , to follow night and day ."
"it was <UNK> , for instance , who first made woman -- out of red clay ."
"she became the mother of humanity by <UNK> , who then committed <UNK> with their daughter ( see also <UNK> in creation <UNK> ) ."
the first male was named <UNK> or <UNK> ( see also some other shit i do n't want to <UNK> ) .
many <UNK> say that in the beginning there was <UNK> and papa ( heaven and earth ) coupled in darkness .
their <UNK> wondered about creation but could not see it because there was no light .
"they held council , and the <UNK> of the children , <UNK> , suggested killing the world parents ."
"his brother , <UNK> - <UNK> , suggested the simpler process of <UNK> the parents ."
only the god of winds and storms voted against this plan .
"<UNK> - ma - <UNK> , the god of <UNK> , tried to stand up to separate the parents , but he failed ."
"<UNK> , ocean god of fish and snakes , tried next but also failed ."
now there was light and the people were revealed .
"the wind god was angry , however , and he sent forth a <UNK> series of storms and <UNK> to punish his brothers ."
"the various <UNK> of <UNK> and papa , led by the forest god , <UNK> , and the ocean god , <UNK> , argued over what to do ."
"some chose to go to land , some chose going out to sea ."
"<UNK> gave his children <UNK> and <UNK> so they might catch the children of <UNK> , and sometimes <UNK> swallowed up <UNK> 's people ."
it is still this way today between the children of <UNK> and <UNK> .
"eventually the fierce brother , tu - <UNK> , who had originally <UNK> <UNK> and papa , <UNK> the wind god and ate all of the original gods ."
"tu - <UNK> is , in reality , the form called man , and after he ate his brothers , he turned them into food for his <UNK> ."
this is what the original gods are today .
still another south pacific myth says that the people live in a huge coconut shell .
"she made the first human being , <UNK> , from a piece of her body ."
"the father of humans and gods alike , <UNK> was half man and half fish ."
"his name means noon , and his eyes are said to be the sun and the <UNK> <UNK> was given the perfect middle land between <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"later he would marry the well - known <UNK> goddess , papa ( foundation ) ."
out of her body the mother made many other beings and places for them to live .
"she even made <UNK> ( trouble ) , who controls the winds ."
"her last child was the beloved daughter , tu - <UNK> or tu , to whom the moon is sacred ."
her nephew was the famous <UNK> god <UNK> ( <UNK> ) .
"<UNK> creation in the beginning there was darkness and water , where <UNK> lived alone and <UNK> ."
"in order to become active , <UNK> <UNK> words calling on darkness to become "" light - <UNK> darkness "" ."
"when <UNK> called for the light to become "" dark - <UNK> light , "" darkness returned ."
"<UNK> continued creating with words -- the "" ancient and original <UNK> , which caused growth from the void . """
( see also creation by word ) <UNK> called on the waters to separate and the heavens to be formed
"most important , he created <UNK> and papa -- sky father and the earth mother -- who <UNK> together in a <UNK> embrace , <UNK> their <UNK> ."
"<#> of these , <UNK> and <UNK> , created plants , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
<UNK> separated his parents to make more room ; he was the god of life .
<UNK> and papa were so sad to be separated that to this day <UNK> drops tears on papa and papa 's sighs rise as mist to her spouse .
"other children of the first parents were the winds , rains , <UNK> , and tu , the warrior god whose children are the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> child of <UNK> and papa was <UNK> , the father of the hero <UNK> ."
some say that the sun is the eye of <UNK> and that the eyes of his children became the evening and morning stars .

i 'm not a real firm believer in having the girlfriend shit while you shave .

"but the truth is , the movie is a delight of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> irony ."
"but anyway , the movie . it opened with a man running <UNK> - <UNK> through a <UNK> , and went downhill from there ."
"i 'd recap the plot , but there 's not much point ."
a <UNK> is making an army of evil robots and <UNK> killer halloween masks that are going to blow up and kill all the kids on halloween night .
it 's up to a <UNK> doctor with bad 80s hair and his frequently - naked <UNK> to save the day .
"so far , we have a delightful <UNK> of <UNK> ."
"we have the "" intense "" doctor who ca n't say any of his lines without seeming completely <UNK> ."
"we have a <UNK> old <UNK> with a ridiculous , <UNK> irish <UNK> ."
"( not surprisingly , he is killed for what he knows . )"
we have a nice middle - aged <UNK> who 's so sweet and nice
she might as well <UNK> victim on her forehead .
<UNK> kid on a bike even <UNK> his mom the bird !
"oh , it 's a little too late to start worrying about <UNK> laws now , dr ."
you can tell they 're robots because their performances are <UNK> and wooden .
"actually , maybe i 'm not so sure they 're robots ( <UNK> . )"
her <UNK> - like face will haunt my dreams forever .
"you do n't know what the fuck i 'm talking about , do you ?"
"look , it 's just some <UNK> come to give their <UNK> dialogue ."
"at the beginning of act <#> , we are treated to a heart - pumping rocket ride <UNK> how to make <UNK> halloween masks ."
"when this movie was in the theaters , they must have had nurses on duty to take <UNK> ' <UNK> ."
it 's a plot to laser all the kids ' heads off with killer laser - shooting <UNK> !
i bet you think i 'm making this up .
"now dan <UNK> is literally rubbing his hands together with <UNK> <UNK> - like <UNK> , <UNK> it up like a low - rent vincent price ."
"well , now the heroes have discovered the evil plot ."
""" it 's time to call the marines , "" says doctor <UNK> ."
i guess they must just have an <#> number somewhere that you dial to <UNK> their asses to crazy old <UNK> towns run by dan <UNK> .
"but -- oh no ! he ca n't call the marines , the phone 's not working !"
"now the robot guys in suits are lined up in the street looking like they 're about to perform "" leave it "" by yes ."
and now the actors are driving cheap <UNK> around town to the tune of epic john <UNK> theme music .
", doo doo doo , doo doo doo , doo doo doo ( loop for <#> minutes ) ...."
"and now we have a guy running through a <UNK> again , trying to escape from jon anderson and the agents ."
"<UNK> enough , his <UNK> wandering brings him right to the evil villain 's complex , which he immediately ( and <UNK> ) breaks into and starts poking around ."
"i feel i should mention that up until now , there has not been <#> <UNK> creepy moment in this entire movie ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , sure , got that in <UNK> , but nothing really creepy ."
"i will admit , that was good stuff ."
because he 's a robot ! or because your air - <UNK> are missing him by a country mile .
"whoa , punch a robot hard enough and they <UNK> up <UNK> of honey mustard ."
and now dr . hat - hair has been captured by the <UNK> <UNK> .
i guess we can start the countdown until dan <UNK> starts <UNK> his <UNK> plan to kill all the kids with laser <UNK> .
"i 'm going to go with <#> minutes , tops ."
with time out for him to deliver this <UNK> <UNK> about the rare old knitting lady robot being made in <#> in <UNK> .
"look for more <UNK> comedy here as <UNK> <UNK> a big old speech , turns <UNK> to face dr ."
", who has been standing in the center of the frame for the last <#> minutes , and says "" oh ! there you are , doctor ! """
"( here we fade out to a sunrise , and a nice insulting card saying : "" saturday , october <UNK> . """
"a good <UNK> never explains his secrets , "" he said ."
and now it 's revealed that the halloween laser - <UNK> plot has something to do with this toy company stealing a piece of <UNK> .
they just made off with a chunk of <UNK> .
oh man -- it looks like <UNK> kid is about to get it .
"they 're <UNK> a "" <UNK> "" where they strap the killer <UNK> mask to the kid 's head and -- oh , this should be good ."
"why they are doing this ? who cares , as long as that kid gets it ..."
"now if only they could play the theme from "" benny hill "" during this , it the scene would be perfect ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> dad just got bitten by the <UNK> that came out of his son 's head . and crazy <UNK> <UNK> music is playing . and"
am i asking too much of the third halloween movie ?
"well , with doctor <UNK> <UNK> with horror , it looks like it 's up to nurse sexy <UNK> to save the day ."
"well , it barely matters , looks like she 's about to get fried by the robots ."
"he 's gonna kill her with a <UNK> -- no , wait , a power drill ."
"oh , and right in the ear , too ."
sigh ... and now the little cards are telling us what time it is .
it 's now been officially established by the movie that we do n't need a reason for this <UNK> .
""" "" do i need a reason ? "" that will teach me to wax sarcastic ."
"or , no , wait -- it has to do with "" the ancient tradition of halloween ."
i 'm not even going to go into detail .
"no , i mean "" the planets do ! """
"so , you 're gonna kill all the kids because of <UNK> ."
now a blank - faced guy in a lab coat is pushing on <#> of those 80s <UNK> computer <UNK> .
they exist nowhere else but in crap 80s movies .
"oh , but the "" joke "" is on dan <UNK> , because the good doctor is now making his escape !"
and there 's a lot of crawling in them .
"just for the heck of it , i 'm gonna call that dan <UNK> is actually himself a robot , right now ."
i 'll check in with myself later to see if i was right .
doctor <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> long enough to -- i 'm not making this up -- get on the phone and argue with his ex - wife .
"i 'm going to level with you , if this goes on a whole lot longer i 'm going to start <UNK> my own face off ."
now here 's a bit where our heroes hide behind a box waiting for a guy to walk by .
this truly is a <UNK> of well - trained <UNK> <UNK> .
they stand <UNK> by and watch their own death <UNK> being signed .
i guess no <#> old them about <UNK> 's <#> laws .
"and , well , another guy just <UNK> up some honey mustard ."
"and <UNK> just stands there watching , as that <UNK> <UNK> music just plays on and on ."
i feel like i 'm probably gonna be .
oh -- and now the finale -- killer <UNK> ! ! ! the piece of <UNK> is gonna kill the big bad doctor -- on general principles !
and he just gave doctor <UNK> a golf clap for <UNK> him !
and there 's a big <UNK> <UNK> of them running away from a <UNK> explosion and -- wow . i have no words .
"but -- oh no ! the love interest was ! as they 're driving away from the big , bad , blowing - up factory"
she 's gonna puke up honey mustard any second !
and then he <UNK> her skull in with a tire iron .
and he thinks it 's over -- but then he 's attacked by the robot girl 's <UNK> arm !
"again , there 's just this number you dial , and you get the guy in charge of taking all the shit off the air ."
"and so the movie ends , with the doctor screaming "" stop it , stop it , stop it ! """
"into the phone , cut to black , and i think i agree with his sentiment , <UNK> ."
"thanks for stopping by . <#> and immediately scream "" i can still see ! """
"like the <UNK> ending to x , the man with the x - ray eyes . <#> her name is <UNK> ."
"last night , i watched last house on the left ."
"dude , i 've been in a german death camp , they look nothing like that ."
"in fact , i 'll tell you right now , there are some things about this movie i did , in fact , find genuinely disturbing ."
"just , maybe , not what you might think . but"
"first , i 'm going to spoil the plot ."
", do n't read any of this next paragraph , because i 'm going to give away the whole <UNK> ."
"<#> young girls go out in the woods , to the tune of shitty <UNK> music , to find some "" grass "" and go to a <UNK> concert ."
the killers then wander a few dozen yards to the house where the parents of <#> of the girls live ( ! ) .
"the parents , through a <UNK> that could <UNK> be called <UNK> , discover that these people killed their daughter ."
the parents then go on a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> their daughter .
"the cops show up too late in time to stop the <UNK> , some strawberry alarm clock plays , and that 's the end ."
"now , admittedly , this sounds pretty disturbing on paper ."
"granted , a few things <UNK> this movie from total <UNK> ."
", it was wes <UNK> 's first film , and frankly , he 's been pretty much downhill from there , so there 's that . and"
i do n't know how the crew thought the <UNK> of this score would even survive its own <UNK> run .
i 've never been a huge fan of wes <UNK> 's work .
"as an old friend so <UNK> put it to me years ago , "" he 's never been afraid to take a <UNK> to a good script . """
"the nightmare on <UNK> street series , i 've watched little of and can do without ."
"the <UNK> and the rainbow was good , right up until "" <UNK> nut nail , "" and"
the entire scream series is <UNK> shit .
"last house is an incredibly brutal film , yet so <UNK> and <UNK> on some levels that it almost becomes an <UNK> <UNK> of itself ."
which explains a lot about wes <UNK> 's <UNK> since those days . that alone nearly made this movie worth the price of <UNK> .
"! you left the <UNK> in there again ! """
"i also loved <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> , and ( i 'm a little ashamed to say ) <UNK> ."
"( i mean , really , <UNK> was the bastard <UNK> of other , <UNK> games ."
it was like the dim younger brother you keep locked in his room when company comes over . )
"as a general rule , where video games were concerned , i loved anything with <UNK> and / or <UNK> ."
"no matter how <UNK> shitty the game , if it had <UNK> or <UNK> , it was almost never bad ."
you could keep your <UNK> man and your q - <UNK> and your <UNK> with your cute little animals <UNK> up or <UNK> on abstract objects .
preferably with a large and well - animated explosion .
just because i loved these games does not mean i am any good at them .
"but , over ten years of playing this game , and i still get my ass whipped on level <#> or <#> ."
"then your game is over , you grab some <UNK> <UNK> and a big <UNK> from the front counter and go the fuck home to play star wars guys ."
there was a game i could last awhile at .
"sure , it still had innocent casualties to gun down , but i always had a somewhat better chance of saving them ."
talk about burning the village in order to save it .
the cure is almost worse than the disease .
"what 's really funny , of course , is the "" story "" behind <UNK> : the year is <#> ."
technology and <UNK> are at a dangerous peak when man <UNK> the ultimate species .
a species so advanced that man falls victim to his own creation - the <UNK> .
"guided by their <UNK> logic , the <UNK> concluded : the human race is <UNK> and must , therefore , be <UNK> ."
"due to genetic engineering error , you possess <UNK> powers ."
your mission : to stop the <UNK> and save the last of the human race .
"now , let 's examine this for a minute ."
"first of all , the humans from the game invented the <UNK> ?"
these guys ca n't even get out of the way of a moving milk truck .
"second of all , their savior was not <UNK> <UNK> to save them -- that was an accident . "" ha - ha , well , mr ."
"<UNK> , there 's been a little ' <UNK> ' down at the lab ..."
we gave you <UNK> <UNK> and a <#> - way laser !
", frankly , a race of what <#> can only conclude are blind , deaf , <UNK> morons -- <UNK> a certain sense of <UNK> to the whole affair ."
and do n't even get me started on <UNK> and <UNK> and their <UNK> formation attacks against an army of <#> .
"i guess the <UNK> is that in the future , the <UNK> of the alien space <UNK> will be <UNK> entirely by control - freak interior <UNK> ."
"you 're a single soldier trying to survive in a world full of hostile , <UNK> - <UNK> - like aliens who attack for no particular reason ."
"thankfully , your guy is neither the subject of <UNK> genetic <UNK> by a race of <UNK> , nor <UNK> to save said <UNK> from their own <UNK> <UNK> ."
"( hey , speaking of <UNK> , how about <UNK> ?"
"all you have is your <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and an endless supply of handy power - ups , <UNK> dropped by your <UNK> upon their deaths ."
those <UNK> bands of <UNK> aliens -- always so helpful in a pinch .
"unlike <UNK> , this game is full of <UNK> ; it 's a little less <UNK> than its spiritual <UNK> , but makes up for it in sheer <UNK> ."
"( really , do n't we all want to shoot faster , deep inside ? )"
"not bad , for having neither <UNK> nor <UNK> ."
"i have found , and for selfish reasons , that the reporting of the war in iraq misses some of the most important stories and reports non - events ."
in baghdad any event goes over as the start of the iraqi <UNK> offensive .
some of the most useless reporting comes from the reporting of so - called controlled <UNK> .
"a controlled explosion is where a piece of <UNK> <UNK> , an enemy <UNK> or rocket , is blown under <UNK> of <UNK> ."
these happen in every city and town where coalition forces are <UNK> . here in <UNK>
"about once a week he moves around the city dropping round within <#> <UNK> of the base , rarely do they cause damage ."
watching the news you would think that not only does the war only happen in baghdad but the rest of the country sits by the pool drinking <UNK> juice .
also it is not as bad as the media makes out but it 's still war .
"no soldier will ever admit to that because he wants to tell the "" i 'm a hero "" stories when he gets home ."
the northern region of the country has its fighting but <UNK> and baghdad are the <UNK> .
make you think it 's much worse than it actually is .
the war reporting as it is now shorts all the <UNK> in this theater who are not in the <#> darling cities .
another problem is the impression of total breakdown of relations with the iraqi people .
i have had only a few incidents where someone has said a cross word to me and most of them were children not aware of the meaning .
talk to the majority of iraqis and they will tell you they are glad the war <UNK> the <UNK> party and <UNK> <#> <#> man slave ring .
"this is a country added to the list of nations that the people in many years will say ,"
""" i remember when the americans came to <UNK> us "" ."

wmd 's were a fact to all politicians until we did n't find them .
"the al - <UNK> connection has been found for those of you who did n't hear we have captured many <UNK> here , i have been there ."
screw politics and the <UNK> - <UNK> on both sides these people are free and it 's up to them to want to keep it .
"i have found , in the few years i have been on this rock , that the biggest problem with all people on this planet is emotion ."
emotion for the things they love and no give to the truth or fact .
the search for fact can only lead to <UNK> whether we believe it or not ( to <UNK> own self be true ) .
i have had many of my belief bubbles burst and others <UNK> .
in the end my emotions were <UNK> and my belief system <UNK> .
if the personal search for the facts and the <UNK> study of the world interests you come by .
"does everyone have the right to go to university , yes ."
university should be reserved for those who have shown that they have the dedication to work for their education .
students all over the country work for an honor roll only to have that achievement <UNK> by a simple entrance exam that lets any <UNK> waste their money .
"i have heard some people say they ca nt take tests , then they should try harder or do something else ."
education has been <UNK> by feeling everyone has to go to college .
"how many times have people taken <UNK> , <UNK> , and aid for school later to drop out half way through ."
so many students have missed out on an education because everyone feels they need to go to college later to find they ca n't do it and drop out .
this all - <UNK> education has lowered the standards for some schools .
"entrance exams use to mean you passed you 're in , fail you 're out ."
now it 's to see what level of <UNK> math to put you in .
any education is worthy even a trade school that will better your present job and forward your career .
every job is needed and the man who <UNK> your car is as worthy a member of society as the lawyer ( maybe more so ) .
i have little college and what i have has been for my own entertainment and <UNK> or for military promotion points .
but as a <UNK> in the army i have no need for anything other than <UNK> classes <UNK> to my job .
america has a love affair with its political parties .
usually they only vote on <#> maybe <#> issues and disagree on the others .
"abortion , guns , terrorism , and foreign policy are some of the hot buttons ."
"i love my guns but find religious <UNK> into government policy <UNK> , who do i vote for ."
the republicans will protect my right to own a <UNK> but the democrats will keep the church out of my schools .
single issue voting is why americans are pissed off at the system .
did more to take my guns than clinton but clinton had <#> years and dozens of attempts and let osama bin - laden walk .
"i hate abortion and corporate welfare , see where this is going ."
people love their party even when the other guy sounds better .
"they just ca n't bring themselves to vote for him , just in case he screws up ."
this latest crop of democrats has to be <#> of the <UNK> in years .
w. on the other hand is no prize pig .
the love of this myth of open democracy has been something that has caused the <UNK> of the belief in the noble politician .
"the citizen politician is dead in favor of the career politician , or as i refer to them , bottom feeding <UNK> <UNK> ."
unfortunately there is no cure until the american people demand a representative party of the majority .
no <#> wants a war but if there is <#> fight hard and finish .
no <#> wants poverty but instead of supporting it back education and <UNK> programs .
throwing money at a problem no more <UNK> it than ignoring it .
just to make myself clear this is not an <UNK> of any party .
"all i , well we , can hope for is that america wakes up and actually votes their conscience instead of sticking to the same old rhetoric ."
<#> day when you 're alone sit down and say your beliefs out loud .
debate yourself and you may be <UNK> at how silly they really are .
<#> of the <UNK> <UNK> of the last <#> years has been the shift of the black community to the party that fought hardest to keep slaves and <UNK> .
the politically correct left has managed to maintain a system of racial separation in america and get the love and support of the people it 's <UNK> .
i have said many times on this blog that my problems with this society has never been racial but cultural .
there have been savage white cultures as there have been <UNK> black cultures through history .
the left has created a victim mentality and a culture of <UNK> poverty in america 's black communities .
the myth of <UNK> action takes people down a step because even those who make it on their own <UNK> have the <UNK> of the program over them .
it is noble to think that people will look past all that but the world is as cynical as we all think .
what has the left really done for <UNK> ( remember i am <UNK> ) .
al gore <UNK> . tried to block the civil rights act while his son tries to <UNK> his dad 's <UNK> in the program .
most of the most famous <UNK> are dem 's .
"even <UNK> <UNK> was a dem ' when he was a <UNK> , later changed and became a republican ."
the <UNK> of equality has been a conservative issue .
"we are americans , not <#> <UNK> as the left loves to say ."
when the country realizes we are <#> people we will eliminate the problems and the programs that keep us seperate .
for the record this new republican party is no prize pig either .
the equal starting line is what america is not an equal finish line .
"that goes for you angry white men too ,"
sometimes it 's just because he 's better than you and not because he 's black .
history has always shown the greatness of the individual .
modern popular culture has taken the individual to a level that reaches <UNK> <UNK> by not <UNK> out great individuals but all .
throughout man 's history names of great men have <UNK> the <UNK> of various movements that claim them as thier own .
the issue come in where the value of the individual is given to those who have given little to the actual <UNK> or <UNK> of a movement .
"every person should have the right to express his own political , cultural , or religious values ."
problems come in when great minds are <UNK> as being <UNK> when their idea is shown as superior to the common <UNK> .
"we do n't want someone better than us , or is it that we do n't want to admit that someone is better at something than us ."
we all have a <UNK> <UNK> that makes us unique .
"everyone has something that , if <UNK> , can benefit themselves and others ."
"<#> of the worst things i heard when president clinton was elected was , "" he 's just like <#> of us . """
i do n't want <#> of us in charge i want someone to look up to .
someone who has a more informed plan or idea .
i expect more than the average joe to take charge .
"<UNK> in politics , science , the arts , and music are made by individuals ."
groups follow and <UNK> but the <UNK> mentality <UNK> growth instead of promoting it .
the individual with a <UNK> vision is what <UNK> change .
we need to return to the <UNK> of great individuals and remove the <UNK> of intelligence from america .
"* mankind does nothing save through <UNK> on the part of <UNK> , great or small , and <UNK> by the rest of us ."
individuals show the way and set the patterns .
the <UNK> of the patterns is the history of the world .
either way it 's over deal with it .
the polls will open at <#> a.m. eastern and <#> a.m. mountain and stay open for <#> hours .
"there will be no exit polls , no early results , and no reports given until <#> % of the votes are counted ."
same day run off to ensure a majority vote .
the first is obvious as to why it will work .
number <#> gives equal time to all states without the possibility of western votes being <UNK> by early eastern results .
"point <#> deals with a similar problem in that exit polls cause people to not "" waste "" their vote by voting for the "" obvious "" loser ."
also it will bring people out by not assuming their guy already won .
the same day run off is exactly for what has happened in the last <#> elections .
this would automatically knock out the third party candidate if he has the minority and the winner would do so by majority .
this would kill the <#> % wins we are so accustomed to of late .
the winner of any election that does not have a majority can not claim he has a <UNK> .
<UNK> these over and think about the last elections .
"america needs elections that give the people confidence , not contempt , in their process ."
"first things first , i believe in nothing so this is not rant to justify my beliefs ."
the ' <UNK> and ' 70s gave us those <UNK> .
they still give the earth an <UNK> existence as if it was a giant <UNK> with us living on it like a tick or <UNK> .
the ' 80s gave us the death metal <UNK> <UNK> .
in the mid to late ' 80s it was new age
and unfortunately we still have <UNK> and john <UNK> who left entertainment tonight to pursue a career in bad music .
"every <UNK> thinks their <UNK> , or whatever the hell they call it , is the true <UNK> ."
the only thing that makes this funny is that all the <UNK> that were following guru 's and <UNK> 's in the ' <UNK> are now becoming christians again .
"i guess they do n't want their kids having the same fun and <UNK> they had , and they realized mom and dad were n't that bad afterall ."
"<UNK> or <UNK> , depending on what hollywood rag you read , is the latest wallet - vacuum to come up ."
madonna and <UNK> moore have <UNK> its <UNK> . then again madonna <UNK> gen .
"tom cruise and john <UNK> , <#> other intellectual <UNK> , live and die by <UNK> ."
"what does all this say about our society ,"
"are we missing something , <UNK> of <UNK> , hearing the call of god and just not getting it ."
the biggest problem is the self - centered me mentality .
"i am special , i can live forever , god loves me , i am right ."
maybe to buy your child better books or <UNK> to give them a better shot at making the world better .
"oooh wait , wait maybe you can donate it to a <UNK> group to help those you have n't thought of ."
"notice what religion promise ; <UNK> to the poor , <UNK> to the stressed , knowledge to the ignorant ."
"as i have said before , we mock all <UNK> but our own ."
"turn that <UNK> wit your minister , preacher , priest , or high - priest taught you and look back at your beliefs ."
"do n't get mad , we 've all been <UNK> at <#> point in our lives ."
"nothing hurts more than the truth , even if you 're not willing to accept it ."
like when homer was working on a flat tax proposal and accidentally discovered there 's no god .
when he gave it to <UNK> and he double - checked the work it was air tight ..... so he burned it to not let it get out .
"now go out and help your family , children , and world before all the religions that are said to make men <UNK> each other destroy us all ."
this is really going to get a lot of you <UNK> - up but just read through it all .
the concept of equal <UNK> is an idea of the post - modern <UNK> and liberal politicians of the late 20th century .
to think that we are all equal and have equally <UNK> opinions can be taken to the extreme .
"case in point , <UNK> hitler , there i win ."
but you ca n't use such a drastic example .
"the modern phenomenon of being non - <UNK> , ie "" i 'm ok , you 're ok , "" is part of the problem ."
the moral <UNK> of this world do n't want to be found out or hated the way they were brought up by their parents so decided to change it .
"having an <UNK> , yes even hatred for those morals considered <UNK> wrong keeps the balance ."
now that that s out of the way .
cultural diversity is not the wonderful <UNK> thing it 's made out to be .
"the <UNK> of women , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , honor <UNK> , claiming <UNK> for criminal defense all fall under this subject ."
the western ideal has made the world what it is .
"alright liberals say it , "" yes , look at the world ."
""" ok lets , every year the average life span goes up ."
we have <#> % fewer <UNK> and <#> % more food .
"freedom of religion , any religion is a rare thing in these cultures yet common to us ."
the <UNK> theory has saved the lives of countless millions .
"<UNK> have all but been <UNK> along with slavery , child labor , and divine <UNK> ."
all the nations who have <UNK> themselves in the last <#> years have done so using the western ideal and <UNK> it to whatever ethnic <UNK> their country has .
"what are the problem cultures , <UNK> islam , asian <UNK> , central - american <UNK> ."
some claim a democracy but underneath hide their true nature .
"understand something , this is not a racial argument but a cultural <#> ."
europe had its share of savage cultures as well .
in the west we have our problems but our culture has a history of calling out and addressing the problem .
"the message , though once <UNK> applied , has been extended to all ."
the <UNK> do n't even have the message much less the desire to apply it .
then lets all get over it and live together to try to make a better world .
we have the potential to make the most productive and powerful world man has known .
the conviction to win a war has never run along party lines but has been a matter of conviction on the part of those who <UNK> the conflict .
every major conflict of the last <#> years has had some <UNK> pulling strings from the rear that affect the lives of those on the ground .
clear agenda based on total victory is the sure way to keep soldiers alive in battle .
"when a martial artist is trying to break a board with his hand , he <UNK> through the board focusing his energy behind it ."
if he has his <UNK> point on the board the slightest <UNK> can cause injury .
a half - hearted approach or a plan that does not have total destruction of the enemy in mind will cause unnecessary deaths on all sides .
we had an incident in a <UNK> where it was being used as an observation and listening post by the enemy .
our <UNK> to enter the <UNK> was based on some <UNK> of the <UNK> convention . by waiting for the iraqi national guard to come and clear the <UNK>
several <UNK> escaped out the back as seen by the residents of the neighborhood .
now those men are running free and may kill more .
"for those of you not in the know , the <UNK> harbor terrorists in some parts of the city so they are no longer non - <UNK> ."
"if you want me to do my job , do n't ask me how i do my job ."
bear with the title and these first few lines .
"a few years ago i had a discussion with a few <UNK> friends about time travel and <UNK> , <UNK> being disorder in a system ."
when you go back in time ( <UNK> ) your presence would change things thereby it would change the world you return to .
my point was that it would only change the world as you know it .
those in this new <UNK> universe would see it as normal so any attempt to change it would destroy their world .
"leading to this , our beliefs are no safer from this <UNK> than <UNK> theory is ."
most people find the belief that fits them best and not by an analysis of facts or what is best for all .
"political beliefs , as religion , come from family or culture and not so much from your true beliefs ."
the last thing you want is to find out your deepest beliefs are based on lies or <UNK> .
"nixon <UNK> had to have been crushed to the point of denial that some hold to this day or justify as "" they all do it . """
clinton supporters ran in <UNK> when the <UNK> <UNK> themselves .
now president bush has his own demons to <UNK> .
"the subject of religion is always <UNK> but how can you laugh at the <UNK> , indians , and <UNK> when you believe the <UNK> <UNK> ."
how about the <#> day creation or the sun stopping in the sky to <UNK> a battle .
"if you are a believer , sorry ."
the beliefs we hold are who we are and no <#> can can change your mind .
but every once in a while we have to ask questions .
i have to say that the reasons we were sent to iraq are in question and if <UNK> was involved we need to know .
this habit of making <UNK> or having beliefs that have not been tried with the <UNK> mind are <#> of the most <UNK> things <UNK> man .
again no <#> wants to learn that their whole intellectual life ( used very <UNK> ) has been for <UNK> .
"the country is rich in history so it gives you a respect for what you see , and a sadness ."
it 's in ruin from years of neglect .
it 's filthy and the smell of human waste is everywhere .
usually you hear <UNK> and <UNK> about <#> - <#> times a day .
"the feeling of not coming home never enters your mind , but is always there ."
the people are nice and friendly but <UNK> at the same time .
every <UNK> you run into <UNK> himself as such and thanks you for <UNK> them of saddam .
you quickly learn to hate the american media .
luckily the children have no idea how poor they really are .
dead bodies are not as wierd as they once were .
you get smokes are $ <#> a pack .
"yes they drink , smoke , and have dozens of porn theaters here ."
"all the children wave and smile , some ask for money ."
the spirit - crushing <#> degree heat is everywhere even in air - conditioned rooms .
sometimes you feel like you 're baking in your clothes .
you wear about <#> lbs of gear in this heat and a weapon .
"the first time you lock - and - load your weapon and do n't get nervous you get scared , you have just become <UNK> ."
when your vehicle gets hit by an rpg you have to take a second to realize what happened .
<UNK> are louder and sound different than in the movies .
you 'd be surprised what you can sleep through .
you 'd be surprised what you find funny now and what really pisses you off .
you now know how trivial every complaint you ever had is .
"you know how much you really like or dislike certain people , and how much you love others ."
mostly you find out what your made of and many are made of shit .
you love america but have contempt for those still there partying and acting like assholes .
"you hate your enemy , he is a killer of his own people and has no <UNK> because "" god "" told him to do it ."
"you fill your heart with hate so you can kill him and come home to your family , and hope his death will save a family here ."
you do n't fucking know and until you man - up and come over here
mostly you look at it as a really cool job that every guy who sees a movie thinks he can do but does n't .
"you are now a part of history , you want to go home but are proud you were here ."
"no matter who you are or what age ask yourself this ; "" who 's generation is most significant . "" everyone answered mine ."
"i have been hit by rpg 's , small - arms , and <#> <UNK> shells buried in the road and the paint was n't <UNK> ."
"our new <UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> , is far superior to anything i have used in the field ."
remember i first went through basic in <#> then again in <#> so i see the difference .
this unit does nothing but urban warfare something that did n't exist when i went through <UNK> school .
"all the weapons have <UNK> - lights for clearing rooms , <UNK> <UNK> to use at night and <UNK> - sights to sight in easier ."
it <UNK> every time i read that rag .
"no matter who you are you feel you music is best , your movie is best , your car , your tv show ."
we have an emotional attachment to these things .
"first kiss , first car , first r - rated movie , whatever ."
"new is not bad as change , when needed , is not bad ."
"change for the sake of change is dangerous , but new ideas and concepts are what drives this world to strive for the better things ."
that rag would <UNK> me when i would read it .
then the <UNK> <UNK> argument would hit me and calm me down .
their <UNK> is ' <UNK> freaks so appeal to them .
"next time you hear that old fart talk about his day and his music , remember you will , or already do , the same thing ."
why do n't you all f - f - f - fade away .
<#> of the funniest things about the <UNK> here is just how <UNK> they really are .
"americans are dying , yes , but at what rate compared to the states and to what end ."
since the big attack on <#> june we have heard near nothing from the resistance fighters .
considering the <#> hour <UNK> we gave them and the bags they went home in i can understand .
"but what are they fighting , an occupation or the big boy on the block ."
now the politics of the war aside the country is free have found that the general population of this country is happy about it .
the <UNK> party is gone and are playing it smart by <UNK> .
if there 's <#> thing the rich and <UNK> know how to do is stay rich and <UNK> .
"what we are fighting now are <UNK> <UNK> who want a new iran , and <UNK> ."
when we find a weapons <UNK> in a house it 's not <UNK> .
"a few <UNK> , <UNK> , a <UNK> or <#> , maybe an rpg ."
all this leads me to our country and the myth of the anti - war movement .
"what is your typical anti - war <UNK> ; white , rich , in college , and young ."
"what are they <UNK> , the death of soldiers , no ."
"how about innocent civilians , no , the terrorists killed <#> times more than we ever will ."
"the environmental impact , no this country was a <UNK> when we got here ."
i guess the fact that now there is no draft just kills the main focus of the ' <UNK> argument .
"so what is it , a need to belong to something . here in iraq"
"the majority of the <UNK> are <UNK> who were the <UNK> group amongst the <UNK> , now they have their chance to make a name for themselves ."
"in america the <UNK> of the major universities are a haven for <UNK> , innocent minds who have never had a part in anything significant in their lives ."
when you strike out on your own you become exposed to things and places that never would have come into your <UNK> life .
once the <UNK> wears off though you find that the black and white is not as <UNK> or the grey not as complex as you once thought .
"we are the good guys , terrorists and <UNK> are the bad guys ."
"they kill civilians , their own people , their police , their army , and destroy their homes ."
"they hate the big boy , they have a voice now ( given by the big boy ) , and they want to say "" i was there . """
so remember when you 're in your speech class and that <#> guy
<#> of the <UNK> things in this country ( iraq ) is that the people have no clue what freedom of anything is .
"yes they are proud and are slowly learning not to behave so <UNK> , but the last <#> or so years have been under a <UNK> or <UNK> rule ."
this hits close to home for me because my family escaped cuba and ran at all speed to the u.s .
starting in <#> the last of my family came in <#> .
so helping these people begin their lives and nation <UNK> is very exciting and depressing . depressing because i see americans not aware of their fortune in this world .
"the <UNK> person in america has food , a home , electricity , most have cars ."
"so what is my complaint , you are to comfortable ."
"you complain about the drive - thru , the cable tv reception , ca n't find your damn $ <#> <UNK> in blue , and voting ."
dozens of countries around the world have had <UNK> to do the same thing you complain about doing once a year .
i can bet most of you would not die for the right to vote .
i have n't seen many of you here .
how can you talk about a place or an experience that you have never experienced .
"i had a t - shirt when i was in korea that said "" korea , if you ai n't been there shut the fuck up . """
everyone will tell you how bad korea is and have never been there .
before you start to complain or talk about something get all sides .
i swear to god when i get home the first person i hear complain about not having enough ice in their coke is getting laid out .
you people better start looking at he rest of the world and seeing how lucky you all are or you will wind up like this place .
"what am i worried about , american <UNK> getting their news from the big screen <UNK> that is michael moore ."
"i have no love for president bush , he is the kind of big money republican that gives republicans a bad name , but ."
anyone that allows their brains to be pumped full of the <UNK> nonsense that <UNK> .
<UNK> out deserves the fucked up country he 's telling them they have .
"all of the film is <UNK> , "" what i think "" , and coincidence ."
the worst part of it is that the <UNK> are not backed up with evidence to support his story .
"a lot of "" what do you think of ... "" if these things are true then we need to know the truth ."
right now though i do n't hear of <#> minutes or <#> doing a story on the facts of <UNK> .
he fills the screen with images of dead children and civilians .
all the footage of soldiers in iraq shows us as <UNK> rock and roll assholes who want to burn iraq to the ground .
"we all commit war crimes and <UNK> prisoners , according to the film . """
"an <UNK> war leads to <UNK> behavior "" <UNK> from the film , so we are <UNK> hmm ."
every shot is of a <UNK> american soldier <UNK> the civil rights of some poor iraqi civilian who just wanted to live in the loving shadow of saddam hussein .
i do n't know what part of iraq <UNK> .
was in but almost every iraqi i have spoken to is unbelievably happy we came and <UNK> saddam . the same argument about the peace - loving people of vietnam
was used to cover all of them not just the true peace - loving people .
michael moore <UNK> uses the mother of a dead soldier to hang herself on a cross ( <UNK> ) in this film .
he was a grown - ass man who made the decision to join ( at her <UNK> ) and serve his country .
when you join the military you lose all bitching rights .
"i have been doing this on and off since <#> and guess what like the man said "" this is the life we have chosen . """
the display of this woman 's emotion is heart - <UNK> unless you 're a complete bastard but that was his choice .
all the joe 's here are really pissed at this <UNK> in the film and want to say something to someone .
needs to temper his anger with a little <UNK> .
you ca n't support the troops and hate what we do at the same time .
iraq is free and they love us for it .
"i know you will hate this line but i am not hitler ; the end <UNK> the means , iraq is free and they are happy ."
anyway my first memory is completely <UNK> and really frightening .
"she was a very <UNK> person who 'd had <#> children , <#> of whom she buried ."
"when i <UNK> this memory to her she just very matter of <UNK> said , "" yes , that 's right ."
"it was good to have her confirm my memory , but even better to move it from the realm of horror to that of fact ."
my next memory is of bo ’s birth .
"probably i took it on myself , because i liked it when dad smiled his rare smile and i felt that this might do it ."
"i recall running down the road to catch him riding the horse home , then looking up at him and saying importantly , "" you have a son ."
i remember how his face was lost in the haze of the sun behind him and i could n't tell if he smiled or not .
"after that , i have no more <UNK> memories ."
"it ’s funny - i almost forgot to mention my own birth memories which , of course , are borrowed ."
my mother was <#> and my father <#> - <#> .
"he must have taken her to the <UNK> , but he wasn’t there during my birth ."
"after he 'd seen me he was <UNK> to write his in - laws , “ she looks like a monkey ."
"” he also <UNK> , “ <UNK> has plenty of milk , more than the other women in her ward ."
"” i like to <UNK> , even from this distance of time , in the reflected glow of his pride as <UNK> in that letter ."
"anyway being young and <UNK> , my mother did n't really have a strong grasp of how her baby should look and act ."
"” she told me that there was dismay and <UNK> throughout that hospital , from the <UNK> to the highest ."
"you see , i had a <UNK> <UNK> ."
so much for the good cow and the proud father .
you know - i reckon that 's why i 'm always hungry .
"well , it seems a reasonable theory , except that it conflicts with my earlier stated belief that we are who we are before we 're born ."
from an early age until my late teens my father and i regularly went to war with each other .
"and i mean real war with real weapons , <UNK> and kicks that really hurt and made us both cry - but never in front of each other ."
"our anger could take either <#> of us across a room , and over the top of whoever or whatever was between us . similarly and <UNK>"
"bo and i fought for <UNK> - me , the <UNK> ( oldest child ) and he , the <UNK> ( oldest son ) ."
thank god our mum was both a <UNK> and a <UNK> between and for us all .
my mum also took the <UNK> of a lot of my anger and frustration at dad and the double standards he <UNK> practiced between his sons and daughters .
"hers was a <UNK> ( an <UNK> christian religion ) home which <UNK> <UNK> values in the <#> children , of which she was the oldest ."
yet home was also where she increasingly saw alcohol and jealousy - <UNK> <UNK> between her parents .
mum 's never been so much as <UNK> in her entire life .
she tells us now that she was completely blown away by her in - laws with whom she lived the early years of her marriage .
a large and <UNK> <UNK> who were <UNK> of difference yet <UNK> of and <UNK> towards <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> .
"they were <UNK> <UNK> of all sorts of <UNK> characters and could be <UNK> violent , but they were never <UNK> ."
they were all physically attractive and both <UNK> and loud in their conversations .
they were accidently <UNK> and hosted huge and lengthy parties that were often <UNK> by drunken <UNK> which left holes in the walls .
the supreme fact of the matter is that we have ( all of us ) come to love each other without condition or understanding . every now
"and then we 'll take a stab at the latter , but it 's a <UNK> really ."
"at almost <#> , i 've still got them all - mum , dad , <UNK> , pat , bo , john , <UNK> & aaron ."
"we 've all gathered others ( <UNK> , <UNK> , friends , enemies ) and had experiences that have added to the <UNK> ."
"i guess they each have their own angles , takes and beliefs on the family ."
but these and all subsequent postings are my memory and my <UNK> .
"urllink <#> : me , pat , <UNK> , mum holding john , dad , bo - at the <UNK> school <UNK> ."
"during lunch <UNK> asked me to show him how to play , so i took my best deck and cut it in half and gave it to him ."
in <#> turns he had me to <#> life points on the 4th turn he had me at <UNK> life points ... ouch !
guess my deck is in need of a little <UNK> up from quick damage attacks ... acid
i 'll write more as things happen ... acid
lets see i 'll tell you a little bit about myself and introduce you to our cast of characters .
"i 'm <#> , i grew up in a little town called <UNK> , ohio ."
"anyways , i currently work in a web development firm for the <UNK> industry ."
here are the people in my life right now ...
( names changed to keep this safe ... ) mom
<UNK> ( <UNK> niece ) lives with us.. needs to stop smoking and needs to see drinking and driving is bad ...
hope you like this if you have any questions about me let me know ... acid
i stopped by <UNK> brothers <UNK> to be nice to my coworkers got <#> <UNK> and <#> large <UNK> <UNK> ...
i love their strawberry cream cheese their <UNK> tea seems <UNK> down .
oh well guess they ca n't be great at everything ... acid
i have to say that day <#> is easier again .
the evenings are harder than at work in the day .
"i did get a bit restless , but nothing more than that ."
it was n't the first thing i thought of this morning !
"i realy feel as if i have cracked it , but find that hard to believe ."
"i always used to smoke alot at the pub , and my drinking buddy is a <UNK> <UNK> ."
"he knew i was stopping , but i have n't seen him since i did ."
"if anybody does read this and is thinking about stopping smoking , the <UNK> <UNK> method realy does work , and it is realy easy ."
"i have had <#> of <#> slight problems , but they <UNK> only slight ."
nothing compared to the problems you face every day as a <UNK> .
the <UNK> are less <UNK> and just appear as a sort of nervous energy which must be burnt off .
i think this is where the sex comes in .
i noticed today that eating <UNK> does n't help .
"when you stop smoking , the craving first <UNK> itself as a constant need for something ."
"it leaves you feeling empty , so i tried eating <UNK> ."
"this did n't take the feeling away , only kept them alive ."
there are <#> ways for the feelings to go away . <#> .
"this will make the feeling go away instantly and return in less that <#> minute after <UNK> that tab , or <#> . stop smoking ."
"this feeling should go away in <#> days or so , and it is my third day , and the feeling is there , but much <UNK> than before ."
i am eating more but i do n't think it helps .
"i will try and continue my diet tommorow , well , the rest of today ."
"it does n't make the <UNK> of the cigarettes any easier or harder , so why bother ."
"this is my 5th day without a tab , and i feel great !"
i even ran a little bit when i was caught in the rain and my lungs did n't feel like they were burning !
what is hard to <UNK> out is why it is so easy to give up ?
"why did i smoke for all those years when i could n't afford it , while my health was <UNK> ?"
"i will maybe post again if i run into problems , but i ca n't see why i would ."
"i do n't smoke , and i feel <UNK> great about it ."
"took katie to the dentist a couple of weeks ago and they did the normal <UNK> on her teeth , it was time ."
i take all my kids to a <UNK> dentist he is a little less stressful for them .
get this he has a wide screen tv playing cartoons on cartoon network <UNK> and get this they can still watch tv as they are getting their teeth cleaned .
i wish i had it that good when i was growing <UNK>
"i did find out though that katie 's adult teeth is growing in <UNK> and <UNK> , showed up on the <UNK> <UNK> ."
the dentist told me he is hoping that this will <UNK> out before she <UNK> her baby teeth or she might need braces .
but he said not to worry that the teeth might <UNK> out in time .
katie had her <#> t ball game today and it is kinda funny .
nothing like a bunch of <#> year old having no idea what they are doing .
i got to coach <#> base line today and i enjoyed that alot .
tomorrow is carpet cleaning day here at the house .
"i had to call in the "" da boys "" from a place from fiber tech to suck every stinky spot out of my carpet ."
so i have been moving furniture for <#> days .
so i was able to get things taken care of the house like the carpet cleaning .
that is about it maybe i can get on this later .
well jen wants a class ring and we both need more clothes .
"well , maybe that 's not all : dvd writer video editing software wireless data access point for the laptop to be <UNK> in rooms other than the office ."
i am really trying to determine whether being in school is worth <#> more years of nights and weekends of studying .
the entry level <UNK> here are the same level as i am .
probably by the time i get my degree i will be making as much as i would over there .
"well , it will be portable in case we move , but we are thinking of putting in a swimming pool ."
"if we do that , we need to be here for a while to get our money 's worth out of it ."
a swimming pool would be nice for entertainment and exercise .
i think we might glass it in and have it heated
so that we could use it year - round .
that would be a great way to exercise if we would do it .
"if we do n't use it , well that 's money down the drain ."
"i do n't know what i will put in this blog , but have been interested in starting <#> ."
"today , well , i am working at <UNK> as an <UNK> <UNK> ."
jennifer starts her job tomorrow as a <UNK> designer .
me working toward my master 's degree and jen about to get her bachelor 's degree next spring .
"this will really help our <UNK> a lot , but it will take a little while for us to get back on our feet ."
we 've been spending too much money these days .
having to buy new clothes and car tags and my medical bills .
when i write i feel like a urllink charlie parker or urllink jimmy smith solo .
"my mind <UNK> along , fingers trying to keep up , each letter jumping in line with the next until the pages are full and i feel spent ."
i do n't care much for the daily entries of people 's life .
i have enough of my own life to live and wade through .
"i also do n't have the time for the <UNK> lack of quality that <UNK> most on , and off , line writing ."
only then will the use of language come back to the very people who need it most .
if we are becoming more and more dependent on text then we should <UNK> in its joys and drink deeply from its <UNK> of form and function .
"that is what i intend to do , making as few spelling and <UNK> errors along the way ."
i have to gear up to write more each day .
i have a short story idea that i want to finish up .
"i have earlier <UNK> , but they really suck , so i am going to start fresh ."
should be good because it has urllink nazis and urllink <UNK> ! !
i 'm still not sure why i even got <#> of these blog pages .
i really do n't have anything to say .
i guess maybe it will get easier with time .
"i 'm <UNK> on having some reviews on here , movies and music , etc ."
h e l l o o o o o o o . . . . .
a n y o n e o u t t h e r e ? ?
but i guess we will see how it goes .
i 'm still not <#> % sure of what i will publish on this site ...
things i want to know : <#> ) wtf is wrong with this place ?
<#> ) why do you continually piss me off each and every time i try to get to my blog ? <#> )
when am i going to find someplace else ? ?
* <UNK> * not that i am not <UNK> enough already today .
i 'm so sleepy thanks to a certain someone who kept me up well past my bedtime last night ( you know who you are :p ) .
but i am sleepy . going to bed right after i watch the sox tonight
"well , unless someone beans eric <UNK> and gives him a <UNK> or some <UNK> ."
then i 'll be up partying all night :d god
you do not shove jason <UNK> and expect not to make my list .
omg ..... my son has learned to swim .
good god he surprised the shit out of me this weekend !
we went to my sister 's down in massachusetts for the 4th .
last time i watched this kid try to swim was mid - june
.... he was getting it but not quite there .
"jumped right into the over - his - head water and away he went , swimming from <#> side of the pool to the other .... under water even ."
if you know my kid .... you know the whole <UNK> thing - huge deal .
* * proud mommy * * i totally forgot the kid was due at summer school today too ...
he goes <#> weeks a summer to get help with his reading .
"anywho , i totally forgot that he was supposed to start today and i never sent him ...."
he 's with his aunt all day at my nephew 's track meet .
i 'm at work and i am caught up and bored as shit .
i have a * huge * project to start that 's not a big priority so of course .... i do n't want to do it lol .
i guess i should tho ... they do pay me .
i think i 'll check my email first tho ....
then maybe my <UNK> .... make a phone call ....
<UNK> ! went and got a <UNK> combo and a new cal king mattress today !
", i started strong but fatigue hit me at some point ."
i think the problem is i need to eat right before i go to these things since the food prep takes hours and i 'm <UNK> .
"by the time some food was ready , i was too weak to fight the crowds to get a plate of food ."
<UNK> brought me some of anthony 's corn on the <UNK> ( yum ! ) and i snuck some potato and mac salad from the kitchen .
that gave me enough strength to walk to the car so <UNK> and <UNK> and i could go home .
<UNK> was n't feeling well either last night .
"it 's been awhile , has n't it ?"
"the name "" the <UNK> <UNK> "" was given to me by dave <UNK> ."
"if you see him , you can ask him to explain what it means ."
i 'm told he also does a good <UNK> of me .
"if you ask him , he 'll probably do that , too ."
"the <UNK> <UNK> stands for "" fort worth arts collective ."
""" right now , the <UNK> is a body that exists mainly in the minds of tony <UNK> , jordan <UNK> , joe <UNK> , and myself ."
"we all know that fort worth has experienced tremendous growth in the last <#> years : we 're now bigger than boston , seattle , d.c ."
the same <UNK> data shows that the city is <UNK> people in the <UNK> age <UNK> .
"that'd be the <UNK> that supports live music , by and large -- which would account for <UNK> attendance at live shows over the past few seasons ."
"at the same time , you see random events like last year 's jazz by ( near ?"
fort worth 's always been a town with a built - in ( and highly <UNK> ) <UNK> complex .
the time to start changing that is now .
"what we have in mind is not to create some kind of bullshit elite "" in - group , "" or <#> or <#> <UNK> media "" stars ."
""" rather , we 're interested in promoting an environment where musicians , artists , etc ."
", can have <UNK> careers practicing their craft over their <UNK> ."
"finally , we want to be able to speak with <#> <UNK> voice to the people in city government , the chamber of commerce , etc ."
", who have the resources to promote the city 's music scene to the world at large ."
"our first <UNK> will be fairly <UNK> , designed to generate a lot of input and get as many ideas as possible on the table ."
then we can <UNK> decide a ) if this idea is worth pursuing and b ) what form and direction it should take .
"come ready to listen and be respectful of others ideas , as well as presenting as many of your own as possible ."
i hope to make a daily commentary and celebrate at the end with a victory for lance in le tour .
"with <UNK> out of gas , and <UNK> all but across the line , there 's lance with <#> last big burst to steal the win ."
"it 's to bad that lance could n't have <UNK> on the <UNK> with him today , because he deserves the win ."
lance is back in yellow and fixing to put a major beat down on the <UNK> .
just finished listening to the interview of robin williams on <UNK> .
"he has gotten to ride in the team car <#> years in a row , now ."
"tt tomorrow , i think i want to watch it ."
"the french do love to see their <UNK> do well on <UNK> day , same as we love it when the americans ride well on july 4th ."
"i think it was lance 's stage win on july 4th , ' <#> ( fact checking now , nope , it was july 3rd ) ."
"so , they must be doing <UNK> over there to have <UNK> win the stage in such driving style and also have <UNK> holding the yellow jersey yet again ."
i guess we 'll have to wait until friday to see the <UNK> really crack .
it must have been amazing to see the pack catch the <#> lead <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the end .
what i am always most struck by are the camera angles and <UNK> .
"when <UNK> won the other day , the camera at street level facing the <UNK> did not show the difference in distance between him and <UNK> ."
you could not really see how fast <UNK> was moving until they showed the <UNK> from overhead .
"tomorrow , though , they separate the <UNK> from the <UNK> , as it were ."
"with <#> <UNK> <UNK> and the longest stage distance of the tour , i predict we will see some movement at the top ."
"i do n't look for lance to go off the front , but he will be <UNK> in anyone that <UNK> him , for sure ."
"big spill at the end of today 's stage , but everyone seems ok ."
the french have to be thrilled to see their national champion in yellow for a 2nd day in a row .
"france has n't had a tour winner since <#> , but i am curious as to how many stages a <UNK> has held the yellow jersey in recent years ."
i am still looking for the site that can tell me that .
"the next couple of days are still relatively flat , though the road is starting to point up ."
"by next wednesday , the <UNK> and the <UNK> will be <UNK> , the <UNK> are looking quite vertical this year ."
"then answer is , the <UNK> can make up <#> km for every minute of the break ."
"had there been anyone in the break today that the <UNK> were worried about , they would have had to spend <#> 's of the stage chasing the break ."
"fortunately , there was no <#> that <UNK> lance with their climbing ability , so the break held ."
"so , there you go , learned something about tactics today ."
"<#> of the top <#> <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> , outstanding ."
", they wo n't sweat it much , but look to him to stay in yellow if it suits their strategy of holding off the real mountain threats ."
"as expected , the first couple of stages are dominated by the <UNK> ."
just glad to see teh team keeping lance safe and letting the rest of the pack fight it out for <UNK> points .
tomorrow 's <UNK> should be very <UNK> : tomorrow ? ?
"as always , i am sure the <UNK> ( what will we call them next year ?"
the <UNK> ? ) will be strong and not let anyone get out too far .
"i am sure if the conditions are right , they will go for a win ."
"<UNK> , i thought our boy was going to pull off that win ."
"how great was it for that guy , <UNK> to put up such a huge time and hold off all those guys ."
i was just glad to see the rain held off .
my biggest fear was bad luck and an injury .
this guy went from <UNK> to <UNK> in <#> hours .
i think he 's <UNK> going to be a huge challenge this year .
... it 's going to be fun <#> weeks .
"having a little <UNK> of the news sites for the <UNK> , everyone seems confident that lance will take the race ."
"i too , feel that way , but we all know , it is a long race and a lot can happen ."
"remember , tyler hamilton broke his collar bone last year , early ."
he will be a <UNK> competition to lance . especially on the <UNK> <UNK> time trial .
"that will be amazing , and i will probably have to watch it live ."
"tomorrow 's time trial is a <UNK> , <#> km ."
"i think lance will be in the top <#> , and maybe win , depending on the weather ."
"if it 's slick and rainy , he 'll stay safe ."
"so , finally , my prediction for the tour , lance will win with at least a <#> min margin , total ."
"if he loses , my blame will be place <UNK> on the shoulders of <UNK> <UNK> , and the definition of "" <UNK> "" will be complete ."
"( needless to say , this belief of mine <UNK> my wife , a bit ) ."
i will be at scott and <UNK> 's to watch .
"lance takes off last , so that should be some time around <UNK> central time ."
"very excited for this weekend , it will be the perfect pool , bbq , <UNK> , <UNK> weekend ."
i just signed up for this service in order to record and share thoughts on my trip .
i am going to europe from <#> until <#> with plans for lots of fabulous adventures .
but for now i just want to see how this thing works .
"it 's so hot here , i can hardly think , but i will try to write something since i am at a computer ."
i 'm here in this medium - sized spa town in western <UNK> .
"steve very kindly looked up a hostel for me to call when i got here , but unfortunately it was full ."
"this is a lovely little place which reminds me of <UNK> , or ."
"tall , beautiful buildings line a little river with lots of <UNK> areas and bridges across ( but no <UNK> on the streets ) ."
"i tried the healing water , and it tasted horrible and made me cough , which i think is the idea ."
"here , everything is in german and czech , not english ."
"i went to the museum , but since i do n't know either of those languages , i did n't learn much ."
"i did , however , take some cool pictures of the light <UNK> ."
but the show must go on . in a minute
", i 'll see if i can swim in the pool ."
my last night in <UNK> was very nice .
i met steve in a beer garden near the center and watched the light fade blue and the red moon rise above the <UNK> <UNK> city .
"i ordered grilled salmon , which came with grilled veggies as well and totally rocked ."
the waiter kept bringing us beer because we did n't ask him to stop .
since i 've been in europe i find i sleep really well after a beer or so .
"so , i bought a bus ticket to <UNK> <UNK> ( charles 's hot spring ) , a spa town in western <UNK> , leaving tomorrow morning ."
i have chosen this place because my <UNK> says it has a nice <UNK> swimming pool open to the public .
the spa is n't really available to the general public ( only for those with a doctor 's <UNK> ) .
i might go to <UNK> <UNK> in germany next bc the general public actually can enjoy the spa there ( assuming they can afford it ) .
"however , i am a little worried about finding a place to stay on a saturday ...."
steve says that <UNK> of the cows has been a problem .
"there are <UNK> i have noticed at bus stops that probably say something like "" <UNK> of the cows is a national <UNK> ."
the city <UNK> it green immediately the next morning .
"so , <#> of the cows is by the same artist and he painted it pink with a symbol of a tank on it ."
"this cow was <UNK> , which may indicate that the <UNK> is politically motivated ."
[ see steve 's comment re : this issue below .
i went to the 17th century <UNK> <UNK> south of the center .
"there is a gorgeous church and <UNK> there , and the edge of the <UNK> is a park with a view of the city and river ."
the <UNK> was also beautiful in similar ways including lovely <UNK> .
i took pictures so i can show you later .
"then i <UNK> back towards the center , enjoying seeing the "" real <UNK> "" away from all the crowds ."
"sometimes life throws you many curves , twists and turns"
... we were thrown a curve recently and we had to make a life <UNK> and final decision .
i had twins several years ago almost <#> now to be exact .
my body like my mind must 've been in shock for the last <#> years because the medical world told me that it was impossible to have more children .
that <UNK> because i was young and my husband younger .
fast forward to <#> weeks ago .... my husband tom
and i were watching <#> and <#> <UNK> <UNK> is going to have a <UNK> ...
"we laughed at the humor , the next night it was according to jim the same subject ...."
we laughed again and <UNK> said how we did n't have to worry about that ....
next day 's doctor 's appointment i wake up from the dream .... and
so you know the saying watch what you wish for ... they forget to add that you will get it but it may take <#> years !
"now we have to make "" the "" decision ."
"we talk , we talk some more , i offer to have the surgery he offers to have the big "" v "" , we talk some more ."
"i glance down at my "" sister "" with the <#> month old twins and she 's bouncing <#> on her lap and rocking the other in the <UNK> ..."
<#> of us will have surgery but which <#> .
"if something happens to me he "" could "" have more children with someone else ... if something happens to him ..."
well i 'm too old now so i 'm the logical choice .
have you ever looked at someone and in <#> moment loved them more than you ever thought possible .
my husband would n't hear of me having surgery because it is easier on him than on me .
he made the appointment and said it was a done deal .
if i did n't already know how much he loves me i knew at that moment .
"he would do anything for me even having his "" <UNK> "" cut upon ."
the next few weeks were filled with jokes and poking fun all the while i was so proud of him and felt like the <UNK> woman alive .
so now it 's my turn at the humor and comedy ...
"i try to talk him into selling his "" <UNK> "" afterall after the surgery is done ...."
i tease him <UNK> about it ... all the while i 'm so proud and lucky ...
"i name all the things that we can get for his "" <UNK>"
""" he does n't see the humor as he <UNK> each time i tease him ...."
"i keep it up because it is so rare that "" i "" get <#> over on him ... and yes i enjoyed teasing him very very much ."
"we go the night before to the "" city "" where the "" deed "" will be done ."
we check in to the hotel and head out to dinner .
we choose a japanese <UNK> ... after a buddha or <UNK> good <UNK> <UNK> irony hits me and i ca n't stop laughing ...
i tease him and say the japanese cook works at the restaurant part time ...
"his "" real "" job is to do the big "" v "" at the hospital that is actually next door ."
we laugh so hard i 'm almost in tears and he says well i 'll be alright tomorrow unless i hear the sound of those knives .
a <UNK> <UNK> here a <UNK> <UNK> there here a <UNK> there a <UNK> ...
the deed is <UNK> are handed a <UNK> jar and sent on our way .
so off we go ... we shop and then go to <UNK> for lunch ...
i figure he deserves the scenery after what he has done for me .
"a dear friend told me that "" you and tom "" always have so much <UNK> getting a <UNK> you make fun ..."
well i 'm not real sure just how much fun it was for him . ....
i guess <UNK> suffering from a bad case of middle age blues .
all those middle age cliche crisis are beginning to <UNK> me .
why am i constantly dissapointed with myself and life in general ?
why does my hair fall out of my head only to return on my back and in my ears ?
when am i going to feel like the confident well adjusted grown up i assumed <UNK> become ?
"it seems to me , and this is only my perspective , that the older i get the more <UNK> i get ."
"the lot i have achieved in life is <#> of <UNK> , achieved through a lifetime of fear , <UNK> , obligation , responsibility and <UNK> expectations ."
"i have no use for an abundance of material <UNK> , its the emotional aspects of my life that need <UNK> ."
"what drives me is an urgent desire for adventure , passion , romance , creativity , peace and love ."
at present <UNK> suffering from a pretty bad bout of depression .
"<UNK> getting help and medication in the short term , but what about long term ?"
am i going to come out of this refreshed and <UNK> ?
will it lead to the <UNK> of my marriage ?
"or will i end up divorced , broke , broken , <UNK> , sick or dead ."
"i wonder if anyone is ever going to read this entry , or anything else that i post for that matter ?"
<UNK> because i needed a voice that i just <UNK> have anywhere else .
"<UNK> just a wierd freaky little guy that <UNK> through life feeling pissed off , inadequate and never bothering to do a damned thing about it ."
the place to come and get things off my chest .
1st agenda is to address my current state of mental <UNK> .
for months now <UNK> been feeling that <UNK> on the edge of a total mental crack up .
"tension in my head , neck , back and shoulders ."
"i spend a lot of time on the verge of tears , <UNK> at my inability to connect with other people ."
i have just gotten to a stage where i <UNK> cope with life at all .
"<UNK> concentrate , <UNK> relax , <UNK> do simple chores without <UNK> stuffing them up , <UNK> relax socially ."
in general i <UNK> get any satisfaction out of life at all .
it came to a head this week when i broke down at work .
so now <UNK> on anti - <UNK> and have a few weeks off work to try and sort myself out .
so that was my piece of drama for the week .
"not that this journal is going to be purely <UNK> , more just a sounding board ."
just thought <UNK> share as a means of letting a little of myself out there .
"well , this is a stretch for me- mrs tech - challenged <#> !"
"i must be out of my mind to start this , but then again i have been called crazy more than once in this life !"
i do n't know how much i 'll have to share so bear with me !
i know that i will try not to be unfair to any person in my scope of <UNK> and will not spread gossip or <UNK> anyone !
i only hope i will have something meaningful to say on occasion .
to throw things out there and see who agrees or <UNK> .
""" they have attacked america because we are freedom 's home and <UNK> , and the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our time . """
"- president george w. bush "" they counted on america to be passive ."
"they counted wrong . "" -- president ronald w. reagan we will not forget ."
"<UNK> a group of us marines , kerry , who has made his vietnam war service a <UNK> of his campaign , went over to chat ."
"the marines , who all turned out to be <UNK> bush reporters , were not impressed . """
"he imposed on us and i disagree with him coming over here shaking our hands , "" <#> of them told reporters afterwards ."
""" i 'm <#> percent against "" kerry , he said ."
""" we support our commander - in - chief <#> percent ."
what 's <UNK> to me about lance <UNK> hunt 's sacrifice is what he did in order to become united states marine .
"justin , of <UNK> , ca , was a star athlete in high school , winning <UNK> in wrestling , baseball and football ."
"according to justin 's twin brother , jason , he always wanted to be a marine ."
but when he went to visit marine <UNK> in <#> he was so big they did n't have a scale that would weigh him .
at boot camp he lost another <#> lbs and began to talk about becoming a drill instructor .
while at camp <UNK> he met kerry murphy and the couple made plans to meet each other 's families .
justin also dreamed of going to college and becoming an fbi agent .
"justin 's older brother , robert , is in the us navy <UNK> to the middle east and will accompany his brother home ."
"kerry seems intent on proving that his words and position are determined by whatever the most politically <UNK> course is , a point i made last week ."
in <#> kerry was among other democrats who voted against then - president clinton in <UNK> hiv infected people from <UNK> to the us .
"so , was he saying the <UNK> were <UNK> ? ) now , <#> years later kerry needs votes ."
"saturday he announced he "" will work with congress to lift the immigration ban . """
his reason is so the us can host an aids conference .
i guess this must be a step in his plan to raise our standing in the world .
when questioned yesterday by cnn 's larry king about secretary ridge 's warning of possible attacks by al qaeda john kerry 's response was less than <UNK> .
""" well , i have n't been <UNK> yet , larry ."
the man who wants to lead and protect this nation is too busy to be <UNK> on the latest threats ?
kerry appeared on king 's show just hours before he attended a hate fest <UNK> as a <UNK> .
"john edwards said , "" this campaign will be a celebration of real american values . "" well let 's see about that ."
"what do kerry , the democrats and the left think "" the heart and soul of our country "" are ?"

"edwards said it was "" a great honor "" to be there ."
neither kerry nor edwards <UNK> any <UNK> to any of the <UNK> ' statements .
"why kerry is "" too busy "" for a national security <UNK> ."
"so is that what we consider "" the heart and soul of america "" and "" real american values "" ?"
why are there so many stories the media does n't report ?
they love to beat us down with what they think is the bad news in the war .
i read today that who you think is winning in iraq is determined by who you want to win .
"if that 's so , the media must be on the wrong side ."
otherwise they 'd tell us about jason <UNK> .
on april <#> jason gave the last full measure of devotion when he <UNK> onto a <UNK> to save his friends .
jason had extended his <UNK> so he could remain with his unit through their tour in iraq .
"he told a friend , "" i want to make sure everyone makes it home alive ."
"i want to be sure you go home to your wife alive . ” jason 's father , daniel <UNK> , an air force veteran"
", said , "" jason ’s been my hero since he was born ."
"they never had to do anything to prove that to me . "" follow these links and read about this brave young hero ."
i hope you caught this on the news .
bush knocked <#> out of the park yesterday .
"tuesday i posted a quote where kerry claimed , "" i 'm the only candidate running for president who has n't played games , <UNK> around . """
in fact i think he ca n't help it .
kerry is called a flip - <UNK> or a <UNK> .
he says what he thinks will score him the most points at the time he says it .
he claims to be a catholic and <UNK> a key <UNK> of that faith by his stance on abortion .
this is what he did in his changing support of the war in iraq and other issues .
"kerry knows the vast majority of americans , including women , are against abortion ."
"so he says , "" i believe life does begin at <UNK> . """
but he knows the liberal <UNK> will <UNK> any candidate with such a view .
"so he says it 's personal , and far be it from him to try and impose his beliefs on another ."
"should the rest of the world have turned a blind eye to avoid "" <UNK> our beliefs "" , in kerry 's words ."
politicians like kerry are the reason people do n't trust politicians .
they put there finger in the wind and set their <UNK> to get the most <UNK> toward their goal .
their principles are only as firm and constant as the latest poll results .
"it should , but unfortunately it probably wo n't ."

"of course , by association , they consider everyone who supports the policy of president bush toward iraq and its <UNK> to be "" <UNK> "" too ."

"they want to <UNK> that bush is <UNK> , <UNK> , and dangerous ."
"a real "" shoot first , ask questions later "" <UNK> kind of guy ."
we learned about <UNK> from the lone ranger and john wayne .
we grew up reading louis <UNK> novels and watching marshall matt <UNK> keep dodge city safe .
we grew up <UNK> the american cowboy and all he stands for .
"a cowboy is <UNK> , able to make do and get the job done with the tools at hand ."
he can fix a fence with a piece of <UNK> wire or get water from a <UNK> in the middle of the <UNK> .
"he may be "" rough as a <UNK> "" when the situation calls for it , but he 's gentle and kind with women and children ."
"he says "" sir "" and "" <UNK> . """
his speech may be more plain and simple than some prefer .
"he may say "" folks "" to describe anyone , friend or enemy ."
"he uses terms like "" <UNK> , "" "" dead or alive , "" "" hunt 'em down "" and "" smoke 'em out . """
"he 's a man of few words , but when he speaks his meaning is clear ."
"a cowboy <UNK> the creator and <UNK> the beauty of the creation , but he knows that it was created for mankind to rule over and use ."
"a cowboy has dreams , but he 's also down to earth ."
"a cowboy may have things in his past that he 's not proud of , but he does n't let them control who and what he is ."
"he looks forward to the promise of tomorrow , resolved to be better than he was ."
a cowboy knows the difference between right and wrong .
he also knows that there are good people as well as evil people in this world .
he willingly <UNK> his duty to help and protect the good .
"he will take on any task that is necessary and do a good job , not for recognition or gain , but because someone has to do it ."
"a cowboy is independent yet loyal , free - <UNK> but responsible ."
"he is reliable , honest , and <UNK> ."
a cowboy does the right thing even when it 's not popular and even when no <#> is watching because it is against his very nature to do otherwise .
a cowboy is the <UNK> of all the qualities that have made america the best and greatest nation on earth .
"he is what all good men truly wish to be , in their hearts , whether they are willing to admit it or not ."
i think all those people may be right .
"he did not go looking for this fight , but he will not back down from it ."
we will confront the evil that <UNK> us and we will destroy it .
our enemies will either change their ways or suffer the same fate .
"america has been the world 's <UNK> when "" criminals "" needed to be stopped or brought to justice ."
perhaps now we must be the world 's cowboy and put an end to the <UNK> and <UNK> who threaten <UNK> people .
"regardless of what his critics may say about him , president bush will do the right thing because that is what <UNK> do ."
"perhaps , the next time someone calls president bush a cowboy he should simply smile and politely say "" thank you . """
this is unreal and in my opinion the ones who are asking for this <UNK> into our <UNK> should face public <UNK> and whatever official <UNK> might be available .
"it was published in the <UNK> - sunset <UNK> in <UNK> , texas ."
the <UNK> way to secure peace is to prepare for war .
the only thing that might possibly bring iraq into <UNK> with the will of the world is the threat of destruction .
<UNK> our president as a wild - eyed cowboy itching for a fight will not do it .
"painting hussein as a poor , <UNK> victim of american arrogance will not do it ."
these things only <UNK> his <UNK> and his resolve to delay and resist .
"these things only give him more time and more support to gain the material , technology and <UNK> to threaten the entire world ."
do we really want to wait until he has the upper hand ?
until he can hold the world <UNK> to his will ?
"i can remember when we all lived in fear of a global , nuclear war ."
"i remember what the phrase "" <#> minutes to midnight "" meant ."
i for <#> do n't want to go back there

we saved europe from the <UNK> in world war i. we saved the entire world during world war ii .
"yes , we were part of a great alliance ."
"yes , other countries made significant contributions of lives and <UNK> ."
but the war was definitely going in the favor of the <UNK> powers before we got in the fight .
"europe , asia and much of africa were already <UNK> ."
"england , though fighting <UNK> , could not have held out <UNK> ."
we saved all of asia and the pacific region from japanese <UNK> .

we provided medical equipment and supplies to the <UNK> soviet states .
we conduct <UNK> operations throughout the <UNK> to rid the world of the <UNK> of illegal <UNK> .
these and countless other operations were conducted in the 20th century alone at a cost of millions of our dollars and many thousands of american lives .
none of these were fought so that we could steal oil or <UNK> countries .
they were fought because someone must do the right thing .
"perhaps the germans have forgotten "" operation <UNK> , "" the berlin <UNK> ."
in june <#> the <UNK> blocked all land <UNK> into berlin in attempt to cut off the city and drive out the western powers .
they tried to <UNK> us through the <UNK> of berlin 's citizens .
"between june <#> and september <#> us and british planes delivered <#> <#> tons of food , coal and medicine to the citizens of berlin through <#> flights ."

"an online journal sounds intriguing , if only to keep my thoughts in order ."
i have long ago given up writing in my journal due to the <UNK> <UNK> that is my long hand .
the past few years would have made for some good reading and i will regret not having those thoughts to look back on .
i suppose i have my memory but even that seems to be failing me in my old age or thru all the drama .
drama is n't <UNK> negative but tonight i am wishing for a somewhat drama free past .
"tonight when i scan the postings of my name via the web , i come <UNK> a memorial to him ."
someone in his high school class found out that he is dead and they are looking for stories in regards to their beloved fellow student .
"i sit here , at this desk and the air leaves my chest and is n't replaced for what seems like a great while ."
"i miss him so much , i miss my husband , i miss <UNK> father ."
i do n't laugh so much anymore and i used to live for laughter .
now when i do it seems empty and hollow .
maybe when i laugh again i will feel some connection .
"my <UNK> has been "" it 's ok "" well it fucking is n't ok , far from ok ."
i want to tell people that but when i do they run from me .
"i am <UNK> and you do n't even know it or if you do , you do n't care enough to say a thing ."
stay away and <UNK> will pop back up like a <UNK> peace lily getting a much needed drink .
i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer .
watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly .
i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it .
i have waited for the best ... it is <UNK> me .
"i just want some understanding , a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest ."
where is my <UNK> in the form of a human ?
"maybe it 's because it 's been a bad week already , but i 'm just wondering why things are they way they are ."
"let me vent a little ... for the record , i 'm a <#> year old female running <UNK> into <#> like it was a brick wall ."
"is this normal for the "" <UNK> "" group of my gender ?"
i 've never really given much consideration to age ...
", it 's just a number , right ?"
maybe i 'm just more aware of the focus and it 's always been there ?
i have a son who 's soon to be <#> and heading off to college on the other side of the country in september .
"this is a very emotional thing for me since it 's always been "" him and me "" and now it will be just "" me "" ."
i m messages coming from behind his closed bedroom door at night .
"before that it was a <#> sided "" try "" and i was exhausted from the effort ."
"my ex had done the most <UNK> act of having an affair with my next - door neighbor who just happened to be the <UNK> "" best friend "" ."
that was pretty much the ending point for me .
why waste the effort on someone that wo n't offer the same in return ?
"it 's been rough a few times , but so far i think i can say "" we made it "" ... so far ..."
and we still have a great relationship intact !
once upon a time i had a wonderful job .
"i worked for an internet company during the highlight of the "" <UNK> "" ."
"so that means no overtime pay for the overtime hours i 'm required to put in during those "" times of <UNK> "" ."
i 've been dating my boyfriend for years now .
"that word seems so immature when you 're almost <#> , but "" partner "" reminds me too much of a western !"
"anyhow , he 's a wonderful man with a very kind and caring soul ... until he too fell into a financial <UNK> ."
why do men insist on <UNK> up <UNK> than a virgin 's knees on prom night ?
"hey ... you are n't under "" cave arrest "" ..."
i promise no <UNK> of the ankles or wrists will occur !
just do n't let the relationship become <UNK> .
obviously i do n't know all the answers .
i do n't know how often i 'll have something of interest to post on here .
"all i know is that everyday is just another day , and everyone has their problems and <UNK> to get through ."
"if you have experiences to share , or just <UNK> to do , post a comment !"
"no matter how bad the day seems , it 's just another thread in the <UNK> of life and it too shall pass ."
"it seems like a <UNK> would be a good thing , something to <UNK> the <UNK> on the old <UNK> ."
"tonight , i have abandoned the hope that brian will ever marry me ."
i have abandoned the hope that there will ever be anything more than this .
"i have abandoned this hope before , and now i know what it means for hope to spring eternal ."
"it 's like <UNK> , or building your house on a flood plain ."
"of course , at first , i had some anguish ."
"we were sitting on the couch , and i asked him , "" what have you got against marriage ? "" and he said , "" nothing ."
"and i said , "" but you do n't want to marry me . """
"and he said , "" not right now . """
"and i said , "" these things take time to plan . "" and he ( annoyed ) said , "" i know . """
"and then he said , "" look , i 've spent <#> - <#> years thinking that i did n't want to get married , ever ."
"that kind of thinking does n't change overnight . """
"i said , "" well , i understand how you could feel that way , though in my mind , this has n't been an overnight thing . """
and then we just sat on the couch for another <#> minutes .
"he and i , we 're having different relationships here ."
"we do n't have a single , shared experience , but <#> experiences that sort of twist together , but are really , very different ."
"and , i ca n't ever know what his experience is , really ."
"i mean , i get the <UNK> of it , like someone telling you about a movie ."
"but , i do n't get the reality of it ."
and no amount of explaining is going to bring his experience into sharp focus for me .
"the other night , sunday night , we had sex , after a long dry spell ."
"we 've been so busy getting the house ready to sell , and so tired , just sort of falling in bed and falling asleep ."
he knew that i really missed all of it .
"and so , he held me really tight , and he kissed me , and he put his tongue in my mouth , and his tongue is huge ."
"i mean , i could n't turn my head away ."
i had no choice but to open my mouth .
but i did n't know what he was experiencing .
why does n't he take the time to really figure out what i want ?
"so , after this marriage conversation , i went back into the kitchen to finish <UNK> paint off the spice <UNK> ."
"and i realized that we were , again , having different relationships ."
"he may see me as his companion , but he does n't see me as his wife , or even , future wife ."
"my gut reaction , then , is to come back to independence ."
"to abandon hope of marriage , and my own <UNK> , and go back to the wild , and kill my own supper and cook it myself ."
"it feels good , in some ways , to come back to an independent state ."
"but i will miss that feeling of safety , even if it is n't real ."
i do n't think it was before i went to sleep and it was n't quite when i woke up .
it must have been at some point in the middle of the night during <#> of my <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> .
i prayed for god to take away the darkness from within me .
get the devil the heck out of my thoughts .
he 's there ... always challenging me and my thoughts on god and jesus .
"he 's there always tempting me with things i know i should not think , do , say , etc . just get him out !"
i want to commit my life fully to god ...
fully to the good ... fully to the light .
i do long for the day jesus comes to defeat the evil on this world .
i pray for my children that things do n't continue to get <UNK> out there for them .
what kind of world will be waiting for them when they grow up ?
i pray for my children to have a strong relationship with jesus .
they can not depend on my salvation for their own .
i ca n't wait for the day i can sing <UNK> to god for eternity .
"to look over my words here , i think that i might look like a <UNK> ."
god needs more <UNK> out there to share his light and his love .
"prayer topic for today : the church is doing an <UNK> at the fireworks display tonight , handing out cold bottles of water ."
i pray first of all that it does n't rain out the fireworks display !
second of all that the community will receive god 's love through the volunteers who are handing out the water .
i pray that it will bring some closer to god who might be seeking him and not even know it .
"lord , be with me as i go through my day today ."
"help me to make the right choices , say the right things at the right times ."
help me with the <UNK> that i always struggle with .
they did n't seem quite so strong this <UNK> after my prayer last night .
i want to be strong and to play my part in the battle .
thank you for giving my life a purpose .
"with all my heart in jesus ' name , <UNK>"
i woke up this morning with a man on television telling me why it 's a sin to not worship god on sunday .
"but really , does n't god want us to worship him every day , not just sunday ?"
"<UNK> <UNK> keeps singing through my head ... "" let everything that has breath praise god ! """
i want to keep the spirit of praise alive all day long .
i got to work after a week 's vacation and bam !
i was <UNK> as soon as i walked through the door .
sometimes i think i need more than a vacation ...
i need a re - dedication to what i want to do with the rest of my life .
speaking of work - another bad habit fell right back into place as well - gossip .
it 's so easy to fall into its <UNK> .
someone starts <UNK> and my ears immediately <UNK> up .
"i like to think not , but you know it happens everywhere ."
i need to pray for forgiveness and strength to avoid gossip .
i also need strength to stick with my new diet and exercise plan .
it 's not much of a diet and exercise plan if i do n't follow them .
it was stressful enough just going back to work .
you could n't tell by looking at it !
am i trying to take on too many changes at once ?
prayer topic for today is : volunteers in the vacation bible school .
"god , please bless them and the work they are doing with the kids ... with my kids as well ! !"
they love going and are being drawn closer to you in the process .
it takes a special person to have the strength and courage and <UNK> to volunteer to work with tons of kids like that .
to give up their free time in the evenings .
all to show god 's love to the children .
i have the best intentions to start <UNK> and i end up losing the journal .
they 're all buried under books that i 've started reading and never finished .
but then i 'd have all that blank time between the last entry and now .
i thought maybe <UNK> online might make it easier .
"i 'm trying to better my heart through exercise and diet and i 'm trying to better my soul through prayer , <UNK> and reading the bible ."
it 's once you 're a few days into it when things start going <UNK> - <UNK> .
"i plan to journal out my thoughts every day and then spend some time reading the bible , and in prayer ."
i forgot to mention that i <UNK> got up at <#> a.m. this morning to begin this quest .
because i have no other time throughout the day to accomplish this ... and it 's something that i really want to do .
i want to spend this time to sort out my thoughts and get closer to god .
i really thought i had turned it all over to god .
i truly am thankful that he only took what extra i had saved up and did n't touch any that we needed to live off of .
but it 's just so <UNK> unfair that he can get away with it .
"god , i want justice to be served on him ."
that would stop so much evil that 's out there .
i know justice will be served in your time .
i know jesus died on the cross for all of our sins .
"maybe someday before he dies , he will find your way and <UNK> for his wrong - <UNK> ) ."
i also need to pray for my feelings of anger towards him and what he has done .
i spent much of yesterday just thinking about it and even crying a little .
i was <UNK> my frustration on myself and on clark .
help me to just turn it all over to you and to let you deal with it .
i need to hold out hope in this dark world .
"god , help me to be a light , shining your love onto this world ."
"i do n't feel right when i 'm carrying anger , hurt , worry and all those dark feelings around with me ."
help me to shed them and shine your love .
today we start our prayer adventure at church . today i am to pray for the jr .
high ministry team as they guide our early teens into a closer love and relationship with god .
i pray that they are able to show these teens their excitement for god 's love .
high ministry team is blessed through jesus ' name .
"finally , help me to keep you in mind as i go through my day today , lord ."
"well guys and girls , i found the cure for <UNK> loneliness !"
i believe that the only cure for feeling down is hard work :) .
after my rather crappy few days ( so many <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> )
", what 's the catch , no way will i ever be able to get it to work , or it will only be avail to usa residents ..."
finally being so down and only being interested in talking to a few people ( <#> of them were n't even online !
"he was of course off <UNK> at <UNK> , i <UNK> it cause"
", well that 's what i do :-p ) , so i looked in <UNK> ...."
"well say no more , i looked through my <UNK> to see if there was anything interesting there and found this * build a free website thing *"
"i decided to take a look , cause lets face it we already <UNK> much earlier in this blog , how <UNK> i am :-p"
<UNK> ( the link that claimed miracles that were omg actually true )
so after <#> hours work this is what i came up with :d
i do intend <UNK> a domain name in next few weeks and having it changed but hey for a free site i think it is fantastic !
"ok guys , now i sound like a <UNK> lol"
i noticed that <#> individual people have looked at my profile here ?
or is it just the fact that my ramblings are meaningless to you ?
"i managed not to get in the way of anyone 's bad moods , <UNK> out or general <UNK> 's ."
i talked with <UNK> - the most beautiful girl in the world and greg 's gf .
and i basically did nothing all day but work on my site ...
"well technically i did that all last night to , <UNK> do n't tell <UNK>"
( he sent me to bed at <#> am ) ...
got up around <UNK> and have n't even been out of my <UNK> all day !
"so i am feeling pretty lazy right now and sleepy , <#> hours is just not enough for me these days <UNK>"
"<UNK> first of all i’d like to extend my <UNK> thanks to professor <UNK> , mrs ."
"at the same time i would also like to thank the china scholarship council , mr ."
"joan <UNK> , director of the centre for language studies and communication , mr ."
"helen <UNK> , dr . barbara mayor , mrs ."

"i might start a new life when i’m back home with the new knowledge , experience and <UNK> gained here in britain ."
i would really welcome the opportunity to come back to the uk again .
"<UNK> north by election result <UNK> <#> , <UNK> <#> , new lab <#> , <UNK> <#> , <UNK> <#> , <UNK> <#> <#> % <UNK> ."
"this was previously a labour <UNK> , since <#> ."
"i was disappointed in the <UNK> vote , i had expected double ."
the seat however was closely fought and perhaps this has made people more <UNK> .
we do know that we attract from equally from <UNK> and new labour as well as folk who have never voted before .
"the fact that our candidate was not local was an issue , however this should be the last time we have to field someone from <UNK> the area ."
we have managed finally to establish a branch for the <#> towns .
"it rained all day thursday and she got soaked , but i could nt help but remember her parents , both active <UNK> now <UNK>"
", they would have been proud of her ."
we came face to face with the <UNK> candidate at the <UNK> meeting on tuesday night .
"there was about <#> present , when the <UNK> candidate arrived i asked for , and was granted permission to address the meeting ."
i explained that the <UNK> candidate could not <UNK> in the meeting due to the presence of the <UNK> <UNK> .
"i issued a prepared statement <UNK> the <UNK> , and challenged the other candidates present to join me outside where we would be available to speak to <UNK> ."
"he said often , "" i do nt agree with all the <UNK> policies , but .... """
"new labour were <UNK> at losing the seat , they are used to weighing the vote <UNK> , and the <UNK> , a jack glass <UNK> , was delighted ."
a strange result at a strange time . had a superb visit from <UNK> .
"<UNK> cooked a superb <UNK> and a superb chocolate <UNK> , her talents know no <UNK> ."
we enjoyed a superb bottle of <UNK> and a superb <UNK> .
"<UNK> and informative , i 've a better idea of where <UNK> is politically and caught up with other aspects of his life ."
it is nearly <#> years since he left town and it was really really good to see him .
"<UNK> has been doing a good trade in cards , kids are good ."
the sad saga of the broken treadmill has led me to some self - discovery .
"first , i 'm very pleased that i do n't have to pay someone to install the parts into it ."
"second , i 'm proud of myself and my <UNK> in pursuing the repair project through all these many calls ."
it 's annoying but i 'm not letting it stop me .
"third , i 've discovered that i really miss my treadmill ."
i miss being able to walk after work each day .
"of course , it 's <UNK> <#> degrees out there ."
and that 's been the temperature every day lately .
but i 'd get a better walk on the treadmill .
"fourth , in an effort not to be <UNK> in my fitness goals i <UNK> my partner to join the local <UNK> center with me ."
"i think she 's shocked that i would want to do that , since i 've never been very athletic ."
"plus it 's reasonably priced and what we pay helps support the center for everyone . and finally , i got creative today and looked into my college <UNK> ."
and i 've been taking classes there for a couple of years .
it turns out that they have a fitness center on campus .
i 've been struggling with my treadmill for the past <#> weeks .
"i love my treadmill , do n't get me wrong ."
"not very top of the line , but not entry - level ."
"including delivery it was around $ <#> when we bought it , but i digress ."
"so it 's out of <UNK> for labor , but parts are still covered ."
i was pleased to learn they 'd let me install the replacement part myself and save the labor charges .
the tech put me through the <UNK> and concluded that the problem was a bad motor <UNK> board .
this seemed reasonable based on the symptoms i had observed .
"he ordered <#> to be sent to me , which i <UNK> received <#> business days later ."
this was on the weekend of the fourth of july .
installed it . and the problem <UNK> .
i called again this afternoon . at this point
"we have diagnosed the likely problem to be a failed motor , which may be feeding current back to the motor <UNK> board and <UNK> something ."
i am now awaiting the delivery of a motor and a motor <UNK> board . and
today 's tech had the courtesy to upgrade the shipping to ups air so i should have it in hand on wednesday .
and then we shall see if the problem is fixed .
"someone recently said "" my family is so <UNK> "" , meaning "" middle - class and normal "" ."
"we 'll write some blogs on specific <UNK> , but the starting point is to take these scores seriously ."
"firstly , they are <#> more area where other people will <UNK> you , and react in the wrong way ."
"the more they soft - <UNK> , the further into outer space you go . and secondly - a <UNK> means that under stress you are directly <UNK> yourself ."
"the more you behave in the opposite mode to your underlying need , the further you are pushing what you need away from yourself ."
it is a little harder when your usual score is opposite to your needs ( and the same side of <#> as your <UNK> ) .
i would make sure <#> or <#> people close to you at work and home understand your scores in this area and the importance of meeting the underlying need .
"yes there is a problem , got to fix it , not the end of the world or even your job . """
does your needs marker ( the circle ) sit close to the centre of the life - style <UNK> ?
"if it does then the needs page in your report will simply say something like "" you are most comfortable when other people avoid <UNK> "" ."
now that need can be a great <UNK> in keeping a diverse group together .
"you will tend to <UNK> in those who go to an extreme , which will be a blessing for those whose needs lie at the <UNK> opposite extreme ."
"on the other hand - you put a value on "" balance "" that is not self - evident to others ."
"you may well find that you surround yourself with other "" balanced "" people ... and like any tendency , that can have some negative results ."
"and of course you should be aware that you may be saying "" <UNK> "" when "" action "" is what is in fact required ."
there may be times when your love of balance is the last thing your <UNK> needs .
in fact we work with <#> <UNK> where the entire <#> - person senior management group are central needs .
it still makes it challenging sometimes when they know that something approaching a radical decision has to be made .
"this blog has a web feed , available at <UNK> <UNK> - take your people to the top"
we are setting up this blog as a fast way to get <UNK> method insights up on the web for our clients .
all the time we find that issues come up in the context of individual or group <UNK> which are widely <UNK> .
come back here often to see what we are up to .
i 've included the <UNK> url because there is now a growing body of research material up there - definitely worth a look when you have time .
got someone with blue needs ( the circle on the life - style <UNK> ) in your virtual team ?
blue needs people need - above all else - a sense of connection .
this is n't to say that blue needs and virtual teams ca n't work - but it takes extra work .
"green people tend to <UNK> ; they are thinking competitive advantage and <UNK> ( unique selling <UNK> ) , and expect their <UNK> to do the same ."
"after they have gone on for a few minutes we stop them and ask the yellow person , "" is this meeting your needs ?"
are they answering the questions you have n't yet had a chance to ask ?
"so we discuss what those questions are , and then ask the green to start again ."
"some of them become amazingly tongue - tied to start with , but are often <UNK> by how quickly they can adapt ."
green people live in the now ; yellow people on the other hand regard the past as an excellent <UNK> of future performance .
"they want to know what they can expect , based on the experience of others ."
"of course , the point here applies much more generally than just selling holidays ."
"whatever our profile , once we understand another person 's needs , we can adapt our usual style to meet those needs ."
"asking people to <UNK> their needs in order to <UNK> our usual behaviour is a non - <UNK> , albeit the way most of us operate by default ."
"if we used <UNK> only to understand the needs of those we communicate with , it would still deliver a huge return on our investment ..."
"of course , ideas and execution can be <#> different things ."
"here is an example that just came up in conversation , which i have heard in various forms on numerous occasions from blues ."
""" i 'd love to have my own business ."
"but worth checking which you love - the idea of having a business , or the reality of running <#> ."
"plenty of blues do run businesses , and very successfully , but there are things those who are strongly blue find particularly <UNK> ."
finishing <#> job before starting the next - that 's red .
"in other words , finding someone to get on the phones or knock the doors is n't going to be the whole solution even if it is possible ."
"they build <#> - to - <#> relationships , for a start ."
"the sense of connection matters at lot to blues , so they are often wonderful at building a network of individual friends ."
"and <UNK> , they are creative and future - oriented people who can often see beyond the horizon or think outside the box ."
"so why not work at creating the conditions where that will happen , and at least enjoy yourself as you do it !"
there is a component score that <UNK> this area as well .
"no , not authority or structure , which is what you may have been thinking , but rather freedom ."
"a low freedom usual score suggests that you will be at your most productive fitting in and belonging , which is a <UNK> for political success ."
"this may come as a surprise - many of the politicians who stick in our minds are the ones who stand out , surely ?"
think harder - the standing out usually goes with the political wilderness - think tony <UNK> for the past quarter century or <UNK> in the <UNK> .
"generally speaking , <UNK> in a "" political "" context goes with "" paying your <UNK> "" , "" pulling your weight "" and so on ."
so low freedom usual is another <UNK> that political success is possible .
"so - you have a high ca score , coupled with low freedom usual ?"

"although the relationship was short lived , i had a great date at la <UNK> ."
we went to pick up some wine before and sat in the parking lot drinking while we waited .
"although that does n't sound all that romantic , its a cute tradition at la <UNK> ."
friends of mine met there <#> years and i have n't been able to <UNK> them apart since then .
the mood is very <UNK> and the food is wonderful .
if you need a good first date place la <UNK> is a great suggestion .
"anonymous said ... wow , this is great ."
"when i turned <#> , i was pretty determined to find the man for me and get married ."
"<#> day out of nowhere , i recieved a call from a dating service telling me they wanted to survey my experience ."
i had previously responded to a personal ad i found in a publication i picked up at cafe <UNK> and thought they were referring to that .
so i agreed to go in and talk to them .
i was put into a room and given a hard sale by <#> of their <UNK> .
"i decided that since it was a goal of mine to be married , it might be worth the incredible sum of money to join ."
how substantial can a relationship be if it is founded only on physical attraction ?
does n't this process help you get to the chase ?
"well first of all , i quickly discovered that there were no <UNK> for the people making matches ."
"as a matter of fact , i do n't even think they read my profile ."
"it said , clear as day that i 'm an atheist ."
they set me up with several born again christian men .
"i guess they thought <UNK> , katy and <UNK> fit in that area ."
"by about number <#> , i was screening them myself over the phone before even <UNK> to meet them in person ."
they were sending me <#> and <#> <UNK> a week .
i was discovering that very few women were in this organization .
"while i was getting <#> - <#> <UNK> a week , these guys are getting <#> - <#> <UNK> a month ."
there was a lot of pressure on them to make something click since the opportunities were so few and far between .
i am so angry by the lack of care and respect they held for their <UNK> .
it is a money <UNK> from day <#> .
"if anyone wants to join a dating service such as together , do not focus on the number of members in their membership ."
but they gave me the impression that they did more than just throw people together .
"i 'll be filling some of the <UNK> duties for this blog , but angie is your fun and willing administrator ."
"even though i 'm not <UNK> nor really in the single crowd anymore , i ca n't wait to see what kind of wild stories get posted up here ."
"hello , this blog is for singles in the <#> plus age group ."
my friend <UNK> has a blog and it 's kinda fun to see what 's going on in her life .
i thought that this would be a good forum to tell the good and the bad of dating .
the following questions are examples of what i feel might be helpful to other <UNK> .
where 's a good place for a first date ?
do you have good ideas for meeting new and fun people ?
do you have any tips as to the best way to fill out the online profiles ?
"how do you transition from the <UNK> , to the real world ?"
there are probably others i have n't thought of .
"i 'd like to add links , but i am waiting to get feedback from others before adding them ."
"thanks for taking the time to read my blog , i look forward to hearing your thoughts !"
in a comment to my last post somebody asked why would i want to get dates from the internet instead of traditional ways of meeting people .
"he was n't asking in a <UNK> kind of way , he 's done it too , but it really is a good question ."
the first reason that i use the internet is that i am busy .
i am a struggling <UNK> just trying to get as much business as possible .
sometimes i am not home until late and do n't want to go out .
"with a traditional job you can go to happy hour , but that is not often in the cards for me ."
the next reason is something that may be difficult to understand .
i have friends all over this town and am invited to really cool events .
you 're probably thinking well what 's the problem ?
"finally , i just ca n't get into that meat market groove ."
"when i see somebody that i 'd like to meet , i am too shy to approach ."
"when somebody starts talking to me , i am often clueless to the fact that they would like to get to know me ."
"i am a very nice person , but sometimes appear to be <UNK> to new people ."
i think that an internet date gets alot of that out of the way .
"it 's like i 'd like to meet somebody , you 'd like to meet somebody , so we are here to see if we click ."
"i do n't know if anyone reads this , but i just thought i 'd share ."
i am going out for dinner and drinks with another fine gentleman i 've met on the internet .
"i think he 's a nice guy , but i 'm not sure we click ."
i 'm going out with him anyway because my friends tell me i do n't give people enough of a chance .
"so , i 'm not too sure about this guy ."
"i guess if the date turns out well , i can never show him my blog ."
i have had some very sweet comments on my last dating disaster .
i even think that the guy i 'm going out with tonight is nice .
"i just read monica 's response to bill clinton 's new book "" my life "" ."
she is upset about the way that clinton described their affair .
"she then told the british press that "" clinton 's book made her feel "" like an insignificant piece of dirt . """
"well when you are having an affair with a married man , you often feel like a piece of dirt ."
"maybe the new publicity will give her a forum , but a forum for what , whining ?"
read for yourself and see what you think .
"i know that people make mistakes , and that although an affair is a bad thing to do , it does not make you a horrible person ."
any account of this affair will not show ms .
"in her defense , an affair with a man that powerful might be difficult to resist ."
"i hope that this ugly <UNK> in our history <#> day goes away , but in the meantime , take responsibility ."
"say i did a bad thing and then "" suck it up """
"oh , i guess she already did ! ! !"
"this past weekend , i just did n't have the energy to go through another internet match up ."
"i had discussed meeting <#> gentleman , i just had to put it off ."
i just needed to hang out with my friends !
"i am not saying that i 'm discouraged , or do n't want to do this anymore , but just needed to back away ."
"this internet thing can be fun , but i think i might need to take a step back ."
my friend told me that i should do <#> of the more involved sites like e - harmony .
"i 'm also trying to get out more and meet people the old fashioned way , in person ."
i started chatting with a guy from <#> of the <UNK> sites and we decided to meet .
"we went to a bar , and hung out for a bit ."
as time went by the hints that the night should end shall we say at breakfast increased .
"not that this is not <UNK> , but i got the impression that if he were with any female , she would be getting the same "" offer ."
""" this guy told me how if he did n't like the profiles that he read , he would sent them rude messages ."
the reason he did n't like the profiles was that he felt that the women put in too many expectations .
"the rude messages would be like hey , you wanna get laid and stuff like that ."
"i knew at that time , his match made in heaven was n't me ."
"i told him that i realized that he was a "" sure thing "" but that i 'd have to pass ."
"made up some stuff about hope to see you again , and <UNK> ."
"i do n't know that there is a moral to this story , just that there are people out there that do n't have them ."
"it 's not that this guy made clear what he wanted , just that i did n't expect such a bottom <UNK> ."
i am looking forward to a new and better experience .
i found urllink this article on cnn that gives some <UNK> on how to watch out for bad online dating experiences .
"something i learned while reading this article is , men lie about being in a relationship , and women mostly lie about their looks ."
"some online dating sites want to offer a <UNK> , dated photo on your profile ."
good date we were heading from west houston to a friend 's house in <UNK> .
julie needed to pick up a computer from her friend .
we seemed to spend time in the truck quite a bit .
"i can not drive , so it is a good thing she enjoyed being the <#> behind the wheel ."
when we got to the friend 's house we decided to go for a day at the <UNK> restaurant .
we made it down to the front and waited inside the lobby for a while .
julie laid her head on my shoulder and fell asleep .

editorial : <UNK> editorial june <#> : <UNK>
"for those <UNK> addicted to the game at <UNK> , it is time to look for other <UNK> to release <UNK> - up frustrations and <UNK> ."
the statistics show too many young people spending time at <UNK> at the expense of more important things .
swift and strict measures must be taken to address these <UNK> .
"if , for the moment , this seems to be the best solution , so be it ."
<UNK> have to look elsewhere for equally cheap and fulfilling activities or be accompanied by adults .
"however , as in the past , whether or not <UNK> owners and <UNK> pay <UNK> to this ruling remains to be seen ."
it is crucial that they do — they and all those responsible for the well - being and future of all children .
"for there have been instances where the young <UNK> have been known to sleep at these <UNK> , so great is the addiction ."
"this letter appear on june <#> <#> in the star by "" a concerned father "" ."
<UNK> there are alot of <UNK> <UNK> with no moral obligation and social responsibilities .
congratulations to both of them for <UNK> this problem and expressing their concern .
"however , that is only the tip of the <UNK> ."
local authorities are <UNK> <UNK> without bothering about the social impact .
just look at the number of cyber <UNK> <UNK> up everywhere .
to expect the <UNK> to be ethical and to control those under <#> from <UNK> cyber <UNK> is like <UNK> a cat to take care of fish .
these <UNK> are only interested in making money .
"if the authorities are really concerned about this problem , they should limit the number of <UNK> issued and <UNK> the ruling strictly ."
cyber <UNK> should not be allowed in housing <UNK> and within certain <UNK> from schools .
regular surprise checks with the presence of reporters ( to prevent <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ) should be conducted .
<UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> should have their operations suspended on the spot for a period and their <UNK> <UNK> if they are caught committing the offence again .

", you can fool some people some of the times ."
"but whenever you do it , you are also losing your credibility ."
""" beware of online <UNK> i have a teenage son who is addicted to online games ."
it is out of desperation i write this open letter to all parents with the hope that they will not have to go through what i have gone through .
"about a year ago , a new online game company was set up in malaysia ."
"it dropped free cds into our <UNK> , outside schools , and <UNK> teenagers at shopping <UNK> ."
they told my son that it was a “ cute game ” and it was free .
"a few months later , my son ’s school performance started to <UNK> ."
he started sleeping or couldn’t concentrate in class and missed classes .
"a month before his <UNK> examination , i managed to <UNK> his pc and forced him to study ."
i was naive to think that he was over those computer games .
"<UNK> , i <UNK> him in a private college ."
"for a while , my son did well <UNK> in the college ; he even obtained a merit award for academic performance ."
outside his college are probably <#> to <#> cyber <UNK> promoting online games .
"he would play until the wee hours of the morning and skipped classes frequently , and developed a foul manner ."
"in the meantime , both my wife and i suffered in silence ."
our son lost interest in everything except the online games .
he has become more <UNK> because i think playing the games has given him a false sense of security in his fantasy world .
"finally , we made the painful decision to take our son out of college ."
we are now searching for a <UNK> centre to help him kick his habit .
"of course , not all online games are bad ; it is only fair to say that there are also some very good educational games in the market ."
i hope schools and colleges can conduct talks to advise students on the risks of game addiction .
"i also hope all parents will monitor their children more closely , and not make the mistake i made ."
"mr ling , i share the same <UNK> with you ."
would the authorities kindly flush out all these social <UNK> from the cyber <UNK> before it become too <UNK> ?
the recent reports about teenagers playing <UNK> and being addicted to online games have brought a bad image to cyber <UNK> .
it is sad that some of the <UNK> have turned their cyber <UNK> into video <UNK> . as they charge <#> <UNK> or <UNK> an hour
"in order to <UNK> this , the authorities should : <UNK> and <UNK> the charges at cyber <UNK> ."
this way <UNK> will spend less time there because they ca n't afford to play online games .
<UNK> <UNK> from entering cyber <UNK> during school hours .
<UNK> <UNK> from promoting and selling games through cyber <UNK> .
"i hope that the authorities will not close all cyber <UNK> , as they do benefit people like me ."
this article appeared on new <UNK> times on july 2nd <#> .
teenagers and <UNK> <UNK> have the iq but not the <UNK> anymore .
"the other day , my friends fired <#> young australian graduate less than <#> months after hiring him ."
"reasons : this young graduate is only interested in online games , not able to meet deadline , and always on msn in the office ."
another online <UNK> suck the <UNK> ! ! !
<UNK> <UNK> business a better option july <#> : <UNK>
addiction to online games is a serious form of social illness .
drink driving is dangerous and we <UNK> legislation to <UNK> <UNK> for those caught driving drunk .
"we <UNK> that not all movies are suitable for the public , so we established a <UNK> board to review their contents prior to their release to the public ."
"likewise , <UNK> by themselves do not cause social problems , but they are a contributing factor if they are not <UNK> ."
<UNK> <UNK> only <UNK> genuine <UNK> from providing legitimate information technology services to the local community .
"it is the responsibility of local authorities to introduce guidelines , review their <UNK> and <UNK> them to ensure <UNK> operate within the legal framework ."
"with regard to online games , not all are bad ."
but there are also online games with <UNK> ill intent .
the point is how many parents are capable of <UNK> the <UNK> of online games ?
i respect the courage of the education minister taking the initiative to conduct checks on <UNK> <UNK> .
she is now <UNK> on writting games reviews for a <UNK> .
"i read some of her game reviews , honest to heart , my comment is , she is good at <UNK> ."
the website <UNK> by her hardly had any visitors .
she is now <UNK> the <UNK> goodness of online games .
somehow she felt threatened by a concern parent calling for the government to control online games in malaysia .
she even go so low to attack a person in <UNK> .
this is the most <UNK> human being in the world .
"well , to this editor of a lesser known "" games magazine "" ."
the world you <UNK> in is just a fantasy .
"we have a discussions among us , have a real look of your photo and your <UNK> ."
"as much as you like to insult others , you must be be able to take insults in this real world ."
this letter appears on 5th july <#> in the star .
"it look like the star is only <UNK> to publish letter that is against community values . to the writer of this letter ,"
the rules and regulations for operating a cyber cafe are very clear !
it is just that the <UNK> are constantly trying to break the rules and regulations .
we do n't need cyber <UNK> if it is a source of social <UNK> .
ban cyber <UNK> if they’re a <UNK> the government encouraged us to use computers since we are now entering the age of <UNK> .
"if cyber <UNK> are such a <UNK> , just ban them !"
this editorial article appear on 5th july <#> in the new <UNK> times .
"<UNK> rules on <UNK> operations july <#> : <UNK> a report "" addicted to cyber - fantasy "" in the <UNK> on june <#> explained why <UNK> frequent <UNK> ."
"almost all the <UNK> complained they were bored , tense and wanted to relax by playing games ."
some said they played to release tension from all the <UNK> of teenage life .
others have pointed out that instead of drugs they preferred cyber games .
"<UNK> hang out in <UNK> as a break from school lessons , tuition , swimming and piano classes and homework ."
this is the reality today that more and more young people are getting addicted to cyber - fantasy .
"and this is a problem that the schools , parents and the authorities have to deal with ."
"there is nothing wrong playing computer games to relax , but this should be done in <UNK> ."
"any form of addiction is not good , particularly for <UNK> who have to sit for <UNK> ."
what will be most <UNK> is when addiction to computer games leads to gambling .
"while we are not against <UNK> , regulations <UNK> them , especially over their location and enforcement , must be <UNK> to avoid social <UNK> <UNK> from such places ."
"the following day , <#> secondary school <UNK> in uniform were rounded up at a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> during a surprise check ."
how is it that <UNK> of such <UNK> allow <UNK> into their <UNK> when the notices on the door clearly <UNK> that <UNK> in uniform should stay out ?
<UNK> are <UNK> all over the country and local authorities which issue <UNK> to these <UNK> are unable to monitor them .
"to expect <UNK> <UNK> to be ethical and self - <UNK> is impossible , taking into account their financial interests ."
the authorities must also take steps to ensure that any form of abuse should be <UNK> to prevent the <UNK> of social <UNK> among the young .
all local authorities should ensure that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the conditions of the <UNK> such as operating within reasonable hours and not allowing in the <UNK> .
these <UNK> should not be located close to schools and institutions of learning .
"with the <UNK> of the smart learning environment , <UNK> knowledge and information must be done with <UNK> moral education ."
more stress must be given to the <UNK> of moral values in education to prevent the <UNK> of more computer crimes .
on - line identity -- your “ <UNK> ” the on - line or virtual representation of you .
"this should be you , with a reasonable and limited amount of <UNK> ."
"however , many <UNK> and other on - line <UNK> choose an “ <UNK> ” ( image of a character , real or fantasy ) to represent themselves ."
many <UNK> have even gone as far as to create a <UNK> story or background for some <UNK> of their on - line life .
online game such as <UNK> is an example of online game <UNK> satan .
"an anonymous means by which to escape everyone has a few dreams or fantasies about what they would like to do with their lives , or a fictional character ’s"
it ’s just human to have even a little bit of imagination .
"in our thoughts , in our dreams , and in games we create and play , our imagination is a tool of creativity and desires ."
"however , imagination left <UNK> or <UNK> between fantasy and real life is sure to leave people stranded in <UNK> , <UNK> or not ."
"however , for those with compulsive or addictive on - line habits , small changes or differences in their on - line <UNK> may help them fight their addiction ."
"addicted <UNK> will often spend as much time as possible within the game , <UNK> real world responsibilities and requirements ."
we don’t want any of our visitors to <UNK> our intentions or come to a <UNK> conclusions that we’re an anti - gaming organization .
"most of us have left our on - line games behind , but that doesn’t mean we expect everyone else to do the same ."
"some of us still play other games , even ones that are considered to be “ on - line ” ."
"however , your identity within an on - line game or community will act as a <UNK> for your addiction ."
we hope the information we provided helps you realize the need to change your on - line identity to reflect the “ real ” you .
"this is <#> of the last steps your <UNK> completed , to remove his <UNK> <UNK> and replace it and his on - line identity with his real pic ."
"if you are in the middle of changing your on - line <UNK> or fantasy profile , consider a possibility other than some <UNK> character ."
"it is such a simple , yet profound <UNK> to use your own pic as your on - line identity ."
"if you can’t take a pic of yourself , as a friend to help ."
may be you’ll have problems getting that pic into a digital form ?
"many print shops , like <UNK> ’s , will help you scan your image into a computer and save it on a <UNK> disk ."
"start with just text about you as a real person , or a brief description of your life and your direction ."
"no need to give all of your personal life ’s details , just things you’re proud of , such as opinions , <UNK> , and ideals ."
why must your on - line identity be in the form of something else or someone else you admire or find interesting ?
who said you have to be so <UNK> and <UNK> in your on - line profile ?
"there are no rules here , only <UNK> because so many other addicted on - line <UNK> make <UNK> on - line <UNK> ."
on - line friends and <UNK> i remember a brief e - mail conversation i once had with an on - line <UNK> who will remain anonymous .
“ why do you still play the game even though you no longer enjoy it ?
"” i asked him , and he answered , “ all of my friends are there , my <UNK> and my <UNK> buds play all the time ” ."
the friendships and relationships you build within an on - line game may become quite powerful and can very well take the place of friends in your real life .
"in itself , and while you continue to play , there is nothing wrong with building these relationships as they become very supportive ."
"however , when you decide to leave your on - line game , your on - line friendships and relationships may have devastating effects ."
here you will learn about these effects and what is required to overcome them .
"on - line friends are not real friends as <UNK> as this may sound , this is far often true ."
may <UNK> will <UNK> insist that <#> 's online friends are as real and as good as real life friends .
"sometimes , if the friendships are strong enough , the <UNK> will even counseling people both in and out of game with real life issues ."
"although this is friendship , it is only given for as long as the <UNK> keep playing the on - line game ."
"these friendships typically end when <#> leaves the game , or shortly after ."
often the friendship <UNK> because the lack of constant communication and appearance within an on - line game .
typically strong on - line friendships will remain intact for approximately <#> - <#> months after a player leaves the game .
"e - mail , message board , chat room , and instant message communication continue for a while ."
soon both parties will realize that they are in <#> separate worlds now .
"most players leave a game with the intention of keeping in touch with a handful of their "" closest "" friends from the game ."
they believe the <UNK> built up between them and their friends would help their friendships last over a long period of time .
this is <#> very important reason why <UNK> - <UNK> is here and why we continue to support each other through our message board .
sometimes the person who left the on - line game will grow tired of hearing about the latest <UNK> of quest and eventually stop responding on their own .
what once was your best and closest on - line friends will no longer have any time for you .
"soon , a <UNK> who recently quit , will start to realize how empty and shallow the vast majority of on - line friendships and <UNK> are ."
"addicted <UNK> will soon <UNK> their real life friends , just as you’ve probably done to yours ."
"when you’ve quit , you’re now a real life friend to them , and they will <UNK> you ."
it ’s because <UNK> want to feel like they belong to something greater than themselves .
"there ’s nothing wrong with becoming part of a group of people , or wanting to belong ."
", you will be finding more excuses to keep playing ."
"well , seeking an existing group of friends is very similar to seeking people to act as an extended family <UNK> ."
"it is the desire of every socially inclined person alive , and it is natural to have this desire ."
we probably all do it at work or at school .
companies and organizations are founded by groups of business friends who are all interested in similar goals .
"this searching for a group of friends is very beneficial in the real world , however it will <UNK> to <UNK> your on - line game addiction ."
groups of friends try their best to stick together .
"losing a member of that “ family ” is not just a loss to <#> individual , it is a loss to the group ."
the last thing your guild wants is to have you quit the on - line game .
"don’t <UNK> , as you shouldn’t feel bad for leaving your guild ."
"they might defend the guild ’s purpose and the on - line game , and ask you to stay ."
"most will do whatever they can , within limited reason , to keep you both in the game and in the guild ."
tell your <UNK> that this move is important to you and essential to ending your addiction .
"you might not feel comfortable expressing your addiction awareness to them , and want to either <UNK> a story or avoid giving a reason ."
"whatever helps you leave your guild and the game is fine , but remember that you may want to contact these <UNK> later and tell them about your departure ."
explaining a lie may be a bit uncomfortable if you’ve dug yourself in too deep .
"they may be fairly quiet about your announcement , taking time to look within themselves -- they may be <UNK> ."
your friends might realize that <#> of their <UNK> is leaving because he or she has realized their real life has become <UNK> .
they may even ask you serious questions regarding the reasons behind your leave of the game .
"be <UNK> with these <UNK> , because they also might be considering the <UNK> of leaving the game or seeking help for their addiction ."
we’ve mentioned all of this under the assumption that your guild is a strong <#> with close and solid on - line friendships .
"however , some <UNK> are merely a <UNK> of people ."
<UNK> with no defined direction or goals may soon find themselves <UNK> .
"regardless of how close the members of your guild are , <UNK> are not always reliable or <UNK> ."
"unfortunately , there is n't the commitment of "" friendship "" between <UNK> when compared to groups of friends who see each other in real life ."
"it 's very easy to let down a group of friends in the game , or so to say , “ blow someone off ” ."
"these people would generally not do that real life friends , or the lines that they cross are typically much farther apart in real life ."
on - line games add a <UNK> amount of <UNK> that you otherwise wouldn’t find in real life .
being anonymous or semi - anonymous gives some people the feeling of <UNK> and they might choose to take advantage of this situation .
"“ in <#> of the <UNK> i was friends with , there was a very close relationship between a guy and a girl ."
"they were <UNK> for well over a year , chatted in game , <UNK> together often , and were for all practical purposes , "" married "" in game ."
this defining information was taken from sites <UNK> to drug abuse .
"the word drug has been placed in <UNK> to <UNK> a replacement point for other types of addiction ( <UNK> , internet etc . ) ."
there are as many potential definitions as there are groups with an interest in defining addiction .
"these definitions <UNK> such things as <UNK> <UNK> , psychological <UNK> , family <UNK> , <UNK> problems , and morality . '"
"does "" addiction "" mean only drug addiction ? ' no matter what "" drug "" is involved , the disease of addiction appears to follow a predictable course ."
"typically , the user begins out of some level of curiosity ."
"soon , their lives become more and more centered around getting the "" drug "" and finding opportunities to use it ."
"it begins to interfere with relationships , school , work , and other <UNK> productive areas of interest in their lives ."
"by now the "" <UNK> , the addiction , have taken control , and the individual is unable to function without the "" drug "" ."
"if there is not a physical addiction , there is most certainly a psychological <UNK> upon their "" drug "" of choice . and"
"why people are <UNK> ' no <#> wants to be an addict , but this does n't stop people from getting addicted ."
the most commonly asked question is simply - how ?
"how could my son , daughter , father , sister , or brother become a liar , a thief , someone who can not be trusted ?"
the first thing you must understand about addiction is that addictive <UNK> are basically <UNK> .
they <UNK> kill physical or emotional pain and alter the mind 's perception of reality .
"for addictive <UNK> to be attractive to a person there must first be some underlying <UNK> , sense of <UNK> , or physical pain . '"
"we start off with an individual who , like most people in our society , is basically good ."
this person encounters a problem or discomfort that they do not know how to resolve or can not confront .
"it can also include physical discomfort , such as an injury or chronic pain ."
the person experiencing the discomfort has a real problem .
"he feels his present situation is <UNK> , yet sees no good solution to the problem ."
everyone has experienced this in life to a greater or lesser degree .
the difference between an addict and the non - addict is that the addict chooses drugs or other <UNK> as a solution to the unwanted problem or discomfort . '
"the addiction <UNK> ' <UNK> to an <UNK> child in his first love affair , the use of drugs or alcohol becomes obsessive ."
whatever problem he was initially trying to solve by using drugs or alcohol fades from memory .
"at this point , all he can think about is getting and using drugs ."
"he will experience an overwhelming obsession with getting and using his "" drugs "" , and will do anything to avoid the pain of <UNK> from them ."
"this is when the newly - created addict begins to experience "" drug "" <UNK> ."
"ironically , the addict 's ability to get "" high "" from the "" drug "" gradually <UNK> as his body <UNK> to the presence of foreign influences ."
"he must take more and more , not just to get an effect but often just to function at all ."
"at this point , the addict is stuck in a vicious <UNK> spiral ."
"the "" drugs "" he <UNK> have changed him both physically and mentally ."
"<UNK> and problems ' a person tries "" drugs . """
"the "" drugs "" appear to solve his problem ."
"because he now seems better able to deal with life , the "" drugs "" become valuable to him ."
"the person looks on "" drugs "" l as a cure for unwanted feelings ."
"the <UNK> effects of "" drugs "" become a solution to their discomfort ."
"<UNK> the "" drug "" now becomes valuable because it helped them feel better ."
"this release is the main reason a person uses "" drugs "" a second or third time ."
"how addiction affects behavior ' the addict will now attempt to <UNK> the fact of his "" drug "" use from friends and family members ."
he will begin to suffer the effects of his own <UNK> and guilt .
he may become <UNK> and difficult to reason with .
"the more he uses "" drugs "" , the <UNK> he will feel , and the more depressed he will become ."
his relationships and job performance will go <UNK> downhill .
"there is such a thing as an "" addictive personality . """
it is artificial and is created by addictive <UNK> .
"this <UNK> a link between "" drugs "" and increasing difficulties with crime , production and the modern breakdown of social and industrial culture . '"
<UNK> excessive the <UNK> <UNK> online game ( “ <UNK> ” ) stands just behind the violent video game on the public <UNK> firing line .
"the argument goes that but for the respective <UNK> ’s addiction to the <UNK> , that particular <UNK> would pay more attention to his or her real life responsibilities ."
some critics also claim that <UNK> should bear warning labels <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> are addictive and not suitable for those with addictive personalities or related problems .
"<#> teen was shot in the leg and another teen suffered a head wound , police said ."
some reports said the <UNK> involved nearly <#> people .
"earlier this year , a youth was shot and killed outside the same cafe in <UNK> ."

"earlier this year , los angeles council members passed an <UNK> that required the presence of security guards at cyber <UNK> that stay open to the public at night ."
<UNK> does not directly blame cyber games for the violence but rather youth <UNK> that <UNK> in such places without proper <UNK> .

the <UNK> measures follow increasing pressure from parents and politicians in thailand to protect young children from the <UNK> of excessive online game playing .

what should you do when the baby is sleeping ?
i guess you 've figured out which way i went .
for those who do n't know me i 'm the mom of <#> kids age <#> months up to <#> years .
there are <#> girls and <#> boys but so far no sign of alice the maid or any other maid for that matter .
only i could manage to get a bee sting on my thigh .
i was picking up pool toys outside this afternoon .
and i did n't want them to blow away .
i picked up the beach ball and somehow managed to <UNK> a bee or <UNK> on my thigh .
it was a pretty stinky day all around .
"pick up materials for <UNK> projects , return a <UNK> i was sure would fit <UNK> but did n't , get some groceries and drop off some important papers ."
i had my <#> and the girl i babysit for .
they were picking at each other the whole time .
that is not a big deal but it does get on your nerves .
but oh the whining and complaining getting there . i wanted to go to the drive in tonight but
it looks like the weather is not on my side .
i 'll have to hunt up those baby gates .
i 'm afraid she 's going to be an early walker .
so i 'm sure in a month or so she 'll accidently let go and take off .
<#> of my others were early ( the other <#> were <#> - <#> months ) .
i think they have a little better sense of self - <UNK> when they are older .
"<#> month olds walk off the ends of steps , furniture , etc and do n't seem to get the fact they are going to fall ."
my oldest <UNK> is trying to finish <UNK> so we have <#> <UNK> of <UNK> to eat .
so i guess snacks are taken care of .
i better not blink or it will be my now <UNK> old doing <UNK> projects .
time really does go faster when you have kids .
"well , nothing like starting a blog and then not writing for days ."
this past weekend was our little town 's summer festival .
it <UNK> with the 4th of july every year .
so.. on thursday evening we went to the park to watch the kids ' baseball <UNK> in an <UNK> up game and stayed to watch the fireworks .
my <UNK> worked so i took the <UNK> <#> to watch the oldest <#> .
of course i then had to shell out money so they could walk around with their friends .
it 's always a good time and a great opportunity to catch up with people you <UNK> seen in awhile .
saturday the oldest <#> had to help with the <UNK> <UNK> and i took the youngest <#> to the <UNK> carnival .
we came home and had <UNK> and got in the pool .
i looked out and decided it was going to rain and having all <#> at a crowded <UNK> in the rain did n't sound like fun .
my oldest <UNK> still wanted to go so she got a ride with a friend .
she came home an hour and a half later totally soaked .
"sunday was a community church service , water ball fights and kid 's games in the fire hose ."
we of course let off our own <UNK> <UNK> etc at night . a good end to a holiday and festival .
today i took my ten year old ds to a friend 's house to stay until they are tired of him .
i took the opportunity to stop at walmart and buy all the stuff i never seem to get bought .
"tomorrow the girl i babysit will be back and things should be back to normal , or what passes for normal here anyway ."
ds <#> made breakfast for <UNK> and <UNK> this morning .
i want another <UNK> ! me too !
"mom 's so grumpy ! lol , and i thought they were just <UNK> to me ."
e got her haircut and then had me highlight it .
she seems happy with it ( which is good because if she started whining about it i would have had to <UNK> her bald . )
the <#> boys have complained i only ever e - mail or post pictures of the girls so i 'm <UNK> to be fair and include them .
this was taken outside church camp while we were waiting to pick up their sister .
the <#> oldest boys go to camp in <#> weeks .
the quiet will probably drive me crazy .... after <#> hours or so .
"ok , it 's only noon and i 've <UNK> destruction all morning in my effort to be productive ."
that was great except i hit the top of the <UNK> tap and <UNK> it off .
i 'll try to convince him that the <UNK> bucket adds charm to the side yard .
"i came in and <UNK> the bathroom carpet , hung out the towels , threw in more laundry and then tried to fold up the <UNK> play yard thing ."
"so , i went to run errands ... and <UNK> up the wheel cover thing ."
"i would just go back to bed and start over but i need to shower and take ds s and ds c to the dentist ,"
that will eat up the whole evening until 9:00 .
well tomorrow is another day ( that was my best <UNK> <UNK> by the way :-) )
i have been sick since sunday evening with a kidney infection .
<UNK> ! ! while i laid around the kids played and played and played which was good .
"of course laundry , cleaning , etc fell far behind ."
now that i am up i 'll need to bring the house out of its spin into <UNK> .
i did n't feel up to going to <UNK> ds 's baseball game last night .
of course it was the game where he got hit in the eye with a ball .
every game i do go to nothing happens .
it must not be our family 's week either because <UNK> <UNK> got hit by a pitch at softball .
"but hey , she did get a base ."
"all the playing and swimming did have <#> good effect on <UNK> <UNK> , she fell asleep outside playing ."
"hmmm , how does the weekend disappear so quickly ?"
"saturday was <UNK> , <UNK> and more <UNK> ."
the oldest <#> spent almost all day working .
i finally got groceries . as a reward we went to the drive - in to see shrek ii and harry potter .
it was lots of fun except for the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> throwing up .
she did manage to do it in a shopping bag and not on the van seat so that was at least a plus .
we only have to teach every third month and i have the <#> - <#> yo
got everyone 's sheets and all the towels washed while i could hang them to dry .
of course they were all done for about <#> minutes until everyone got back in the pool .
it seems like i should have more to show for a weekend .
i also realize i have no amusing way to say that .
"sorry , for hip cutting edge blogging you 'll have to look elsewhere ."
"<UNK> and i went out for a coffee , he took l and f to the park ."
"then he took e , s and c to "" i , robot "" ."
i sat in the yard enjoying the weather .
"yesterday i needed <UNK> to breathe , today was like may ."
i let a explore the <UNK> for the first time .
i do n't even think she ate much sand .
so now i 'm sitting here nursing a vodka <UNK> and feeling the sleeping weight of a on my shoulder .
"ok , we never actually left indiana but you get the idea ."
after <#> days at an amusement <UNK> park we are home .
he lost the <#> year old twice ( grr ) .
he also took the oldest <#> back to the park for late night fun while i stayed in the room with cranky little kids .
i very carefully made sure all the children and <UNK> applied <UNK> and ( duh ! ) forgot to put some on me
i also took my camera and then forgot to take <#> single picture .
hey at least i ca n't bore you with pics of my vacation .
;-) the kids really had fun though .
"even c , my <UNK> , who is never <UNK> pleased announced he was happy ."
we managed to arrive home in the middle or a huge <UNK> .
"we lost power at 11:00 ( darn , ca n't finish the laundry tonight ) and it came back on at <UNK> this morning ."
i know this because everything that had been on suddenly kicked back to life .
we had to be up at 6:00 anyway to deliver e and s 's <UNK> projects for judging .
we did n't stay for judging though because i had to take s to the doctor .
he managed to get <UNK> 's ear and a secondary infection on top of it .
now i need to rest up for the next <UNK> whenever that may be .
we got home from church and after a sandwich all the kids went out to play .
i sat on the swing and watched them swim and swing and play football and blow bubbles .
i came back in to start packing for our trip .
so i 'm saying 7:00 so we get out on time .
"the rest of my afternoon was spent packing clothes , food , <UNK> , etc ."
i remember being <#> and leaving for the weekend with just a clean pair of underwear in my purse .
the oldest <#> did pack for themselves but i knew i 'd have to check it .
when i came back down stairs i found mel at the back door .
her expression was clear that if she could just get that door open she 'd be outside too .
i 'm leaving you with a pic of my <UNK> .
it 's sort of like a test pattern .
"it 's a little <UNK> to remember test patterns , lol !"
this is what is left of our back porch and patio .
it has taken <#> and a half very large <UNK> and lots of noise to get to this point .
while i 'm really looking forward to the finished product i 'm sure the next couple months are going to drive me crazy .
they did fill in the old <UNK> in the back which puts my mind at rest about that at least .
i was always afraid <#> of the kids would find a way to fall in it .
next week they will be tearing off our current <UNK> room .
it is really an old porch someone put <UNK> around .
not pretty but i will be without a <UNK> and dryer .
"i can hardly wait to make trips to the <UNK> , <UNK> !"
i have been trying for the last couple of weeks to get up early and walk before the baby and the little kids get up .
i 'm waiting for that energy boost that comes from being in shape .
last spring it flooded so things are <UNK> and muddy .
i have also been trying to decide whether to save some baby stuff .
but i have never gotten rid of baby stuff .
i 'm not sure i 'm <UNK> able to do it .
"afterall , <UNK> might feel less old <#> of these evenings and my soon to be <#> year old body might <UNK> ."
i need to go through boxes of things from the garage .
"i have found <UNK> and sporting <UNK> , my old school letters , photo albums ."
"maybe i 'll spread it out , take a <UNK> pic of it and get rid of the real thing ."
what is a middle aged woman doing hanging on to basketball and <UNK> <UNK> for ? ?
and i thought i reduced when we moved <#> years ago .
"well , back to the black hole of a garage ."
if i never post again you 'll know where to look for me . ....
what i have done today . <#> .
"<UNK> at <UNK> to make cinnamon rolls , get up all children , feed , water and dress said children . <#> ."
pack <UNK> in van and drive <#> <#> hours to camp .
spend <#> hour standing in line checking in <UNK> .
drive back home with <UNK> to.. <#> .
<#> . try to give children lunch ( even though it 's 1:30 and they have been <UNK> for hours ) .
<#> . move van with <UNK> frames still inside so that <UNK> can bust up our concrete back porch and steps to begin our construction .
<#> . give up on anyone including baby taking a nap while large <UNK> is going outside kitchen .
<#> . make dinner after <UNK> stops at 5:30 .
"feed very tired children dinner , bathe nurse and <UNK> ( which includes watching thomas again ! ! ! and veggie tales ) until the little <UNK> fall asleep ."
"do dishes , do laundry , explain to <UNK> why she can not spend the night in the <UNK> barn at the fair ."
drum roll please .... drop into computer chair .
how could the day be so full and so little be accomplished ? ? ?
i need to take s and c to camp tomorrow .
e is staying the night with a friend tonight .
it would seem ( if i were the paranoid type ) that my children ca n't wait to get out of here .
we went to the <UNK> fair today to check on the kids ' projects .
"they did really well , lots of blue <UNK> and even a couple special merit <UNK> ."
i have been trying to be more productive around here .
i hate things getting away from me around the house but i also hate not getting to play on my ' <UNK> .
i am now more caught up on strangers lives than i am my family .
"that is probably very sick , or <UNK> , or both !"
now that i have <UNK> all my single <UNK> friends who are wondering how i became so sappy and <UNK> i will go to bed :-p
f has that <UNK> pose down and l looks like such a <UNK> ( which she is not )
thank god the destruction part is mostly over .
"we have lost our cable tv , which means all tv ."
so far the weather has been good and no <#> has complained but if it turns rainy i 'm sure to hear some complaints .
actually we had no power most of yesterday and some of wednesday .
we 'll soon be as <UNK> as our <UNK> .
ds <#> is going to a <UNK> party tonight .
it is the first <#> he has gone to .
he is not a very social animal so hopefully he will do fine .
i 'm not sure i remember the last time she was home or did n't have someone stay here on friday .
it 's the first time she 's ever been grounded .
i 'm not sure <UNK> myself to her teenage attitude was all that smart on my part though :-) .
"<UNK> yo <UNK> , seems fine now so i guess i can put off that call to the priest ."
"mel has learned to stand up all by herself in the middle of the room , no pulling up on furniture ."
i know walking wo n't be far behind now .
i really am trying to <UNK> and enjoy every baby minute but
"well , i need to go see if i can <UNK> something for dinner ."
"i 'm just stating for the record here , i 'm drowning in <UNK> and i 'm pretty happy about it ! !"
"you know the saying "" <UNK> the <UNK> falls down so hard you need a hat . "" ?"
"they tore off my former <UNK> room today , sending clouds of really gross dust and dirt everywhere ."
it was very hot and humid and i could n't put on a fan because it just pushed the dirt and dust around more .
there was no point in trying to clean it up until they were done .
it has a shallow sandy spot put in for little kids and the <UNK> can go dive off a <UNK> .
all was well until <UNK> <UNK> l decided to have the mother of all fits .
"i mean a screaming , crying , running away , throwing yourself down , slapping , head spinning fit ! !"
"( ok , maybe her head did n't spin but it was close . )"
i 've seen many fits but this just might take the cake .
and the <UNK> is nobody seems to know what the problem was .
so i 'm sure we made a lovely picture ...
hopefully tomorrow i 'll feel i 'm raising loving children and not the girl from the <UNK> .
"you know the phrase "" the <UNK> i go the <UNK> i get . "" ?"
that pretty much sums up the last few days .
i returned from the 10th circle of hell aka my garage <UNK> .
i beleive i have finally finished in there .
i picked up my <UNK> <#> and <#> from camp saturday .
that ate about <#> hours out of the morning .
i was then faced with the dilemma of burning or actually washing all the laundry they brought back .
about load <#> later i realized i had made the wrong decision .
i also went to a friend 's house to check out her garage sale <UNK> .
e got several pair of jeans in the very hard to find size <#> and a cute fall jacket .
"she kept saying "" <UNK> it makes a <#> pound <UNK> . """
"hmm , that might do us <#> meal ."
it 's much easier to bake up <#> <UNK> at a time in the oven .
"hmmm , where was i ... today was church and"
then i left my messy house and had some fun gosh darn it with the kids .
i took all <#> and e 's friend l swimming at the community pool .
i kept mel in her little <UNK> boat ( her <UNK> <UNK> ) and she had a great time .
the <UNK> <#> stayed with me in the middle size pool and the older <#> took off for the water slides and diving boards .
i called it <UNK> about 4:30 though because we had to get back for a carry <UNK> show at church .
"we ate there , helped clean up and watched e and l try to soak up as much <UNK> as they could ."
"oh , and i came off like a big poop because i would n't let the sweet old ladies holding mel stuff her full of ice cream ."
"they probably think i 'm full of <UNK> ideas , lol ."
i find when i know i have to stop what i 'm doing in <#> hours to leave i do n't start big projects .
of course they have it at different times so that means <#> trips out of the house .
"oh well , it will get me back in form for the school ( <UNK> ! ) year ."
i 'm not sure what the deal is with the weather .
i 'm ready to build a fire and make <UNK> for heaven sake when i should be having a midnight swim and iced tea !
"why oh why did people "" update "" in the ' <#> 's ."
it is really cool but not in such great shape after being stuck under <UNK> <UNK> for <#> years .
maybe i can take the <UNK> piece and <UNK> it off to make some sort of wall art .
i got the kid 's back packs ready with all the school supplies they needed .
i can not believe they go back to school on wednesday .
i suppose it will get nicely hot when they return .
i so do n't want them to go back .
it 's nice to have them all around and not have to live on the school 's schedule .
"i strongly considered calling the school and telling them not to look for my kids before labor day , lol !"
"seriously , oldest <UNK> e will be in the 7th grade ."
i 've been fighting a bad case of baby fever today .
mel is just so darn cute i ca n't imagine not having another .
", we 'll see , men can be weak ;-)"
just some things i 've found amusing the last few days .
in the midst of the mess any humor found is good .
"<#> yo ds insists on telling everyone about his new "" shoot gun "" ( water <UNK> ) ."
<UNK> <#> has a b - day on the 24th .
"she is asking for "" an old crown with real <UNK> ."
"geez , maybe too many dollar store gifts ?"
"ds <#> has <UNK> this "" <UNK> tv "" ."
"i hear them talking in the other room "" hey , when this game of <UNK> is done , wanna go watch <UNK> tv ? """
"<UNK> "" - mail to : william h. <UNK> <UNK> dept ."
"so , do you qualify for the $ <#> credit under a prescription drug card plan ?"
"in <#> , for singles , your income can be no more than $ <#> ."
"in <#> , for married couples , income can be no more than $ <#> ."
"according to a recent research poll conducted by the <UNK> family foundation , there is generally mass confusion concerning these new prescription benefits in the <UNK> program ."
“ score ” of the poll wound up being <#> ( <#> meaning very <UNK> viewed and <#> being most positively viewed ) .
"in other words , the overall reaction , once the facts are revealed , is still <UNK> negative ."
"go to : urllink <UNK> here is a chart , published april , <#> by the minority staff committee on government reform – u.s ."
"the entire report can be found , in <UNK> <UNK> format , by urllink clicking here !"
the committee found that those <#> cards were fairly typical and closely represented all of the prescription drug cards being offered through the program .
the average drug card price was <#> % higher than canadian <UNK> .
"<UNK> card had the lowest prices overall of the <#> , but were were still <#> % higher than canadian prices . here"
"<UNK> , the <UNK> medication , cost $ <#> with the <UNK> card –"
the canadian price for <UNK> was only $ <#> .
there are many meds available from canada for less than half of the best price through the “ cards .
"for example , in columbia , missouri , i did a comparison of birth control pills ( <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> , <#> <UNK> per month ) ."
even the lowest generic price for birth control pills ( <UNK> ) was over $ <#> .
the canadian prices are more than a <#> % savings on the brand name and over <#> % savings even compared to the generic version .
this indicates that purchasing from canada may very well make sense for anyone on any regular monthly prescription .
it is an option that everyone should at least check out .
this information was <UNK> directly from the official <UNK> website : <UNK> first <UNK> – the <UNK> you will pay a $ <#> annual <UNK> –
so you pay for the first $ <#> worth of <UNK> that you buy .
"add to that the $ <#> ( or more ) premium you pay , and you are already out $ <#> before <UNK> part d pays a <UNK> ."
"– you would have paid the $ <#> premium ( or more ) , the $ <#> <UNK> and $ <#> <UNK> ( <#> % of $ <#> ) ."
"again , from the <UNK> above , don’t forget that you also paid that $ <#> premium ."
that amounts to <UNK> part d paying for just a little over <#> % of your drug costs .
"so , if your drug costs are around $ <#> per month , then part d of <UNK> will help you a little ( <#> % ) ."
"but , if your prescription drug costs are over $ <#> per year , <UNK> part d will be picking up <#> % of the costs ."
"for a huge example , let ’s say that your prescription drug costs are $ <#> per month ."
you would pay <#> % of the $ <#> which is $ <#> .
"so , will the <#> part d of <UNK> help you if you <UNK> in ? that ’s a good question ."
"if you are paying over $ <#> per month for your <UNK> , it may be a good deal for you ."
what level of <UNK> would i have to reach for the <UNK> part d to have actually paid at least half of my drug bills ?
this whole <UNK> prescription card and insurance deal reminds me of <#> .
"seniors , including backing by the <UNK> begged for <UNK> coverage under <UNK> ."
"congress passed the <UNK> <UNK> act of <#> , then when the seniors found out what they were getting begged to have it <UNK> , and it was ."

that 's why i got myself a new script with all the sophisticated bells and <UNK> an internet <UNK> needs .
it has a lot of great features like sales tracking and split testing .
testing is that important and my old script ( <UNK> ) did not allow me to do this .
"moreover , i can now even track my sales from any ads ."
"of course , only for websites i have full control over ."
so tracking of sales for any <UNK> programs will not work .
"at least , as far as i know about that ."
the best part about this script is that it is very easy to install .
"with a lot of <UNK> programs , i am getting in trouble during the installation process at <#> point or the other but not with this <#> ."
you are guided through a step by step setup process which includes even some <UNK> from the <UNK> software so you can see how it needs to be done .
this has been the easiest <UNK> installation i have done so far ( i have done around <#> or <#> ) .
"when you get <UNK> to your <UNK> , you can even see <UNK> <UNK> of the statistics and it will <UNK> your <UNK> ."
sales tracking is done by means of adding an image tag to your <UNK> and your <UNK> page .
"i have n't seen this in action , though , as it is just about <#> minutes ago that i did the installation ."
but i am pretty sure it will work great as this tracking software is recommended by a lot of internet <UNK> including john <UNK> .
urllink click here if you want to see this tracking script in action ( goes to the <UNK> page )
"john <UNK> is going to release his traffic secrets course on tuesday , aug ."
the whole internet marketing world is excited about that and it is already creating a buzz ...
because he 's a guy who is doing business online for more than <#> years already and has tested almost everything online .
he knows what works to sell huge amounts of products - he has personally sold products worth millions of dollars .
"not only does he reveal for the first time how he does it , he shows you how to achieve these results ."
i am <#> of the first people who has already received his traffic secrets package and i must tell you : this rocks !
it has <#> dvds which show john at his recent sold out internet marketing seminar ( $ <UNK> ! ! )
"gary said , it was the best seminar he has ever visited ."
"personally , i was impressed by the search engine dvd even though "" i thought , i knew it all "" ."
"but even though john did not reveal the secrets himself but some of his seminar <UNK> , i can tell you that it reveals <UNK> stuff ."
e.g. they tell you how to get your site listed within <#> hours of putting it up .
but the best thing is that he gives you step by step directions for getting lots of traffic to your site every time you roll out a new product .
you can see everything in the dvds but he also has included some nice coloured <UNK> where you can see exactly what to do and in which order .
i also liked the dvd about tracking a lot and it gave me directions how i can improve my own tracking .
he has another <#> cd - <UNK> where he takes you by the hand in a series of <UNK> videos .
these videos are divided into different chapters and everything is made very easy to follow .
the videos are played automatically <#> after the other .
"of course , you know pay - per - click search engines ."
then you just need to put the <UNK> sections into action .
"and in a third <UNK> , you can track your progress and enter the exact traffic numbers ."
"these secrets are not for "" <UNK> "" , though ."
only if you are serious and dedicated to your online business will john let you have his collection of proven and tested website traffic secrets .
"only if you order within the first <#> hours , you will be able to get it -"
"today , i received a <UNK> request for my <UNK> software ( it <UNK> <UNK> programs to the <UNK> program <UNK> ) ."
"nothing special about it , you would say , but the problem with it was that my customer mentioned reasons why he wanted the <UNK> ."
"he said , the software would not submit fast enough to the <UNK> ."
the other reason he mentioned was that it had some <UNK> <UNK> included which were not working .
"but exactly for this reason , the software has built - in functions to remove those non - working <UNK> . and"
i have taken hours upon hours to find new <UNK> today and i have created an updated file for the <UNK> which just needs to be downloaded .
i told him that i have the impression that he 's ripping me off .
"of course , no <#> likes to hear something like that ."
but what would you have thought or done in such a situation .... ?
"click on the "" <#> comments "" below if you want to answer this question ."
<#> of the first comments about new products i want to make is about mike <UNK> 's <#> internet marketing <UNK> .
it took me quite long to get through all of these pages but it was really worth it .
"i have found so many new ideas that am now more convinced than ever that internet marketing still is the correct "" <UNK> "" for me ."
"in his book , mike spots the latest <UNK> and <UNK> how they will develop in the next few years ."
<#> example : he 's mentioning search engines which will be able to <UNK> the users input .
"so if a <UNK> does a search for "" tiger "" , the search engine will know that the <UNK> professional tiger woods is meant and not the animal ."
his book is mainly responsible that i started blogging and that i am adding rss feeds to my websites .
the next step after publishing my first marketing thoughts <UNK> on blogger.com will be to show them on my new site : <UNK> .
"it 's a site i have registered especially for testing these "" new "" technologies like blogging and using rss feeds ."
the first day it was nice to be able to <UNK> my news a little at a time .
i knew my control over this was pretty limited . especially since i work at a church .
"the evening the <UNK> was confirmed , i went to visit my friend <UNK> ."
we 've known each other for <#> years and i wanted to tell her in person .
"i knew the <UNK> could sense that i was ok and , of course , we could hug . )"
"it was so helpful to me to <#> ) have some liquor handy , <#> ) sit and talk ."
she took me out for sushi and drinks that evening and we laughed and had a good time .
"the hardest person to tell will be my mother , who was diagnosed with <UNK> cancer <#> years ago and now doing well ."
i 'm not ready to hear anyone cry . still not scared i 'm a little worried that i 'm not feeling this yet .
i believe the pictures the gi doc gave me .
before a month ago i was visiting my mother for a few days .
"we had a lovely visit , ate lots of good food and i was preparing to fly home ."
"the morning of my flight i got sick -- super <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"my uncle comes to take me to the airport and says , "" so you drank too much last night , huh ? """
another wave of <UNK> ( do n't ever say that to someone who is about to get into your car . )
he drops me at the airport where i stand in the counter line and throw up just as the agent asks my destination .
"suddenly people surround me -- offering a chair , helping clean me up , <UNK> me to the restroom where i can rest ."
the episode is over and i head home feeling fine .
i have a little pain in my upper <UNK> .
a few days later i see the doctor because i suspect my <UNK> is the problem .
"she orders test which all show me and my <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> and liver are healthy <UNK> ."
doc says i could sell my <UNK> levels they 're so good .
"i 'm thinking , well i guess i should avoid eating like i just ate at mom 's ."
so i 'm <UNK> and ready for my big procedure .
prep is n't as bad as people told me .
"i take the bus up to the hospital , glad to have a day off from work ."
"the clinic is running late and i 'm starving , but i 'm getting a lot of reading done while waiting for them to scope me ."
the nurses and other <UNK> are helpful and pleasant .
the doctor is the guy who smiled at me in the elevator on the way up to the clinic .
the doc tells me about the risks of <UNK> and <UNK> me he tries to avoid that .
"<UNK> , <UNK> , thankfully gives me the stuff to put me under ."
then a pat on my butt which has been the main object of everyone 's attention .
"<UNK> <UNK> is holding my hand as i gaze through the haze . "" a <UNK> much like you described your mother 's "" the doc says ."
<UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> my hand and i suspect now that i was spilling my <UNK> to her .
what a gentle way to hear really bad news .
the next thing i know i 'm in the recovery room and my husband is <UNK> my hair .
the doc has told my husband that he 'll rush the <UNK> results and call in a couple of days .
they hand me beautiful photos of my <UNK> along with the <UNK> -- <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> .
thank god for <UNK> or whatever it was they gave me in there .
"in fact , i 'm still not feeling anything . <#> july <#>"
<UNK> ok i have wondered how it would feel to hear a <UNK> of cancer <UNK> at you .
i did n't think it would feel like this .
in fact <#> days later i 'm still not feeling anything bad .
"in fact , i 'm feeling a little high ."
like when my dad died suddenly and god seemed so much <UNK> and all my senses were <UNK> . everywhere i turn i saw good .
"i was above all grateful , not scared ."
we 'd set up this lunch date weeks ago .
after lunch we went to the little chapel at church and prayed .
<#> hours after that i had my <UNK> appointment with my spiritual director .
"i felt as if god had arranged my schedule for me , handing me from <#> loving person to the next"
so i would n't have to touch the ground just yet .
"to my delight , my spiritual director , aka <UNK> , has an <UNK> of beautiful cats who also <UNK> to me that afternoon ."
with <UNK> i started to list all the great things that had just happened to me .
<#> ) i 'm surrounded by people who love me
( god help those who have to go through this alone . )
<UNK> may not have to go to staff meetings for a long time
"<#> ) i think i 'm guaranteed to lose <#> lbs through this , maybe more ."
<#> ) i was planning to leave for <UNK> within <#> months but have n't yet .
<#> ) i still have a job and insurance .
<#> ) i do n't have little kids around the house <UNK> .
the list will continue to grow i 'm sure .
"hopefully , through this experience god will make of me a stronger more compassionate person and a kick - ass pastor !"
"except for "" i love you "" --- i do n't need to hear much of what others have to say to me ."
helpful --- everyone i have told has said --- let me do whatever i can to help you .
but specific offers of help have been <UNK> . especially of those things i may not have thought of myself .
jane is going with me to the <UNK> scan --- when they will stage the cancer .
<UNK> offered to call people who need to know things .
"others have offered to listen to me , whenever i need to talk ."
attorney friends have brought up questions of medical <UNK> -- i would n't have even thought of that .
"not helpful --- someone told me i was "" truly a servant of god ."
"another said "" not you - you 've got your whole life ahead of you . "" that was almost <UNK> ."
this is why i put off telling people for a few days .
i also do n't need to be <UNK> to .
if you listen to what i 'm saying i know god loves me and i know i 'm in god 's hands .
to whom it may concern -- do n't assume you know how i feel .
"i 've felt incredibly close to god , and still , after <#> days , not scared of what lies ahead ."
but you wo n't know unless i tell you .
"i 've lived the majority of my life in "" the valley . "" yes , the very same <#> made famous in song ."
"and yes , sadly , we really did talk that way ."
"<UNK> after the song came out , but that was just a matter of being proud of ourselves , our surroundings , our <UNK> ."
"so , while not a first generation "" valley - <UNK> , "" i 'm proud to say i was <#> of the original valley girls ."
do n't let anyone from the valley fool you ; we 're all still the same deep down inside .
"fun loving , pool <UNK> , <UNK> ( even if they did kill our beloved <UNK> and replace it with something totally <UNK> ."
"<UNK> williams was a good addition , though . )"
"i , myself , am a mother of <#> ."
"i may be nearly <#> , but i 'm a valley girl , for sure , and we ca n't get old ."
"so , if you are not among the fortunate and an <UNK> ."
"val yourself , forgive me if i <UNK> <UNK> into my <UNK> ."
the last <#> years have been unreal for me .
"i 've had my share of <UNK> and <UNK> , and i 'm still <UNK> in the <UNK> of both ."
"the <UNK> were so , so , high , the <UNK> <UNK> the depths of hell at times ."
"i 've got all this crap stored in me , that i simply must <UNK> and you are my lucky audience ."
"i 've decided to get it all off my chest , in the most <UNK> honest fashion ."
"i 'm tired of trying to keep much of this stuff to myself , lest i be embarrassed in front of other people ."
"what the fuck is that all about , anyway ?"
"i do n't care about most of them , and life is what it is ."
"mistakes , <UNK> , things that work out ."
"most of them are better used as comedy than <UNK> for the <UNK> mill , since we all suffer <UNK> repeatedly throughout this life ."
"so , after my kids , i find myself about <#> lbs ."
"i 've been reading the south beach diet , and it sounds like a good philosophy ."
"i 'm not <#> anymore , and i ca n't eat whatever i want ."
"most people ca n't , so it 's not like i 'm less of a human being for it ."
( even though many would and have tried to make me feel that way . )
i 'm not the ' fat fucking cunt ' my mother in law says i am .
"the fucking cunt part , well that came naturally , my <UNK> really ."
the fat part and the fucking cunt part have nothing to do with <#> another -- let 's just get that straight .
i wo n't be fat forever ; in fact not much longer .
"as for being a fucking cunt , well that 's probably here to stay . back to the south beach ."
"as of yesterday , i 've lost <#> lbs ."
"so , i guess i 'm <#> lbs over my normal weight now ."
"i realize that my love affair with sugar , particularly chocolate anything , has at long last come to an end ."
i 'll have to indulge my unhealthy tendencies in some other fashion .
"no wait , i already did that <#> ."
i 'm still smoking -- and in los angeles that 's the 8th deadly sin .
"but i 'm not catholic , so i do n't give a rat 's ass ."
"i 'll give that up eventually , but not because some asshole <UNK> me into it ."
now there 's an unhealthy practice that would actually aid the weight loss ...
for the first time in <#> years my weight went down !
<#> pounds and i feel great about it if not a bit skeptical - was it a <UNK> ?
"anyway , i 'm back on track after a little heavy partying and ready to see if it will happen again !"
"daniel , i can not tell you with words all that i am feeling in my heart ; words do not do my love justice ."
i can not tell you how i want you deep down in my soul ; words can only touch the surface .
"and i can not tell you with my mouth how i yearn for you in my whole body , for words fail to come close to <UNK> my need ."
"but for now , while that is all we have , please take these <#> words and know that they mean so much more ..."
"he thought he was in control , but he really is n't ."
he loves me so much that it 's driving him crazy .
now he ca n't get me out of his mind .
"and when he closes his eyes , he sees me ."
"the air moves around him , and he feels me touch him ."
"he reaches out in the dark to take hold of me , but <UNK> a fist - full of empty air ."
"i 've gotten into his blood , under his skin ."
he thinks of me all through the day and sees me in his dreams at night .
"he thought he could keep control of how he was feeling about me , but he lost it ."
"and now it 's driving him crazy , because he did n't think that love would take him over quite like this ."
"you want me as daylight <UNK> across the room , a hunger burns you deep ."
it <UNK> the blood within your veins and keeps you from your sleep .
a <UNK> <UNK> down your neck and <UNK> out a sigh .
"in whispered <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , you part your <UNK> thighs ."
you yearn to feel your <UNK> <UNK> my wanting skin and ache to feel your <UNK> firm against my flesh within .
this poem by bliss <UNK> has always been <#> of my <UNK> .
it has inspired me to write outside myself and has encouraged me when i did n't understand my own melancholy silence .
"outside , a yellow <UNK> tree , shifting upon the <UNK> blue with tiny <UNK> sound , <UNK> to let the sunlight through ."
then as the purple twilight came and touched the <UNK> along our <UNK> another shadow stood without and <UNK> the dancing of the leaves .
"restless and vague as a gray wind her heart had grown , she knew not why ."
writers write primarily because they have something to say .
words just happen to be the medium used to translate their thoughts and feelings to others .
my <UNK> muse <UNK> me with its lie and i believe it ever time .
i thought the fear that was keeping me from writing was either the fear of failure or success .
"this fear is the <#> that makes me run away from my feelings , that keeps me from staring them square in the eyes and <UNK> them ."
"without this honest connection to myself , my writing has become superficial and dull ."
"in order to write poems that are emotionally moving , i have in the past had to feel the emotions myself while i 'm writing them ."
"without this ability to jump into my poems , they become mere words on a page ."
so now i write in the hopes that my own words will spark my muse and once again jump start my heart .
i have recently been trying different writing exercises to <UNK> my muse .
i 've been <UNK> more in free verse lately and my <UNK> seem to be about the death of the <UNK> within me .
"and as falling leaves float through a cold air , tears scar my face , turning it <UNK> and pale ."
"words are <UNK> the music stops the dance is over deep shadows fall over the place where <UNK> steps once played in the <UNK> , orange glow of evening ."
ever since i got a <UNK> on a short story i wrote for english class back in <#> i have had an <UNK> desire to get published .
"over the past <#> years i have had an essay , a short story ( the coin ) and a poem published ."
i will keep a diary telling you the reader all the mistakes ...
i mean all the great decisions i made <UNK> in the sale of the book .
<UNK> pulled a gold watch out of his <UNK> pocket as he <UNK> down main street .
as he had done countless times before he admired the <UNK> image of an <UNK> <UNK> train on its lid before it popped open .
it was a retirement gift for <#> years faithful service as an <UNK> <UNK> .
"unfortunately , his pride and joy still read <UNK> from the last time he checked it ."
the <UNK> clock that stood before the <UNK> hollow credit union read <UNK> .
he missed his doctor ’s appointment by <#> minutes .
the man <UNK> at the thought that he would have to pay a ‘
he twisted the crown backward and forward to <UNK> the watch movement then lifted the <UNK> to his ear as he stepped into a <UNK> .
his distress over the watch ’s mechanical failure was shattered by the sound of a powerful air horn .
the <UNK> <UNK> man jumped backward onto the sidewalk as a road wizard street sweeping machine <UNK> past him .
<UNK> wiped <UNK> off his <UNK> with a <UNK> .
he decided that a tasty treat would be better than a <UNK> retreat .
<UNK> first stopped at the coin shop which was <UNK> to the candy store .
the <UNK> was a coin <UNK> ’s heaven on earth .
the elderly <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> window and his eyes grew wide in <UNK> .
at the center of the display he saw a photograph of a coin from germany .
the coin had a <UNK> eagle <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> .
the actual coin rested on a <UNK> near the photo and an index card leaned against the <UNK> .
he walked to the <UNK> ’s door and turned the handle ; it would not open .
it was then that he saw a <UNK> written sign taped to the door .
he lowered his head and <UNK> over the top of his glasses to read the notice aloud : “
” he sighed and walked to ye <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"he <UNK> an <UNK> blend of chocolate , <UNK> , and cinnamon ."
"<UNK> nodded his head and said , “ <UNK> ."
<UNK> poured half a dozen <UNK> kisses from a plastic <UNK> into a small paper sack .
” the <#> - year - old <UNK> a tooth with his finger as he looked at all the sweet opportunities before him .
"<UNK> sticks , <UNK> , candy buttons , and peanut butter cups tempted the youth ."
<UNK> <UNK> up the sale and entered the amount on the cash register .
"“ <UNK> be <UNK> - <#> cents , please ."
kenny dug into his pants pocket and pulled out a <UNK> of coins .
several coins fell from his hand and <UNK> on the floor .
as the boy <UNK> to collect his stray coins he saw <#> quarter roll toward mr .
<UNK> who <UNK> placed a <UNK> shoe over the coin .
"“ s - schools not till next week , ” kenny said ."
the boy stood up accepting the fact that his quarter was no longer his .
he counted out <UNK> - <#> cents on the glass counter then put the remainder of his money back into his pocket .
<UNK> pushed the coins off the edge of the counter ; the coins fell into his hand . “
he <UNK> at the coin thief as he left the store .
"<UNK> said , pointing at a glass jar filled with <UNK> peanut butter cups ."
<UNK> <UNK> <#> peanut butter cups out of the glass jar mr .
<UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his ill - gotten gain .
“ <UNK> be <#> - <#> cents please . ”
<UNK> folded the top of the paper sack and handed it to his grumpy customer .
<UNK> paid for his treat with kenny ’s quarter .
the old cash register <UNK> and its drawer opened .
"“ <#> cents is your change , ” mr ."
<UNK> placed <#> <UNK> in the center of mr .
” the <UNK> of the silver bell was mr .
<UNK> popped a peanut butter cup into his mouth as he watched the traffic pass by .
he rolled the candy <UNK> into a tight ball and <UNK> it into the street .
he <UNK> the tasty blend of chocolate and peanut butter as he watched the <UNK> fall between the <UNK> of a storm drain .
he <UNK> to get a better look into the drain .
his <UNK> eyebrows lifted in surprise when he saw the <UNK> of a golden coin <UNK> from the <UNK> - <UNK> sand below .
he noted the close <UNK> of the <UNK> to the storm drain .
his heart rate <UNK> as he imagined some poor <UNK> <UNK> dropping the coin .
"in his mind ’s eye he saw the coin roll across the sidewalk and fall into the storm drain . that ’s his tough luck , thought mr ."
he <UNK> his <UNK> ; <UNK> it out onto the sidewalk ; then <UNK> on it .
he rested his right hand on the edge of the curb as he tried to squeeze his other hand between the <UNK> of the storm drain .
he noticed that the fingers of his right hand were folded into the curb .
he stepped into the street and looked at the curb .
there was a <UNK> opening cut into the concrete curb .
<UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> and reached into the opening .
it was a tight fit but his hand was closer to his nearly buried treasure .
an all - consuming desire for the coin <UNK> the man to do the <UNK> .
"as the afternoon traffic passed several feet from his head , mr ."
he stretched his arm as far as it would go .
the tip of his middle finger gently <UNK> the coin .
<#> <UNK> stood outside a mcdonald ’s restaurant as they shared a cigarette .
they spoke about the plans they had for the weekend .
"” <UNK> <UNK> smoke and said , “ that ’s no man , that ’s mr ."
its driver gave his <UNK> attention to the <UNK> <UNK> .
the girls waved back and seemed to be yelling at him .
the driver pointed at his ear and shook his head .
<UNK> glanced over his shoulder and saw the hungry <UNK> of the mechanical <UNK> heading straight for him .
the harder he pulled the arm the more firmly it remained <UNK> in place .
the driver got out of the truck and looked for the cause of the bump .
he asked her if she saw what just happened .
"“ there was a man lying on the ground by that drain , ” <UNK> said ."
they both saw carol staring into the drain ; they ran to her .
<UNK> ’s shoulder sticking out of the storm drain .
<UNK> ’s arm was <UNK> over the gold coin .
"blood <UNK> down the arm and <UNK> from all <#> fingers , creating a rough circle of blood around the coin ."
the driver looked back at his truck and understood where the rest of the man ’s body was .
he fell to his knees and <UNK> on the sidewalk .
it seemed to be reaching out for the coin as if determined to complete mr .
"the arm suddenly fell to the bottom of the storm drain and , either out of <UNK> or desire , the hand closed around the coin ."
it even looks like the corner is original and not just rock hard <UNK> !
"<UNK> , that purple <UNK> was n't the easiest to read , was it ."
"well for someone with an abundance of thoughts spilling out of her head , i 'm having difficulty committing to writing them down ."
"maybe it 's the heat , as we usually experience a much shorter summer ."
it 's not as green and <UNK> here as in previous summers .
my youngest son kevin has just returned from his week long summer camp .
i was abit <UNK> to find that he had certainly packed along a <UNK> controversial book for a christian based camp .
i 'm glad they did n't find it in his possession .
"they might 've freaked out just looking at it , ( <UNK> , legacy of blood ) ."
he 's almost <#> and plays <UNK> on the computer all the time .
it looks like a <UNK> grim <UNK> on the cover of it .
"ahh , the joys of a young teenage boy ."
"the sounds of his <UNK> pounding on a summer 's day , with our windows open for the <UNK> to enjoy ."
"the young teenage ' friend that is a girl ' that comes to call , all giggles and cute ."
"the anguish she 'll experience to leave her boyfriend behind , once again ."
"been there , done that , but what does a mom know ."
"i think she 's got it made , with her girlfriend in a great apartment downtown toronto ."
<#> girls going to school and experiencing life in a big city .
i do n't know too many young guys with a game plan at <#> .
"and that is alright , so they take abit longer to figure it out ."
why <UNK> them up forcing them to make decisions concerning women at such a young age ?
"but i am the mom , what do i know about such things ."
"he 's working full time , does <UNK> training <#> weeks out of the year , he 's doing ok , not too much to worry about there ."
his <UNK> days were when he was about <UNK> <#> .
"he 's got a very nice girlfriend , keeps him in line ."
real <UNK> are in the <UNK> tales of working in my dental office .
match <#> : he lives in the valley and is single with <#> grown kids .
we <UNK> comfortably and decide to meet in person .
"oh , by the way , he needs to tell me he has n't <UNK> in decades and is out of shape ... <UNK> much out of shape ?"
"<UNK> look like shrek "" match <#> : lives in la ."
"unemployed for the last <#> years ... <UNK> would like to be a writer . """
"in your spare time ? ? "" "" no . "" match <#> : nice looking guy ( at least he posted a picture ) lives near by ."
""" i am stupid and go for the second date ."
"almost everything i know about how to live , i learned in my music theory class ."
"yes , you can learn serious stuff in music theory ."
the most <UNK> lesson i learned is when to break the rules .
i did what i was supposed to do and did n't break too many rules .
"rules were big to me , but i learned that you ca n't camp on rules ..."
here 's the deal : everyone needs to learn the rules .
"rules about life , social rules , music rules ."
but once you know them it is critical that you learn when and how to break them .
"i had a professor who liked to tell us , "" you have to earn <UNK> ! """
"<UNK> is when you stretch a note , or <UNK> or change a note ."
his point was you have to know the music well before you can do these things .
this applies to all kinds of areas of life .
he went to the religious leaders and told them they had distorted the <UNK> ...
they needed to learn the principles behind them .... they even needed to learn to break a few .
you are n't living if you are n't breaking a few rules and breaking them well .
i am at the stage of life that i should be thinking of <UNK> and just being a <UNK> and doing the things i 've always dreamed of .
"oh well , i am going to school instead ."
"i have felt for a long time that i would eventually go back , but i waited for the right motivation ."
when my good friend died earlier this year i realized what i wanted to do .
i felt like standing next to her bed holding her hand and just being there for her was exactly where i was supposed to be .
i remember how many times she told me to follow my path ... even if i had to go back to school .
she said that women often do n't reach their full potential .
i do n't know when i have experienced a death that has left so many people with a hole in their hearts .
"ok , i am putting this question to the universe ."
where does mom - hood stop and <UNK> begin ?
"i think blogging is a great way to share thoughts , ideas , musings , etc ."
so i did n't think much about reading my kid 's .
it 's nice to experience them as adults who have their own thoughts and things to say .
who knows when they will teach me something valuable ?
"around the dinner table it is difficult to keep a good intellectual conversation going , but on a blog it is easier ."
is it a violation of privacy to read your family 's blogs ? ? ? ?
how about : i 'll show you mine if you show me yours ? ?
my third <UNK> is signs and the way people ignore them .
at <UNK> we have a <UNK> for the small shopping centre .
"<#> of the entries to the <UNK> has a "" no right turn "" sign on a post ."
no they do n't or <UNK> see it to their advantage .
another thing like this is <UNK> <UNK> on the driving area of the parking lots do people follow them ?
you can cross them when turning into a driveway .
lately a lot of people in <UNK> are crossing double <UNK> centre lines to do u turns and other stupid stuff .
about <#> minutes later we got our order and headed off .
"my writing here probably wo n't do <UNK> any justice , i havn't seen him live yet ."
this is his bio taken from the <UNK> website .
"usually beginning with a title or concept for a song , like a film director <UNK> a movie , mandy <UNK> began <UNK> <UNK> to match his visions ."
"gradually <UNK> his skill as a producer , mandy 's songs became individual worlds within themselves ."
"like the countless films he had <UNK> in his childhood , <UNK> took elements from everyday existence , twisted them hard , and integrated them into popular entertainment ."
he took the initial confusion and rejection in his <UNK> .
""" some of the work i did with chris was great"
"and i kept it , but the label and i agreed that we 'd lost something in the transition ."
we decided the best approach was to have someone <UNK> the original home <UNK> because they were already fully produced songs .
"they had my feel , my sound . """
"tony <UNK> ( the <UNK> , daniel <UNK> , christine <UNK> ) was the perfect choice to bring new <UNK> to the songs mandy had already <UNK> into life ."
the final <#> were <UNK> at the exchange in london under the title of tragic <UNK> .
"tragic <UNK> refers to the pure , early visions that <UNK> the creation of mandy <UNK> 's debut album ."
<#> singles from the album were released to <UNK> commercial success in <#> .
"the <UNK> - <UNK> stab was written from the perspective of the <UNK> angst - ridden , <UNK> teen with which mandy was all too familiar ."
"the lyrics were intended to be ironic - an attempt to show up how flawed the notion of teenage suicide really is . """
"billy bones followed , a fantasy piece heavily influenced by american cartoon culture ."
""" i 've never <UNK> to gothic culture , "" he says ."
""" i respect how those people choose to live , but i do n't represent them or anyone else ."
"both <UNK> and as a person , i find <UNK> to be terribly <UNK> ."
sometimes i see myself as an <UNK> teenager <UNK> with these <UNK> in my bedroom .
"hence , fantasy and reality <UNK> in a more <UNK> package than most pop critics see in a month of <UNK> ."
"in april <#> , a third single , stupid friday , is due to <UNK> any lingering <UNK> about mandy <UNK> yet again ."
""" stupid friday was inspired by the desire to change , to leave behind the person you once were , "" he says ."
the single also features a <UNK> by <UNK> .
mandy <UNK> 's ability to <UNK> his <UNK> sound live in another stunning <UNK> to his multi - <UNK> talent .
"a <UNK> sydney opera house audience , including <UNK> <UNK> , witnessed a stunning <UNK> at the australian <UNK> of "" the matrix revolution "" ."
"naturally , mandy has been <UNK> <UNK> by some of the finest <UNK> on the modern rock n ' roll stage ."
"in november , he <UNK> into machine gun <UNK> 's world of inspired <UNK> like a hand in a rubber <UNK> ."
"as real life catches up with the chronic <UNK> 's visions , mandy continues on a <UNK> path of creation ."
and we 're still just <UNK> through the <UNK> .
"in september of <#> , i was <UNK> through israel when i landed in the northern hill town of <UNK> ( aka <UNK> ) ."

"often , people arrive in <UNK> wanting to merely <UNK> , but end up moving there and dramatically changing their lives ."
for <UNK> i stayed at a hostel run by an <UNK> jewish organization providing free shelter in exchange for attendance at religious education classes held several times a day .
"in <UNK> , something happened , but i 've only recently figured out what it was ."
"indeed , nothing so dramatic happened during my entire visit ."
"and so i came to <UNK> a bit let down , but not without hope that i 'd pick up something of spiritual value ."
"it was in that spirit that i attended a morning class with a <UNK> whose name , sadly , never stuck with me ."
we spent the entire hour talking about the first line of the book of genesis .
"every word , of course , had numerous possible meanings as there is a great deal of interpretation that comes with <UNK> from hebrew ."
"<UNK> : <UNK> , do you really believe that heaven and earth were created in <#> days ?"
<UNK> : what about modern <UNK> that suggest the possibility that each of those <#> days actually lasted millions of years ?
"they were <#> - <#> hour days , just as we experience them today ."
"so , you actually believe that is has only been <#> years since heaven and earth were created ."
what about <UNK> date testing that shows <UNK> to be millions of years old ?
": scientists believe what they want to believe , and i believe what i want to believe ."
"on the surface , there was nothing remarkable about this <UNK> ."
"sure , he taught the classes in hopes that others might share the rewards of his faith ."
"yet , he had no desire to force his views on anyone ."
"so , it strikes me how different he was from other people i have met who <UNK> a deep , passionate faith ."
"it has been my <UNK> to have more than once been confronted by religious <UNK> , an entirely different practice in faith with a very different presentation ."
the <UNK> seems driven more by desperation than anything else .
"they have seen the light and operate from a place of panic , feeling that they are personally responsible for the salvation of others ."
i got a lot of <UNK> with that <UNK> and missed the point completely .
"in the end , it was more important that the <UNK> was <UNK> than whether or not he was right about the <UNK> of the universe ."

josh marshall made a urllink post to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe .
he talks about the tone of the democratic national convention as being <UNK> different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination .
<UNK> rhetoric against president bush was <UNK> rhetoric against compromise and <UNK> with him .
"in other words , it was to a very real degree aimed at other democrats ."
"second : anger is often , and rage is almost always , an emotion rooted in <UNK> ."
"that was certainly the position of democrats in early <#> ( on so many levels ) , though less so as the year went on ."
"the mood is <#> of <UNK> optimism that they can drive the president from office , that the wind is at their backs ."
"so , josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism ."
that certainly is a glass - half - full way to interpret it .
"what josh sees as a new found confidence , i see as <UNK> , tip - toe dancing around the swing voters ."
<UNK> spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism .
he had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed .
i find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in america are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous <UNK> .
"it is a classic american icon , yet somewhere along the line the democratic party decided that this formula does n't work ."
"yes , the media jumped all over howard dean for his post - iowa <UNK> rally ."
"the key , however , was how the dean campaign , and the democrats in general , <UNK> ."
"rather than defend the emotion that dean was showing , which i <UNK> was much more that of enthusiasm than anger , they apologized and <UNK> it down ."
"this is classic <UNK> , and the worst part is that it is self - <UNK> ."
"and that is no small matter for john kerry , the likely democratic <UNK> ."
kerry will head to boston - where the convention begins next monday - remembering and trying to <UNK> mr .
kerry has so far been unable to take advantage of <UNK> evidence that americans are looking for a change in the white house .
what is <UNK> above i stated was kerry 's <UNK> problem back in <UNK> ( not here but elsewhere as t - <UNK> had n't been around then ) .
that they have allowed themselves to become republicans in dress and democrats in name only is <UNK> .
how many more <UNK> must they run out there to be <UNK> ?
the <UNK> meter runs high around kerry in comparison to bush . and
"that meter often <UNK> elections ( no , really , it does ! ) ."
bush may be a word - <UNK> <UNK> on stage but he 's a sincere word - <UNK> <UNK> on and off stage .
voters who have doubts will go for the sincere <UNK> every time no matter how much he <UNK> things .
it has been <#> years since a convention really chose the candidate - when democrats in chicago nominated <UNK> <UNK> .
"over the next <#> years , conventions became the stage for presenting a running mate , as a way of keeping some interest in the event ."
even that little gift of news has slipped away over the years ; mr .
"granted , the conventions are more about <UNK> and <UNK> but never ( ? )"
before were the early primary returns allowed to run <UNK> over the entire primary process .
"the west coast <UNK> about early returns on the east coast affecting elections , well , what about <UNK> ? !"
"if it was n't for him , i 'd be voting same as i did in <#> , mickey and <UNK> mouse ."
do n't expect the <UNK> to change that matter .
that is unless the big <UNK> wisely allow john edward to run the show from here on out .
a reminder of the shell the democratic party has become .
copies <UNK> 's advertising and does n't <UNK> himself in the least .
he would n't want to do something the focus groups do n't approve .
"rather , a deer in the bed of the grand ol party 's <UNK> ."
this is <UNK> and i approved this blog .
"well , i done did n't do <UNK> ' ."
the fort was robbed and the <UNK> are gone .
"it 's all about <UNK> , the man with the vision ."
"well , there 's a handy tool to crunch those link - a - <UNK> - a - <UNK> - a - <UNK> down to something more reasonable ."
"the service , urllink <UNK> , can be placed in your ( browser 's ) links <UNK> ."
"in the meantime , i leave you with these few items : <#> . urllink update on michael moore 's blog ."
the pattern appears to continue as he 's only made <#> posts since his july 4th launch .
urllink sticks and stones will break my bones ...
i took real pleasure in reading about the sound ass - <UNK> ' the bush administration received at a recent benefit concert that raised $ <#> <#> .
"john <UNK> sang "" let me tell you a story about the texas <UNK> , "" a tune that referred to bush as a "" cheap <UNK> . """
"josh goes on to question what someone is doing operating a private jail , especially since it is very <UNK> who , if anyone , hired him ."
"sure , i see the intended humor , but i find myself very uncomfortable with the comparison ."
"all in all , a disturbing story if you choose to follow the link to the <UNK> urllink page it appears on ."
"urllink <UNK> , <UNK> were master <UNK> , taking ingredients from their <UNK> influences and <UNK> them up into the <UNK> of <UNK> ."
"yes , the influences are still there , but they are now <UNK> to background <UNK> or the occasional , brief keyboard or guitar lick ."
it will be very exciting to watch where they will go from here .
i do n't know whether to be amused or disturbed by this urllink article in tuesday 's ( <UNK> ) washington post .
on the surface it seems like a simple look at how silly things get in the world of domain names .
"<#> years ago , an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , kerry edwards , created his own web domain - urllink <UNK> . according to the article"
"john edwards would be kerry 's running mate , <UNK> edwards was called by the kerry campaign to discuss purchase of the domain name ."
"apparently , the asking price was too high ."
"so , it seems like a fairly harmless , humorous human interest story ."
"reading on we learn about other <UNK> who have purchased domain names , hoping to cash in : other obvious choices for a campaign web site –"
"– have already been registered , according to publicly available internet records ."
"and we , or at least i , wonder what is wrong with democracy in america ."
i 've mentioned urllink <UNK> * before --
"well , not here and maybe not on the web , wait ... -- but they just ripped out a great song on <UNK> ."
urllink my <UNK> - <UNK> urllink my <UNK> - real
urllink michael moore celebrated independence day by <UNK> a urllink blog .
it 's amazing that it took him so long since blogging seems like a natural fit for him .
"july 4th , <#> <UNK> pm my first blog entry hey , my first blog entry !"
blogging away for the common good or just to keep from watching whatever crap is on tv right now .
ca n't jon stewart do a sunday show ?
it will be interesting to see if he can keep it up .
"he 's tried an online diary before , and <UNK> to his email list can confirm that he regularly promises to write more often , but does not ."
it 's almost as if he thinks that writing best selling books and academy and <UNK> award winning movies is more important than communicating with his fans .
<#> way to read this news is to understand that the quality of each medium does not <UNK> focused attention . or
"btw , this is old news from march <#> ."
"if you feel you have been suspended in error or want to appeal this decision by providing additional information , please contact us . """
i have <UNK> no idea what kind of <UNK> thing that i may have do to <UNK> this type of rather offensive and <UNK> type of treatment .
you 're forced on to another email . )
"anyway , i 've not been checking my <UNK> email lately ."
apparently my credit card <UNK> and you sent me an email about it but i did n't get it .
then i notice that you <UNK> me almost to spam - like <UNK> to get your $ <#> on that <UNK> email .
"then , apparently because i did n't get the email i did n't realize the credit card i was using for ebay had <UNK> ."
"frankly , to be treated in this manner by you over $ <#> is downright shocking ."
have you and your <UNK> absolutely no sense of <UNK> or simple common sense ?
"$ <#> , to most <UNK> would be treated with a kind <UNK> that would encourage people to continue being their customers ."
as most people would assume that $ <#> is certainly not enough to actually be what the problem might be .
who would <UNK> destroy themselves over $ <#> ?
"sane people would not act insane and send out <UNK> of spam over it , nor treat their customer with such <UNK> upon their next visit to their establishment ."
"instead they might just forget it , or more likely , casually mention it while the <UNK> was shopping ."
who would want such a monster in their midst ?
they 're certainly in the same class of human destruction .
they certainly should both be <UNK> to their own little island for the duration of their lives .
"but we 're talking about me , <UNK> $ <#> <UNK> that i seem to be in your eyes ."
"so , lets talk about this $ <#> ."
you 've <UNK> me from trying to pay you .
are you even interested in me as a customer anymore ?
"and , god , what is all this "" serious violation "" stuff that <UNK> me being kick from your eden ?"
where i work i bill no less than $ <#> an hour .
i 've spent a good <#> hours at least trying to determine what you 've done to my account and how to correct it using your system .
"gee , is n't it only the <UNK> that demands every penny or else ? ..."
".... break a few of my <UNK> .... put "" the hurt "" on my poor granny ? )"
"so , again , what do you want from me ."
you 've <UNK> me <UNK> ( as i discovered opening my <UNK> email account for the first time in a while today ) .
you 've wasted a lot of my time and should really be paying me the net of $ <#> that you really owe me now .
"tell me you 're still , at the core , of flesh and blood like the rest of us ."
"i 'll be checking my <UNK> email for a while , just to see what you will do ."
"i do not find any truth or value in any religion or in any form of religion , or in any religious - like belief structures ."
religion is the most destructive force on the planet today .
it has been the most destructive force for thousands of years .
teaching a child lies is a terrible form of child abuse .
religion is much too dangerous for children to be exposed to .
"it is something that only adults , like tobacco , alcohol and other adult activities , should be allowed to pursue ."
"our children need protection from religion until they are <#> , have become legal adults and are able to decide for themselves if they wish to join a religion ."
religion is the most addictive drug ever created by mankind .
we must begin and complete a campaign to get laws passed which protect our children from this vicious cycle .
"i fully support an adult 's right to control their body , and joining a religion is an individual choice an adult can make for themselves if they wish ."
i see no reason to deny an adult the right to join a religion if he or she chooses .
"like any drug , adults decide all the time what drugs are right for them ."
"but , for children , it 's a different matter ."
nothing is being done to protect our children from this <UNK> child abuse .
most religions offer the most <UNK> and unbelievable <UNK> <UNK> .
i can see how this lie would be hard for an adult to resist .
"i can not imagine how a child could resist it , nor be able to give it up when he grew up ."
"he became addicted to it as a child and will have to live his life in the slavery of addiction , which is what religion really is ."
"the <UNK> insanity brought on by by religion is an illness so <UNK> in our society that it 's not even , yet , seen as an illness ."
our society is in the grip of this destructive mental illness .
we must begin to start treating it as such .
"a destruction it is <UNK> on all of us , every day ."
"let 's work to make laws to protect our children from religion , just as we protect them from tobacco and alcohol and drugs ."
"lets work to get the illness of religious addiction defined , and then work to find <UNK> for the terrible insanity it <UNK> upon its victims ."
denying a child the truth is denying the child mental health .
"the theft of a child 's mental health meets the definition of crime because it meets the natural test for a crime , theft ."
"people who lie to children willingly and <UNK> are , in fact , and in terms of natural law , criminals ."
knowing they were taught as children to behave in this criminal manner towards their own children presents an enormous challenge to the mental health professionals in this country .
"we are born into this world with only <#> thing , our bodies ."
"when we die , we take only <#> thing , our bodies ."
"in between , my only <UNK> is to be the supreme and final ruler over what is <UNK> to happen to , on , or in my body ."
"this <UNK> is , in fact , freedom itself ."
the free individual <UNK> what may happen to their body by <UNK> or <UNK> their consent .
"a natural government has but <#> duty , to protect the <UNK> of its individuals ."
the reverse of freedom is to cause others to lose their freedom .
a government has only <#> natural reason to exercise a power of majority .
that is to notice when <#> individual has imposed their will upon another individual without the consent of the imposed upon individual and to <UNK> the <UNK> .
any other reason used to take control of the individual 's <UNK> away from the individual is a <UNK> of the power of majority .
this means that there is only <#> crime that it is possible to commit .
theft occurs when an individual takes something owned by another individual without the consent of the owner .
"this includes taking another person 's property , health , or life ."
"anything , which can not be considered theft , as defined here is , in fact , not a real crime at all ."
"any laws , which can not be considered theft as defined here , are not natural laws ."
it is thus up to the individual to protest <UNK> laws that grasp at his <UNK> .
"as long as a majority continues to grasp for control of the individual 's <UNK> , the struggle for freedom must continue ."
all laws that <UNK> anyone from choosing any drug to take into their body are <UNK> laws and oppose the very essence of freedom .
what i choose for my body is my business .
a crime can only be committed if i force my will upon another without their consent .
<#> can only commit a crime if his actions impose his will upon another without the other 's consent .
our government is <UNK> drug laws that have no basis in the protection of freedom .
"these laws are not natural laws , and are therefore themselves crimes being <UNK> against the american people by its government ."
our government is in violation of its only duty by <UNK> <UNK> laws upon drug users .
"however , over time , our government has also been slowly coming to the realization that the individual 's <UNK> must be protected ."
this can be seen in the history of the evolution of human rights in this country .
"in the last <#> years , we have begun to see a small beginning of <UNK> by our government of a human 's <UNK> ."
the recent court decision <UNK> <UNK> laws is another small step towards the return of the individual 's <UNK> .
the right to control our bodies is our only <UNK> .
"it is , in fact , freedom itself ."
"this is the fundamental reason for a democracy to exist , so that the people may protect this most basic of all human rights ."
nothing else is as important as when the people exercise their democratic right to retain control of their bodies .
beware all who lay claim to any part of your <UNK> . without your <UNK>
it will only be <UNK> when the people <UNK> their <UNK> .
"it 's july 4th , <#> and this is the first day and the first post of my first blog , elder duck down ."
"what i hope to accomplish here is to breath life into my thoughts on the nature of <#> human topics : freedom , and sanity ."
i hope my ideas will cause those whose eyes are closed to open them .
now i need to credit barbara taylor <UNK> for giving me the inspiration for the title of the blog .
"but , after <#> months i had other things to do and took my list of remaining <#> books down from <UNK> ."
"so , <#> quiet <UNK> evening at home i felt like reading something light and picked up her book ."
"the story , though predictable , was an easy read and kept my attention ."
i thought and thought and thought about elder duck down .
and i thought about freedom and sanity and where we get our ideas about those things .
"and i thought about comfort , and how expensive it is ."
"many have never even imagined elder duck down , and many have heard of it but never experienced it so do n't believe ."
so they teach their children to believe what they believe .
"still , there is something better should they try and find it ."
but <UNK> are light and its quite a feat for a person to collect enough to experience it and <UNK> their old beliefs .
but old men and old women are uncomfortable to learn their beliefs were <UNK> .
and so they end their lives as <UNK> as when they began .
"lost in the drug of belief , eyes tightly closed to reality ."
"though here is the only place it can be seen , when the elders duck down , here these words will be ."
and it will <UNK> the way for those who have been <UNK> from belief .
"here 's my <UNK> for the coming week from urllink sf gate : "" if i knew then what i know now . """

"things seemed fine for the first <#> weeks , then last week she was having confused spells during the calls , but then <UNK> up ."
"and she called me back today , as planned , to tell me what she 'd found out ."
"maybe it was the staff , maybe it was her , maybe it was nothing ."
for a while i was getting used to the idea of spending <#> weeks in the house back home ...
"no tv , internet only in the public library , no computer , nothing to do , but"
it had seemed before last week that she just might be able to be in the house there .
but i 've also considered the prospect of bringing her here .
"after all , i 'm not sure how much nursing home we can afford ."
best case : to a first floor <#> bedroom <#> bathroom apartment here .
but i do n't know if they have <UNK> .
"bringing her here might mean a new apartment , or more likely buying a house ."
"but , if that 's the case , maybe i wo n't even have to do that , and that she 'll go to a nursing home after all ."
but then i 'll still be clearing out the house and selling everything .
there 's no way to know really what 's going to happen .
"as horrible as it sounds , the best would be if she had a health crisis before she 's <UNK> from the hospital ."
"but , the real point is that there 's a chance my life will change ."
"i do n't know how , i do n't even know entirely if ."
i do know that i can not * move * back home .
"if she ca n't move here ( and , really , there 's the plane ride , including changing planes at <UNK> ."
and that 's just the beginning ) and spends time in a nursing home
", i have no <UNK> left , which was to be my retirement fund ."
"i 'm at the end of a <#> week vacation , the first real time away i 've had all fall ."
"another week at java training in late october , though this was local , so no overnight traveling ."
almost a week in <UNK> in early november .
funny how things are so often both worse and better than expected .
"she was in the hospital until early september , and then moved into a local <UNK> living facility , which is a wonderful facility and surprisingly priced ."
i could find a nice apartment for not much less than that price .
"more importantly , it 's a * nice * place -- clean , nicely <UNK> and decorated , and the people there really care ."
i had n't visited mom at the house for a long time .
"i did n't really want to , but she did n't really want me to either ."
"but , if i 'd gone there , i would have been unable to let her live that way , but <UNK> to make her change ."
better to have been able to live in ignorance all that time .
"and , though she fell , it was n't a serious injury , and that was the only thing that would have gotten her out of the house ."
"with the bathroom floor the way it is making the bathroom <UNK> , when i go back home i do n't have to stay in the house ."
"it 's been an <UNK> experience , going back home ."
"having been away so long , so much was <UNK> , yet instantly familiar at the same time ."
"those streets , the style of architecture , the <UNK> ."
"well , i bought some potato salad from the local grocery store -- <UNK> made , but still -- and it tasted just like mom 's ."
"i do n't think mom has <UNK> 's per se , but she does have mental confusion on a relatively regular basis ."
"i <UNK> this confusion as a factor in a variety of things , particularly the poor ( you might say ) decisions regarding how she lived in the house ."
"but , being a pack rat is not new ."
"anyway , i found that keeping everything is not anywhere new ."
"i think the most <UNK> to me was the empty medicine bottles , my grandmother 's prescription , from <#> ."
"second , or maybe equal , was the clean and <UNK> folded paper labels from <UNK> goods ."
"my thought : i was raised by a crazy woman , who was <UNK> , <UNK> in affection ."
mom herself was adopted by probably the worst choice of mother .
"at least it ends here , with this generation ."
thank god i do n't have a child to pass all this on to .
"i swear , the place was out of the sims ."
"that is , in the game , there are these weird things : chairs , etc ."
", and <UNK> and <UNK> elements that i 've just thought were weird -- like , who would have that stuff in their house ?"
"well , "" who "" would be people who live in <UNK> valley ."
but the past <#> months have been really <UNK> .
"i knew it was -- i saw the signs , but there was n't anything to do but wait for the holidays ."
but this is what 's depressing : the good men are not my age anymore .
joan <UNK> is <#> years older than me .
whereas <UNK> antonio <UNK> is <#> years younger than me .
i suppose it 's unfair to make the comparison .
"i mean , <UNK> antonio <UNK> is fucking gorgeous . but still ."
"bryan ( my ex ) was there , and we were in a house ."
"he had said something about having to wait to see if the rocket moved , but i did n't know what he meant ."
"then later there was some kind of <UNK> he got , and i asked what was wrong and he said the rocket had moved ."
"he looked outside and there was someone there , caught in something and struggling ."
"we went down but we could n't help , and there was some kind of explosion , but all we could have from him was his lower jaw ."
then we went back inside and bryan was very <UNK> getting ready for whatever it was .
then i saw some kind of map and called for him to come over .
"he 'd been destroying things in the house , <UNK> them up with a knife ."
when he saw the map he calmed down a little and seemed to focus .
"he was still destroying things , but it was more like <UNK> or <UNK> things in the house , getting ready for whatever was coming ."
i have n't seen this kind of <UNK> in a dream before .
there was a part of the dream that i 'd seen in a dream before though .
"in <#> part , before the above , it was still with bryan i think , or someone anyway , some guy ."
"and i was walking there through a building , like a large hotel or a mall which i 'd been at before on <#> occasions ."
"i got lost trying to find my way to the place where they served breakfast , even though i recognized the place ."
i remembered that i had gotten lost there before .
"on <#> hand , i still occasionally get <UNK> when buying beer in the <#> - eleven ."
"strangers who meet me generally put me somewhere in my <UNK> . yet , in about a month , i 'll have my <UNK> birthday ."
i have a growing awareness that i 'm approaching what might be called old -- some would say i am already old .
"i 'm not talking about physically in this case , but rather the awareness of the years of experiences i 've had ."
what 's weird now is me in relation to the people around me .
"under the <UNK> of humans experiencing only the universe they <UNK> , information transfer and flow remains within the closed system of the individual universe ."
"humans have generally <UNK> this in the form of "" <UNK> time "" and "" cause and effect "" ."
the world as a flat object used to be real until enough humans shared a different perception of the earth .
"continuing with the article i <UNK> in my previous post : "" in the <UNK> , however , there are <UNK> ; the <UNK> possibilities really happen """
"this is the famous double - <UNK> experiment , the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> from the <UNK> realm such as <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> are fired at the first plate , which has <#> vertical <UNK> in it ."
the <UNK> that go through hit the second plate on the far side .
imagine the places that are hit show up black and that the places that are not hit show up white .
"to make it , <UNK> that passed through <#> <UNK> have to interfere with <UNK> that passed through the other <UNK> ."
the pattern simply does not form if you shut <#> <UNK> .
"the strange thing is that the <UNK> pattern forms even if <UNK> come <#> at a time , with long periods in between ."

still how does this really help us from not acting upon getting revenge ?
praying is maybe the only thing that i have found to really help .
"i have tried other methods , however ; to no avail came to realize that i still have to look in the mirror ."
and then i try and cover it up with new hair cut or color .
"still , i realize it is still me in that mirror ."

"to have a faith that is real , vital , and life changing <#> must only "" fix "" ones eyes on the beautiful son ."
"i must confess that i have made both choices in my life , both to <UNK> my gaze , and unfortunately turning from god with my gaze becoming dull ."
we sit and pay a small fortune for gas each day and wonder what we can do about it .
we hear supply and demand and then send food to the same people who want us to pay more each day for gas .
"the same people who charge us what ever they want for thier oil , expect us to send them food that our farmers grew ."
they will say we have to feed our people and we send them what they need .
"we say we need your oil , and they slow down production ."
if our prices go up they make more money .
if they want more to eat we send it to them .
"here is a thought , if they want somthing to eat , drink a nice big glass of oil ."
"what , you say that will not keep you alive ?"
well how about i will give you a piece of bread for a gallon of gas .
would you like some water to wash that down with ?
you see in my opinion we can last longer with out oil than they can last with out food .
supply and demand needs to go in both directions .
we cut the supply to lower the need for food .
"after enough <UNK> to death , they will want to trade on our terms ."
food can be the great <UNK> in the battle over oil .
"i have been watching as more and more of our people and the people of our friends are killed not in war , but by <UNK> animals ."
"these people are being killed to scare our people , and make us want to get rid of the present government that is leading us ."
we as a people must stay together on this .
however they also need to do somthing to stop the needles deaths of people who are trying to help the cause .
there is only <#> way to let the animals know that we are not going to take it any more .
cut off <#> head of a terrorist for each <#> they have cut .
take <#> out the the middle of <#> of thier cities and take his head off .
"make sure that it is seen , by the people and let them know it will happen each and every time the do it to <#> of our people ."
well i am not sure what to say except that today other than the missed cal from liz is starting out to be a spectacular day !
"first off , lucas made my week yesterday by coming down out of the blue just to see me !"
he <UNK> had plans with friends back home that evening ...
i mean he left his work in the middle of the day to drive about an hour or so to come see me .
plus he is coming down to spend the day with me and my kids today .
ok so lets get this dark note out of my day .
i do nt what the deal is but i was asleep last night and missed a call from lizzie .
she was crying and very upset and i do nt need <#> <UNK> to know why !
he can be soo fun and sweet and then such a little ass at the same time .
he really enjoys being mean to her and they are the best of friends .
sometimes i wonder if he is using her as a <UNK> experiment ?
"i had strange dream last night that i will go into later , but for now ..."
yes i chose not to be too offensive in writing .
yes i do love <UNK> and probably watch too much !
"they are kind <UNK> to let me know that not only do i need new breaks , but that i also <UNK> a new sway ( <UNK> ) bar !"
i am thinking ' oh shit ' about this time .
well i guess it is <UNK> until the part comes in because it is a dealer only purchase ... <UNK> !
of course i cal mom for the credit card because it is going to cost nearly $ <#> to correct !
ok well the damage is actually less than i was expecting so i am not in a total freak out ...
i am so looking forward to finishing school next july so i can get a job and afford to be human again !
"not rich , but dammit .... human at least ."
"so there is this lab job i really want ... not my first choice , but i would learn some <UNK> skills and be doing lab work ."
wel sperm washing is not on the top of my list for fun .... lol ! ! ! !
i am really tired lately and have decided that tests in the morning are a bad idea for me .
i took my c <#> - <#> quiz and got a d !
f * * * ! not too happy about that <#> .
i must say that i do nt think <UNK> are very practical .
ok so i am a dork ... best known now because its sooooo true .
<UNK> <UNK> is excellent even if you do nt like fish - very <UNK> and does nt taste <UNK> at all !
my pal lizzie did nt come see me at school today !
"sure she skipped class ( with a decent reason ) , but she did nt think i was important <UNK> to drive to school still and hang out with ..."
"i of course am not , but so be it ."
<UNK> is still an excellent outlet for me and a great sounding board for thoughts that are making me <UNK> ... which is generally all the time !
this afternoon i have to call and check on a few <UNK> to see if i am even being considered .
.... hell maybe i will live in a hut and do the 18th century thing ... seems to be the big thing .
i do nt think killing my own food would go to well either ... just the killing part .
"i mean i have helped skin a deer and prepare the meat , but killing ...... <UNK> ! ! ! !"
i think i would have to go with road kill or become a <UNK> .
i have all sorts of stupid shit <UNK> around in my head ... and this is all day most everyday .
tho i do understand now <UNK> men say they are thinking of nothing
"cause it has happened and honestly , its kind of nice !"
that is <#> i could go on forever about !
"women have some things so much better , but then men have other things so much better ."
to be honest in the end i think it <UNK> out .
now that would piss off the <UNK> <UNK> and lesbians !
"sorry gals , but i have right to my opinion !"
that is what they stood for is nt it ?
everything can be a <UNK> <UNK> sword and its all about perspective .
glad i had a way to waste some time tho . later !
"ok so i do n't have too much to talk about , but i am here anyway . made a few comments to people on here"
so we will see if i make any new friends or enemies .
the boy was a real pain this morning and has skipped camp once again to come to school with me .
"we do have the perfect set up tho ... we actually have our own lives and space , with time to miss eachother <UNK> to have"
you know i am not sure if anyone actually reads these or not .
"i do some , but not all .... <UNK> that s a lot of time online i 'd say ."
"i have people i chat with and all , but i get sick of it and feel a bit trapped by my comp ."
"i feel that way about people too on <UNK> , but not nearly as often or <UNK> ."
on top of the fact that i have no money ... being a student and all .
you would think he could get off his ass and give a shit to pay that little bit !
of course now the state is tracking him down to go to court and he thinks i am after him ....
does n't he realize that when i knew we could n't get back together that i had already given up on him ? ?
i just do nt have the time or energy to deal with him any longer .
"also , they do nt have to learn some very disappointing habits and that is worth a lot ."
so i am now finished on the soap box .
i think it is bothering me because the court date is the 15th and i have to go again and that means time from class .
so me and <UNK> well lets say we are both at our <UNK> and some people are a bit shocked to meet a couple like <UNK> and <UNK> .
lucas is pretty good with my kids especially for someone as young as he is and yes he is of age ... hahaha !
"very responsible too , i think he is a decent role model for my kids at this <UNK> in our lives ."
a <UNK> sent me a cool pick of a rainbow just after .
"i will put it up soon , but i am not on the home comp so it wo nt do much good to try now ."
"i watched the butterfly effect , decent movie actually , i liked it and so did my son ."
"speaking of which , are all boys the <UNK> "" mama 's boys "" , because josh worries me at times ."
i hope he grows out of it tho so he can get thru life without me always picking up the <UNK> .
well those seem to be all the thoughts rambling around in my head today so later !
well today has been good so far and rather productive .
got a few more <UNK> out there and hope to hear something from somewhere ...
"i mean <#> ca nt actually be "" <UNK> "" can they ?"
i absolutely love that class and the labs as well !
i am considering work in that field now ... and it has even made dna interesting to me ... but the <UNK> are what calls to me .
liz was pissed because i did nt actually mention her in my notes here ...
actually she is part of most of my days so you will get to know her .
do know this ... she is very proud of her breasts !
"lucas , my bf is almost too good to be true and there is alot there to know about us ... so"
when you hear these names later you know who i am referring to .
my kids are all doing camp stuff this summer and are as awesome as they are a pain ....
never thought i could see anyone both ways . ? ? ? ?
not sure if i will ever post pics of them as that kind of makes me nervous .
i do have to say that <UNK> proudly <UNK> the other day while hiking that she does not pee on others only herself !
my dog is officially too old to hike i think ... the old <UNK> .
i am silly <UNK> to probably try the wagon next time .
i do nt have many <UNK> unless it involves my life so complaining is nt my genre .
just chatting away and maybe make a few friends .
i do mean animals ... they are somewhat <UNK> tho .
why is it that when you finally find exactly what you are looking <UNK> you have to say goodbye practically as soon as you 've said hello ?
"but , details will come later , as i 'm absolutely <UNK> and want to go to bed ! crap"
"a fellow beatles fan told me about it today , and told me to google it ."
"i did , and read a lot of the stuff , and it really <UNK> me out ."
i ca n't believe that i had never heard this stuff before !
"hey , i saw paul in concert about <#> years ago ."
it 's amazing how these crazy ideas get started .
i had to make myself take a nap today .
"there was so much for me to do today , and i just had all this energy suddenly , and just could n't stop going !"
"finally , at about 2:30 , i stopped and rested , and slept for about an hour and a half ."
i know that in a few hours i 'm going to be <UNK> again !
guess i 'll sleep in the car tomorrow !
"i took my friends out to dinner tonight , in honor of their <#> year anniversary , which is tomorrow ."
we had a great night ! a very nice dinner
"( yes , i went off my diet to enjoy it , but i was n't too bad . )"
"the next <#> days will be the hardest , since i wo n't be at home ."
eating on the go is never a good thing .
now that i have that off my chest i guess i can get on with todays blog .
too bad there is n't anything worth reading out there .
friends of ours from <UNK> are comming to stay with us for a while .
their actual vacation plans got screwed up beyond repair so their final desperation choice was our place .
took my son and his friend to the community pool today .
this was the first time i had been there .
the tits on <#> of the <UNK> were pretty nice also .
i was n't allowed to smoke near the outside pool
so i had to travel through the main building and out the front doors to get my <UNK> fix .
i just ate <#> pizza pockets but i 'm still hungry .
<UNK> ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"i 'm not really unhappy , just frustrated and fucked ."
my wife says then i <UNK> ( sp ) into a <UNK> .
but she is sitting right beside me so i will humor her .
but she says it is n't period cramps just dull aches that wo n't come out .
she said the <UNK> thing as i am hairy .
wow she comes up with some good ones does n't she .
you see i am on <UNK> . a drug that is given to people ( and lab rats ) that stops you from going deeper into depression .
"the side effects include <UNK> , a sense of <UNK> , and the inability to cum !"
this is why my wife is a very happy person .
to see a picture of my wife 's <UNK> collection click here urllink sorry boys that link thing did n't work .
lets try that again here urllink i 'll have to work on that link .
i guess i 'll go for now as i am feeling <UNK> and need to jerk off .
sorry if i offended you but if you ca n't take a joke fuck you !
in the next episode you will hear about the time i <UNK> all the <#> <UNK> <UNK> from a kfc <UNK> .
i 'm often a johnny - come - lately .
i 'm already familiar with his work but wondered what else he had done .
and the first of the search results <UNK> a ' blog ' entry by ... you guessed it ... william gibson .
"... drove me to adopt a blog , on this service , the same used by william gibson ."
so what are these reasons for finally creating a blog ?
to tackle the <UNK> first : i need a place to share my thoughts .
"my thoughts are me ; hence , to share myself ."
"i do n't claim that it makes me an interesting person , yet others have expressed interest ."
i also would like a place to put odd little bits of writing .
"i am a writer , yet passages come and go for me which do not qualify for <UNK> anywhere else , or in published print elsewhere ."
"and , what is a blog , but a journal ?"
i have been doing journal entries since i was a boy .
"that main , ' <UNK> ' reason for having a weblog ... that , i will cover in my next entry ."
i feel kind of guilty after my last posting .
"it 's funny , you know , because i did n't write about anything that had not been on my mind for months ."
"but i guess that , somehow , put feelings in writing <UNK> to fully <UNK> them ."
"i had the <UNK> of <UNK> the whole post , the whole blog ."
i thought that maybe i should write only about everyday things and keep my feelings to myself . but then thought that that was ridiculous .
"i mean , <#> can be pretty anonymous around here , if that 's what <#> wants ."
and the chances of someone from my real world stumbling here and <UNK> me are <UNK> .
"and for all i knew , maybe no <#> would ever read this blog ."
"but i felt guilty about having written about the ex , and about my feelings for my husband , for anyone anywhere to read it ."
maybe i felt as if i was <UNK> him .
i suppose this is the same feeling that has kept me from seeing a shrink .
"i have always been a very <UNK> person , who would only <UNK> in a few friends of many many years ."
the idea of talking about my most inner secrets to someone unknown is still a shock for me .
"now that i think about it , i even wonder how did i <UNK> make the decision of starting this blog ."
i guess i was pretty sure that no <#> would read it !
"so , an ex - boyfriend called today . not any ex , mind you , but the ex ."
"i suppose i should n't make a fuss over it , and in some way , i do n't ."
"then i got married , he got married and moved out of town , and we sort of lost contact ) ."
", <#> would be wondering what on earth do i think i 'm doing ."
"well , to be honest , i 'm not happily married ."
"well , this guy was the love of my life , you see ."
i never ever loved anyone the way i loved him .
"on top of that , we had the most amazing chemistry i 've ever seen ."
"i 'd never felt like that before , and i have not felt like that since ."
"just for the record , i did love my husband when we got married ."
"but too much has happened , so for now i only feel affection for him , that 's all ."
"actually , when you think about it , it 's quite depressing ... !"
i guess i 'll be writing more on this later .
"who knows , maybe putting these things on "" paper "" will help me ."
i want to be <#> of those old <UNK> who wears <UNK> because they 're comfortable and wears her hair long even though it 's gone grey .
is it weird that i 'm looking forward to aging ?
"i mean , i 'm not looking forward to aches and pains , and i 'm not hoping to rush the process or anything ."
"but it seems like i will feel less pressure to be "" pretty "" when i 'm old ."
"but i think it 's terribly difficult to be young and not fit cultural standards , physically speaking ."
people look at you more when you 're young .
it 's when you 're supposed to be finding a mate and <UNK> your fairy tale ending .
"a task that poor self esteem makes quite <UNK> , i must add ."
"when you 're old , all that stuff is -- supposedly -- over and done ."
it 's easy to <UNK> this way from <#> years old .
"just wanted to say a quick hi , and i 'm here , and i 'll be back . like the <UNK> ;)"
it seems like i am always setting myself up for failure .
"i set goals -- sometimes tiny , sometimes enormous and <UNK> -- and when i fall short , i feel guilty ."
"guilt and <UNK> , for me , go hand in hand ."
i think i have built up a resentment to the entire concept of <UNK> because of the guilt
"it 's a bit silly really , because i have had self - imposed <UNK> restrictions for as long as i can remember ."
just a short note by me testing this out and letting you know i 'm here .
here 's the deal : i have never been <UNK> material .
i look at women who spend their days on the <UNK> and my mind <UNK> .
"i ca n't be all bad , because i 've had boyfriends , and people tell me i 'm pretty quite frequently ."
"but i do n't feel attractive , and i have n't for as long as i can remember ."
"i have never been , in my <UNK> , a pretty girl ."
but why the fuck am i so hard on myself ?
"when did life become a constant obsession with <UNK> , instead of something to be lived and loved and enjoyed ?"
when did atkins become more important than god ?
"i recently met a man on the internet , and he 's really wonderful ."
i 'm so enjoying getting to know him that we 're <UNK> to meet in person in early autumn .
already i 'm worrying -- will i compare to other women he 's been with ?
"you i went through all of these worries with my ex boyfriends , and it was all for <UNK> ."
i 've been thinking a lot about relationships lately .
"specifically , i 've been thinking about what i bring to the table , and why i have a hard time selling myself to potential partners ."
i 've been blessed to have some really meaningful relationships in my short life .
"and i think they 've <UNK> <UNK> , too ."
i 've learned a lot about how i behave in a <UNK> with another human being .
"all in all , i think i make a pretty good <UNK> ."
i read through <UNK> <UNK> and a lot of men are looking for the sort of things i have to offer .
"i ca n't take all the credit for my development , though ."
i have friends who do a great job at <UNK> my ego !
"however , the <#> <UNK> of fat she lost still left her among south florida 's overweight pets , said to be <#> - <UNK> of their population ."
"as <UNK> 's owner was reminded , surgery is not to be a substitute for sensible exercise and a modest number of treats ."
"[ palm beach post , <#> - <#> - <#> ] urllink click here for more what the heck ?"
"they 're doing <UNK> in the stupidest places on people now , but dogs ? dogs ?"
"self - esteem , for me , seems to come and go ."
"almost as <UNK> as depression ( which , <UNK> , i have n't suffered from in quite some time ) ."
sometimes my self - confidence shifts multiple times in a day .
somehow that all <UNK> over to my body image and i feel better about myself .
probably more <UNK> about myself -- because i am my own worst critic .
"if i am with someone <UNK> i can easily feel good about myself , if not great about myself ."
"written out like this it sounds rather sad , but i can relate to that ."
having someone fancy me makes me feel like maybe i 'm decent human being material after all .
many people tell me that <#> <UNK> of depression is a lack of <UNK> .
"for it , it 's always been the exact opposite ."
"when i 'm very depressed , i am <UNK> , because giving another person pleasure makes me feel good about myself ."
"i get a sort of high from it , not unlike being <UNK> on drugs or alcohol . as a general matter of course"
i love sex and i love making a man feel good . even when i 'm not depressed
", nothing makes me feel <UNK> than to watch a man 's face when i 'm doing something naughty to him ."
"but sex , to me , is only good when it 's with someone i care about ."
i ca n't <UNK> the same boost of self - confidence from attempting to please someone i know nothing about .
it just feels hollow and lacking in any substance .
"when i am not depressed , sex becomes almost a holy act , for me ."
"meanwhile , as i continue to make positive changes and sound steps forward , i am finding my self - confidence creeping towards a better place ."
here is a picture of me at my <UNK> .
this is what i 'm supposed to look like according to all of those wonderful - happy charts .
( can you see the circles under my eyes ? )
"anyone with a body mass index of <#> or above - such as someone who is <UNK> and <#> pounds - is considered <UNK> . """
""" is n't that happy news ? ?"
it made me think of me <UNK> back when i was a teenager ( <#> years ago ) .
i was <UNK> because i never felt like i was good enough .
"i was always too fat , too short , too stupid , too something , too anything , too nothing ."
"but then i read articles like the <#> i quoted , and i end up feeling completely <UNK> ."
i looked like i had <#> foot in the grave .
reading this made me think of <UNK> 's post about self - image .
"the american woman is <UNK> almost constantly with images and sound - bites about diet and appearance , or at least it seems that way ."
"ultra - thin women on magazine covers , in <UNK> ."
"<UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , <#> % of which never work ."
"i admitted that to myself a couple of years ago and <UNK> thought , "" ha !"
"i admitted it , now maybe i can lose weight ! """
i 've gained <UNK> since then . and lost it . and gained it back . and lost it .
maybe i 've stuck that into the back of my head and my <UNK> hangs on to that for some reason .
i do know that at <#> point i lost <UNK> i 'm not sure how .
"i do know , though , that <UNK> of it came right back ."
"i do n't <UNK> ; in fact , if anything , i do n't eat as much as i should ."
i drink almost <#> <UNK> of water every day .
"i do n't eat a lot of candy , but what candy i do eat is the new kinds which are <UNK> with <UNK> ."
i 've cut my caffeine consumption down by <#> % - something i thought i 'd never do nor ever be able to do .
i stopped smoking this time last year ; i do n't even crave cigarettes .
"i do yoga every day , and i <UNK> like a <UNK> once a week ."
": at this point , i honestly do n't know what i 'm doing"
( which sets off my anxiety problems .... ) anyway .
"i 'm glad this blog is here just for this , and that we 're here to help and support each other ."
"so , i turned <#> this year , got out of a bad relationship ( with a man i <UNK> ) very much ) and started therapy ."
not being inclined to pick up the pen i figure this is just as effective .
i started the therapy sessions in order to get over the aforementioned love .
this in no way <UNK> the pain that i <UNK> feeling .
i came to the realization that the reason i was really there was to address other deeper issues that .... blah blah blah .
this must be the most boring topic of all time to someone not involved .
drinking was the way i related to others .
"i would go out after work for a "" <UNK> "" ( quick <#> ) with a few friends ."
it was n't unusual to end up the night at <#> or <#> am .
"that was just the <UNK> , then there were the weekends ."
not to mention the occasional drug use that accompanied the booze .
when my relationship broke up i started drinking more heavily .
( i am <UNK> the relationship for the time being but will get into that only slightly more interesting story later . )
it has been <#> and a half weeks since my last drink .
i am still very much in the counting days phase .
"i know , i know , "" <#> day at a time "" and all that ."
and by saying that i do n't in any way mean to be <UNK> of those wise words .
"i have huge problems with the notion of "" <UNK> "" ."
i can not get my mind around the idea of a self - diagnosed disease .
i have absolutely no problem saying that i am an addict .
i have no problem with saying that alcohol <UNK> a destructive force in my life .
i have no problem saying that all of my problems with alcohol stem from me .
"i have huge problems with the concept of a "" higher power "" ."
"i have no higher power , or at least not that i can identify ."
i have been for many years a confirmed atheist .
"i do not believe in god , a god , spirit or what - have - you ."
during this era in time there is a <UNK> on the pop - culture from <#> 's to <#> 's .
the people of the earlier days enjoyed going to see silent films .
"they were men who could blow a horn or , play a guitar and , the voices were also an instrument of beauty ."
these individuals were telling about folk stories and <UNK> and just raising a little hell .
"the magazines and <UNK> replaced the old standards of being <UNK> , and savings ."
now was the time to own what you get now
simple new way of ownership is installment buying .
"we had great writers <UNK> <UNK> , and <UNK> lewis ."
the culture moved everyone into enjoying getting together with your <UNK> and friends to listen to new music .
"having fun and with no worries , of course their is always the games of <UNK> ."
"the movie stars were very interesting to everyone because we wanted to find people to look up to , and to encourage us ."
"we want interesting people to <UNK> or to make a hero out of that person putting more concern on their character than them just being "" joe <UNK> "" ."
"the <#> <UNK> and , the <#> little pigs , gone with the wind"
"i do not like war ; what is all this fighting for , i think you need to stand up and fight for justice ."
", there has been <UNK> killing , there has been <UNK> , <UNK> who do not support the american way ."
"these people are allowed in to destroy buildings with people in them , and bomb and kill in the name of god !"
i asked my pastor <#> time when mc <UNK> had blown up the government building with the people and the children inside
"how do we live through this kind of hate , crime , and loss of life ."
this is <#> of those moments when i want to share about women .
i was trying to run away from her because of her ability to be very critical .
she was very good at being objective about many of our problems because as working in a college all day she did n't want to hear anymore problems .
when she came home at the end of the day she wanted peace and quiet .
i liked fixing things and figuring how they worked .
so i <UNK> to <UNK> my mom because i was more of <UNK> boy then a girl .
she <UNK> me with her ability to keep a cool head in a <UNK> .
"she is a great cook and <UNK> , the best !"
so i love every thing she has taught me .
there 's still more so hopefully i will be able to share with you latter on .
i think a woman can be anything she chooses to be .
i think that the idea of a woman being a help - mate to my husband is a great job in itself .
"i do have other <UNK> such as , art and i love animals ."
she was also known for her ability to be a <UNK> .
i think she and i have a few things in common .
"she married when she was <UNK> old and her husband , will was <UNK> and i are have the same difference in age except we are ten years apart ."
<UNK> and will join together to write and express ideas about <UNK> husband and i are very interested also in art and history as it changes each moment .
i would like to learn to write and be a more mature writer
so i can communicate as my father told his stories .
i guess he turned this job over to me when he passed a way .
i think there should be labor unions in america today because the public really seems to need someone to listen to them . <#> .
"<#> . if you have been in prison , that person should not be <UNK> from a job just because he had a problem ."
"<#> . women have a hard time competing with men for a fair wage , and the sexual abuse is <UNK>"
", i do not like it when i am treat as a play thing instead of someone who could add a vital part to a team in business ."
"i would like to see everyone treated the same , but i realize that would require <UNK> ."
i grew up in a time when the people of a different skin color was very <UNK> even after the civil rights were fought and won !
"i was aware of "" <UNK> "" , here in <UNK> ."
today there are several programs that are run to help the poor and those living in poverty .
"if the young lady was still in school she would need to go to high school , or do the <UNK> ."
study program and make a plan for her life .
there is also child support paid by either parents .
this program actually will find <UNK> dad 's and mother 's too .
they can send this person to jail and <UNK> their <UNK> in tennessee .
the way tennessee <UNK> their program is very <UNK> .
i came from the state of missouri that rewards you for going to work ; instead <UNK> you for trying to better yourself tennessee
"they tell everyone who is not on families first <UNK> if you are less , then they are eager to put you on the program ."
if you do not better yourself after <#> years they can kick you their program .
"there are solutions , i keep looking for them ."
"so , alex and i were on our own that day ."
she woke me up that morning to tell me to get dressed because we were going to giant to pick out my birthday cake !
she picked out a very cute cake ( see below ) and of course i had to have a balloon as well !
she made my day very special and it is a birthday i 'll never forget .
urllink here is the balloon that alex picked out for me !
this is the biggest balloon i think i 've ever seen !
it has all the disney princess ' on it .
urllink alex picked out a very nice care bear cake for me !
she sang me happy birthday all by herself ( she would n't let me sing with her :-)
"as you can see she also picked out <UNK> cups and hats , and hello kitty plates !"
urllink this is the present and card that alex gave me for my birthday .
"we painted the tea set together , then put it in the oven to set ."
this was a lot of fun and a great idea !
( alex really did pick this out ! ) now i 'll always have a <UNK> of my <UNK> birthday .
urllink alex and i had a great time on my birthday .
"she made my day very , very special !"
"while my parents were here visiting us in va , we drove into washington dc to see the wwii memorial ."
it is a beautiful memorial and a fitting tribute to the men and women that served our country in wwii .
"after visiting the memorial we walked the length of the reflecting pond towards the capital building , walked through the korean memorial and took the tour bus around washington ."
we also had a great lunch at union station .
urllink the kids had a good time <UNK> their feet in the fountain that is part of the memorial .
"well , my last attempt at a blog was <UNK> - the software was very <UNK> and i lost my blog when i tried to <UNK> the software ."
so i 've found this ' blogger ' software and it is supposed to be really good - so i 'll try again !
both drew and kelly have a new - found interest in tennis .
for now they are having fun and learning all they can by playing with neighbors and friends .
drew 's baseball team the dragons won the championship !
drew had a great season at short stop and he became the de - <UNK> relief pitcher - very cool under pressure !
<UNK> ( our cat ) - now almost <#> yrs old - had some health issues and we thought we were going to lose him .
the vet thinks he has either early <UNK> failure or thought more probably had <UNK> .
he gets iv <UNK> every couple days with danielle 's help and is back to eating regular food again .
lets hope <UNK> is n't on his 9th !
"<UNK> , the newest member of our family is doing great ."

<#> out of <#> ' ai nt bad and i 'm not telling which <#> ....
"but in florida , some are singing ' hail to the thief ' ."
country song : after hundreds of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> : we are coming into <UNK> .
we want to know whether george w bush won the election or did brother <UNK> steal it for him ?
"18th floor division of elections , we have come to ask mr <UNK> roberts , the director , a few questions ."
we have a <UNK> that says we have to have a private company to do this .
"we put it out for bid , we put it out for bid , and i think i 'm done with this interview ."
<UNK> : let me just show you the contract if i could mr roberts .
it says here in the contract that the <UNK> is supposed to be done by <UNK> .
it could look to others do n't you think that you paid $ <#> <#> to purchase this election for the republican party .
"roberts , could you answer the question regarding the contract ..."
"state <UNK> : oh , man ! never a dull moment ."
<UNK> : i do n't know why he had to call the police .
we had n't gotten to our difficult questions yet !
after the elections did they use their powers to prevent the count of <#> votes for the democrats ?
the democrats say the answers to both questions are yes .
"<UNK> : in any other country in the world , if this had occurred , there probably would have been <UNK> or military troops throughout the streets ."
he won the popular vote and he won the vote in florida .
they should n't allow you to contest an election then give you no way to contest it .
<UNK> : <UNK> bush promised his brother he was going to deliver florida .
i believe the republicans strategy was at all costs we deliver florida .
<UNK> : were people taken out of polls and stopped from voting ?
this is the company that the state of florida hired to remove the names of people who committed serious crimes from the voter lists .
"i have obtained a document marked "" <UNK> and trade secret "" ."
it says the company was paid millions of dollars to make telephone calls to <UNK> they got the right names - but they did n't .
there is nothing in the state of florida files that says they made these telephone calls .
"so the question remains , why did the republican leaders of this state pay millions for a list that stopped thousands of innocent democrats from voting ?"
the first list from <UNK> included <#> names from texas <UNK> by george bush 's state officials .
"they said they were all <UNK> , serious criminals <UNK> from voting ."
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <#> of those removed from voter roles after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him a serious criminal .
: i have never spent a night in jail .
"i had a speeding ticket probably <#> - <#> years ago , i guess , but that 's about it ."
<UNK> : do you think you should be allowed to vote if you had a speeding ticket ?
the florida <UNK> likes to see young prisoners <UNK> in front of the capital in old <UNK> uniforms .
me and superman had a fight prisoners : me and superman had a fight prison guard : i hit him in the head with some <UNK> prisoners :
"i hit him in the head with some <UNK> <UNK> : more often than not in america , the prisoner 's colour is black ."
that 's why the <UNK> is <UNK> florida for <UNK> voters ' civil rights .
"<UNK> : altogether , it looks like this cost the democrats about <#> votes in florida , which george bush won by only <#> votes ."
the us civil rights commission is also on the trail .
<UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> and his colleagues will be in miami tomorrow to hear from voters <UNK> <UNK> .
there is a lot of public concern that the <UNK> selected is a firm that seems to have ties to the republican party .
<UNK> : they will be putting our evidence to database technologies .
"their vice - president told us that "" manual <UNK> by telephone calls "" does not mean ringing people up to check they have got the right person ."
so were they paid to produce a list which they knew would name thousands of innocent black people ?
so did they use their powers to prevent the count of <#> votes for the democrats ?
"in palm beach , america 's <UNK> nurse their <UNK> and their anger ."
<UNK> butterfly <UNK> caused thousands in this democrat town to accidentally mess up and they were refused replacement <UNK> promised them by state law .
"<UNK> : in all , palm beach voting machines <UNK> <#> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> bush 's secretary of state , <UNK> harris , stopped them counting these votes by hand ."
"she did the same to <UNK> , <#> of florida 's <UNK> , <UNK> and most democrat <UNK> , where machines failed to count <#> in <#> <UNK> ."
"this alone cost gore another <#> votes , in an election in which harris declared george bush winner by only <#> votes ."
in charge of florida 's vote count and co - chair of bush 's presidential campaign .
"<UNK> <UNK> represents palm beach , in the state <UNK> where she leads the democratic opposition ."
"she interpreted every rule , every law in a way to help george bush ."
<UNK> : we are driving down to miami to witness an american ritual .
"in britain , you count the votes , then announce the winner ."
"in florida they declare the winner first and here we are , still counting the votes ."
woman 's voice : she is showing the ballot in front of the light .
they can see the light through where the <UNK> have been punched through .
then she holds it in front because sometimes you can see things in different light .
"<UNK> : normally these are machine - read , right ?"
<UNK> : they are carefully going through the <#> <UNK> <UNK> that harris did not want <UNK> .
sources tell <UNK> that gore 's ahead by <#> votes .
democrats are upstairs eating with their <UNK> friends charging $ <#> a plate .
not far away from the <UNK> on the balcony a voter had taken <UNK> at gun point <UNK> against the election fraud .
but here it is back to champagne politics as usual .
<#> democrat whispered they would have done the same as <UNK> harris if they had the chance . but
"another , party chairman , bob <UNK> remains bitter about this ."
", florida democrats <UNK> bush , <UNK> harris , clay roberts did everything they could to stop every legitimate count of the vote ."
<UNK> : all fingers point to the <UNK> bush crew in <UNK> .
: state officials point the finger at the <UNK> and say it is their responsibility to check if the names on the list are real <UNK> before <UNK> them .
<UNK> roberts says his job is just to pass on the list .
"roberts now <UNK> he did n't bother to check with <UNK> , if innocent people were on it ."
<UNK> : off camera he said : we did not call and say did you check the list again ...
the whole <UNK> of this is like ok you screwed up you did n't check with <UNK> and if you want to hang this on me that 's fine .

"john kerry understands the ideals of community , faith , and sacrifice , because <UNK> defined his life ."
"again and again , we’ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available ."
his values and his record <UNK> what is best in us .
john kerry believes in an america where hard work is rewarded .
"so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas , <UNK> offer them to companies creating jobs here at home ."
john kerry believes in an america where all americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in washington have for themselves .
"john kerry believes in energy independence , so we aren’t held <UNK> to the profits of oil companies or the <UNK> of foreign oil fields ."
"john kerry believes that in a dangerous world , war must be an option , but it should never be the first option ."
"a while back , i met a young man named <UNK> at the <UNK> hall in east <UNK> , illinois ."
"he was a good - looking kid , <#> - <#> or <#> - <#> , clear eyed , with an easy smile ."
he told me he’d joined the marines and was heading to iraq the following week .
but then i asked myself : are we serving <UNK> as well as he was serving us ?
they must be <UNK> and they must be defeated .
and he knows it ’s not enough for just some of us to <UNK> .
"for alongside our famous <UNK> , there ’s another <UNK> in the american saga ."

"we worship an awesome god in the blue states , and we don’t like federal agents poking around our <UNK> in the red states ."

there are <UNK> who opposed the war in iraq and <UNK> who supported it .
"we are <#> people , all of us <UNK> allegiance to the stars and stripes , all of us defending the united states of america ."
"in the end , that ’s what this election is about ."
do we participate in a politics of <UNK> or a politics of hope ?

"i believe we can provide jobs to the <UNK> , homes to the homeless , and <UNK> young people in cities across america from violence and despair ."

a number of ladies have developed shin <UNK> over the past <#> weeks .
please let your mentor know if you are suffering from shin <UNK> and we will work with you to <UNK> them .
rest the <UNK> by pool running or <UNK> jogging for <#> - <#> days if you have access to a pool .
<UNK> jogging uses the same muscles as running and is an excellent way to <UNK> injuries and <UNK> while staying on track with training .
this will require a <UNK> belt available from most pool supply or sporting goods stores ( $ <#> or so ) .
just <UNK> jog in the deep end of the pool for the same length of time you are scheduled to run for .
icing is a wonderful natural way to reduce <UNK> .
this is best done when the injury is <UNK> .
take an over the counter anti - <UNK> medicine such as <UNK> or <UNK> for a couple of days .
soak in a warm bath with <UNK> <UNK> after icing .
the main thing is to rest the area by doing something other than running for <#> - <#> days .
when you resume running make sure you go easy .
stretch your <UNK> per the links below before and after running .
shin <UNK> updated <UNK> sooner or later almost all runners experience pain in the <UNK> or shin .
there are several types of <UNK> injuries that may develop in this region as a result of the repeated pounding from running .
"shin <UNK> , stress <UNK> , and chronic <UNK> syndrome have a common mechanism of development ."
understanding the circumstances that lead to these injuries is the key to preventing <UNK> overall <UNK> theme that leads to <UNK> running injuries is excess training with inadequate recovery .
excess and inadequate are relative terms and must be judged against <UNK> usual training routine .
the more that excess and inadequate <UNK> from the usual training routine the less time it takes for an <UNK> injury to develop .
each foot - strike <UNK> a <UNK> that travels up the leg .
this energy must be absorbed by the <UNK> system .
the harder the running surface the greater the <UNK> .
"soft grass , smooth dirt , <UNK> , and concrete represent , in order of increasing <UNK> , the usual spectrum of commonly encountered running <UNK> ."
they help absorb shock and <UNK> efficient energy ( motion ) transfer .
"matching the type of running shoe to the <UNK> specific <UNK> , and proper shoe fit are important ."
"similarly , worn out shoes should be replaced early because of reduced shock <UNK> capacity ."
both tend to develop shin <UNK> term shin <UNK> refers to a painful condition that <UNK> along the inside ( <UNK> edge ) of the shin ( <UNK> ) .
"the usual location is along the lower half of the <UNK> , anywhere from a few inches above the ankle to about half - way up the shin ."
"<UNK> , this represents a spectrum from mild to severe ."
the pain will often return after exercise or the following morning .
"as the injury <UNK> the athlete will experience more time with the pain , and less time without it ."
"eventually , if ignored and training continued , the pain may become quite sharp and may focus on a very small area of the bone ."
if this happens a stress <UNK> should be <UNK> treatment for shin <UNK> is rest .
depending upon <UNK> it is often necessary to completely stop running for a period of time .
generally this is done until day - to - day activities are pain free .
when running is <UNK> <UNK> and this is where many injured runners make a mistake <UNK> it must be significantly different from the routine that lead to the injury .
the concept of relative rest <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> between training as well as <UNK> the volume and intensity of training .
"<#> can often substitute cross - training activities ( e.g. , <UNK> ) for running to help increase the <UNK> between running days ."
however the most important <UNK> strategy is not to repeat the mistakes that lead to the injury .
"examine all the training <UNK> <UNK> surface , shoes , training volume , intensity , workout type , hills , weather conditions , etc ."
"this all takes time and effort , but it is well worth it ."

"every thought you think , every comment you make , every action you take , in some way will change things for you and your world ."
"you move through life , leaving consequences in your wake ."
and the quality of life is determined largely by the nature of those consequences .
and those small things can quickly add up .
that 's why your attitude and your outlook on life truly matter so much .
"because they have a powerful influence over what kind of difference you are making , in the big decisions and the small ones too ."

"well let 's see , i 've titled this life sucks so i should probably work with that <#> eh ?"
"can you tell i 'm from canada , eh ?"
"so anywho , i am frustrated with my life ."
yes i really do love my husband but he is insane .
he has to take insane pills to keep him sane which would be great if they actually were doing the job they are supposed to .
it 's like i am living with my <#> year old son twice .
"oh hell , there i go with the eh thing ?"
has it lost it 's touch i wonder ... ?
well let 's go on to the rest of my misery shall we ?
"i am not working , neither is my husband , we have no money and we live in a hell hole of an apt ."
the only way my life could get worse would be if i had to live on the street ..... not that i am complaining or anything ...
oh and did i mention that it is hot as fucking hell in this <UNK> city ?
"the humidity sucks , the sun sucks , the fact that there is no air <UNK> in this shit hole is another <UNK> of course ."
"oh sure we have a couple fans , but do they give us a good blow ?"
that did n't come out like it was supposed to did it ?
"oh ya , and lets not forget the insane fuckers we have to give our rent to ..."
"i think yes , oh hell yes , that they could ."
"have like a <#> ants crawling all over their place , in their food , on their body , in their <UNK> , on furniture ...."
"what would we do without all the <UNK> things , such as <UNK> , ants , spiders , did i forget anything ?"
and then of course there is the parking lot .
", they leak all the damned time when it rains , at least the kitchen window does ."
"and the <UNK> are falling apart , in need of repair , but instead they thought to tear them right off the fucking walls of the buildings ."
"no , they do n't even have the fucking windows put in properly ."
"yes , that 's right , backwards of all the stupidest things ."
the idiot <UNK> do n't even know how to put a damned window in correctly .
"i am sick of talking about where i live cause i think we can all say , it 's been covered !"
"just kidding , i could n't fit through my screen ..."
"ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ....."
"i've also made up some of my own quotes so i just might use those to start off my <UNK> , who knows ?"
actually i am a pretty down to earth type of gal ...
"i mean here i am , spilling my guts out , but does anyone care ?"
"of course not , they are too interested in their own lame excuses of their life ...."
"ha , ha , ha , ha .... got you again !"
"you know , i 'm beginning to think outside of the box .... whatever the hell that means ."
i 've just heard that expression before so i thought i would share .... <UNK>
"i know .... <#> % of the world is stupid which puts me right on in their with all of them , right ?"
"it 's kind of funny , i do n't usually swear "" much "" in my day to day routine , but ironically it feels really good !"
"lol ... holy shit , could i babble much more ...."
"just a minute , i 'm getting my next wave of words from my <UNK> - sized brain ....."
<UNK> trying to reach my head .... with many struggles ...
"uh oh , it 's about to ...... explode ! ! !"
"ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ....."
oh and guess what else i am going to post ?
"no , they are not actually his you <UNK> ...."
"they are just jokes he finds , but i have to tell you , they are so fucking hilarious !"
"however , be warned : some may contain adult situations , language , violence , death , <UNK> , insanity , who knows !"
no children should even attempt to read them or i will take their childhood ...
"please do keep in mind again however , that i am still getting used to this blogger thing ,"
i will be damned surprise if someone actually reads all this shit all the way to the bottom !
"as awesome as that would be of course , yet surprising none the less !"
all the more power to you .... ! !
"i think not ... must <UNK> , cause well you know .... i have to do the bed thing , but not the thing in the bed .... lol !"
"sleep has been calling to my <UNK> - sized brain , so must go ..... now ! !"
"rose ..... but before i go completely , must put <#> of my "" <UNK> geek <UNK> .... so here goes nothin !"
i ca n't seem to locate where i put the fucking things so i will have to <UNK> .... <UNK> ! !
i mean here i was looking everywhere but in the desk and below and behold there some were ! !
"so the ones that i found are not actually mine , but they are good anyway ."
"oh and they are kind of <UNK> , but what the hell , i 'm giving it to ya anyway ."
.... our sweetest songs are those that tell of the <UNK> thoughts ...
i know nothing about this except that i now have my own blog !
"i 'm probably going to talk about my life , but i must warn everyone , it is soooo not very exciting ."
"when i was first signing up for this , i tried to use a title that would relate but that did n't work ."
there is apparently a lot more people who have the same boring type of day to day life .
"i tend to babble on and on and on and on , in case you had n't noticed ... lol , but that 's just me !"
"i hope i do n't offend anyone , not my intention ."
"i am very blunt , so if anyone reads anything i write , please keep that in mind , thanks !"
"wow , i am at a loss for words ...."
"that does not come easily to me , anyone who knows me could tell you that ."
"i promise i will try not to <UNK> as much all at once the next time , kay ?"
"well , what i will probably do is make a day - to - day type of diary relating my activities , if i do n't get too shy ..."
"i get these <UNK> chest pains , they drive me crazy ."
"it is something to do with gas , you know , the <UNK> ...."
is that how you spell that ? who knows .
"gotta go for now , but i will be back ."
i just heard from <#> of my very best friends who moved away last summer .
she and her family are coming down to visit us for a couple weeks !
i can not tell you how excited i am about this and so is my son ! <UNK> ! ! !
urllink about me hi all my blogger buddies ..... if i had any ...
"actually , i have met a couple people who have read my blogs , which was very nice , thank you very much ."
", it 's just <#> of those <UNK> things so there is n't going to be a lot of stuff"
they will allow me to put on it although i did add a link to <#> other page i go to a lot .
"it is kind of that , but there is other things on it like poetry and stories and neat information that might be cool to read ."
"it 's no <UNK> if no <#> goes to it , it 's just somewhere i like to go every now and then ."
"well , i suppose i do n't have much more to say ."
"i have a job interview on wednesday , aug ."
that first few minutes at the interview is going to be the <UNK> for me i think .
i have n't even had an interview for over a year .
"i just hope i do n't screw it up <UNK> , cause i am at a very desperate state right now ."
"i mean i need , need and need a job and asap ! !"
i guess when people have this it does n't just go away .
"but anyway , do n't want to babble on about that anymore , it is just way too depressing to have to talk about ."
"<#> , well first of all i would just like to thank those of you who commented on my blog ."
"so if you want me to continue feeling special , please do continue to comment or whatever , thank you !"
now to get on with the rest of my exciting day .... but not so much really .
"oh well , at least i will get a lot of shit done that needs to be done , right ?"
"finally , i got my <UNK> and first aid <UNK> ....."
"i was quite excited about that , because i have wanted to take the training for a very long time ."
"i guess i just could n't be bothered before , but anyway , i am now finishing this on aug ."
...... i was sooooo tired last night it was n't even funny !
so i think i passed out like right away .
they just live at the other end of town too .
their mother is <#> of my very best friends as well so i told her that we would come to see her on the weekend .
those kids of her 's are absolutely wonderful .
i just love them as if they were my own .
"they are very well <UNK> and they are only <#> , <#> and <#> years old ."
"i think my husband may have posted this when it was n't even finished , but luckily i can go and edit these things ."
i 'm still not sure how to make my posts not look so <UNK> .
so guess what i had a dream about ?
"so i did n't actually see them "" doing "" it ,"
"now i do n't know if they were supposed to be his , but i do n't think so ."
well once i got to the bed i just laid into both the <UNK> little bitch and him too .
i told him i wanted a divorce ..... in the dream you fools .... lol .
"but you should have heard me bitch , bitch , bitch and then bitch again ."
"well that 's about it for now , so i will <UNK> back at ya in a bit , or not , who the hell knows ...."
so i finally broke down and sent an email to the blogger support people .
now hopefully i explained myself clearly enough for them to give me some kind of help .
watch with my luck it will turn out that you have to pay for that luxury ....
"yep , that would be my luck alright .... seems to go along with the territory with me almost all the time !"
"ya right , who am i kidding , it is all the time with me ....."
"so anyway , did i happen to mention that i smoke ?"
"wow , this is amazing , here i am writing not only <#> but <#> entries .... in the same day !"
"if someone out their does n't have it , i would suggest they download it because it is great to have !"
"it seems that my cousin , tracy , just realized what a cool tool it is to play around with ."
the address is just simply urllink <UNK> if anyone is interested .
"it takes like <#> minutes to download , depending on the speed of your internet connection or download speed , whichever ."
i 'm going to assume the reason it took tracy so long to find it is because she is just too busy to play on the computer .
"she is a real estate agent after all so she is always on the go , you know ?"
i think i will give her my blogspot url so she can read all about my boring life ...
"but anyway , i think i have <UNK> enough for tonight ..... so i 'm running away now ...."
"if by some miracle anyone does read any of my posts , i would love a response or comment or anything actually ...."
"i really am running away now , but you know i will be back .... again and again and again .... lol !"
", i will just have to keep this blog thing up to date ."
"so , i can not stress enough how boring a day this has been !"
"i mean , i 'm about ready to go insane in this <UNK> little apt ."
"you see , the friends that he used to play with has now moved"
so he has been quite bored and driving his father and i a little nuts .
"i mean , the child wo n't even go outside and it 's been very nice outside ."
i can not tell you how anxious we are for school to start again in sept .
it 's hard to do anything with him or take him places when there is no damned money to do it with .
luckily he is going over to his friends new place tomorrow for the night .
we are looking forward to that let me tell ya !
"his friends still live here in london , they 've just moved to different ends of it , that 's all ."
"but anyway , that 's enough <UNK> about that topic for now ."
"you know , i really wish we could move from here , to a <UNK> again , like we were in before this place ."
it 's so damned shitty that we had to move from <#> form of a house to an apt .
if life does n't get any better soon i think i might lose my mind totally . not working or having money sure does make life crappy to live .
"it 's hard enough just to make ends meet as it is , with the little amount of money we have coming in ."
and you know what is the worst part of all this ?
he is the <#> who is suffering the most .
"his life was turned right upside down when his dad was diagnosed with some form of depression , with all the problems and situations that just keep popping up ."
it is really hard and no <#> could ever really understand what i am going through .
i was not <UNK> on sounding so depressing on here ...
this blog thing might just turn out alright .
especially if i can just <UNK> to the air with no <#> to tell me to keep it all to myself .
"i am still fairly new at this thing , so i am "" technically "" just getting used to all the different things i can do with it ."
i have nothing or something to say i can still babble on and on and on ca n't i ?
"it 's okay , i 'm open to any and all kinds of criticism"
"well , i think i 've just about run out of things to say ."
"my husband and i are going to look for <UNK> . or something tomorrow , after we drop off our son to his friends house ."
"if we could move from this hell hole asap that would be great , but of course the key word is "" if "" is n't it ?"
hopefully it will set me straight sort of speak ....
"i think i was meant to be rich , but i 'm just not sure how it is supposed to happen ."
well it 's just that i seem to want everything
"and i have expensive taste in stuff , although i still am cheap , to a certain point ."
"of course when i say i want everything , that only means like the regular stuff ."
"it just does n't seem fair , but then again , who ever said life was fair , right ?"
"aww well , maybe i will have a better day tomorrow , who knows ?"
"i might come back and sound a lot more positive ..... but for now , i think i 'm outta here ..."
i thought i would share with everyone my stupidity .... lol below you will find <#> emails i sent to david <UNK> ( angel from the show angel ) .
"they are pathetic so i thought i would give everyone a good laugh ... sure , way to go pam , make yourself look even more ridiculous ....."
"do n't worry , i am not so naive to think that these will actually be read by him ,"
"hell no , i just found this silly website ..."
<UNK> ...... if anyone would like to read any of the really stupid stuff .
"beleive me , as ridiculous as what i wrote is , you would be completely <UNK> by what other people have written !"
i am not denying that i am a fan because i am .
"i 'm just not an insane <#> , that 's all ."
"come on ladies and even some men , there is no denying how incredibly sexy that man is ...."
i mean he is <#> very very attractive man .
"i mean really , have you seen the guy 's body ?"
"hot , hot , hot and then hot ! and"
"you could drown in them , over and over again ."
"okay , i better stop <UNK> or else people are going to stop believing my non - <UNK> crap ... lol !"
"oh , by the way , if anyone knows how to put some links on my blogger , i would appreciate any information on how to do it ..."
"gotta go for now , but i 'll be back ...... unfortunately .... ha , ha , ha ."
"p ..... aka , rose subject : me being pathetic ..."
"<UNK> , i absolutely know that this is a pretty pathetic thing to do , especially for a grown woman , but"
"it is however , <UNK> where i am from , in canada ."
i must confess i do enjoy watching you on angel and well basically everything else .
"your very pleasing to a woman 's eye , no matter what age ."
"i did a commercial for an australian <UNK> a while back and i did a <UNK> <UNK> in an adult magazine , though not the popular ones ."
i 'm not sure why i just said that ....
"it 's probably not even any "" real "" addresses ."
"if you do get this message by some strange coincidence , i should mention that you can read more about me on my blogger site ."
"the address is : <UNK> , if you are interested ."
i suppose i really do sound a bit pathetic here do n't i ?
"well i do n't mean to talk about me so much , sorry ."
"it has n't come out yet , at least not in canada , but when it does , i 'll be getting it !"
"well i must go now , so take care and good luck in the future !"
lol ! that is the whole point to this is n't it ?
i really do not expect you to answer or even read this
"but i just wanted to tell you or whoever what i think of you and your talent , so thanks for reading , whoever you are !"
pam l subject : here i go again .
"<UNK> , it is just pam again , being a pain in the a * * once more .... lol ."
i heard the funniest story about how you landed the part of angel on buffy ....
"apparently you were walking your dog and someone just "" happend "" upon you , because of your tall , dark and handsome looks ."
it 's about time someone noticed your talent is n't it ?
"i just wish i had of remembered your first television appearance , on married with children ."
"i know you obviously would have had to work very hard to get where you are today , but i still think it was great how you were noticed ..."
"so if anyone has any ideas i would love to hear them , thanks !"
our family had the best time yesterday afternoon .
matthew made it back from his mission trip to st .
he said he had a great time and met lots of friends and has already been on line to add them to his messenger .
"also , we had our minnesota friends stop by on their way home from florida and got to feed them ."
it 's so neat how the lord allows for paths to cross sometimes .
"can it get much better to be in kentucky and have chicken , fried <UNK> , green beans and homemade chocolate ice cream ?"
<UNK> not on earth but it can when we get to heaven .
we have slept a couple of extra hours and getting breakfast ready .
we only have to do what we want to do today .
"matthew is already off to go play "" <UNK> "" with his friends for a birthday party ."
he has been looking <UNK> to this for <#> weeks .
"the wait poem by russell <UNK> desperately , <UNK> , <UNK> , i cried ; quietly , patiently , <UNK> , god replied ."
"i <UNK> and i <UNK> for a clue to my fate ... and the master so gently <UNK> . """
""" lord , i need answers , i need to know why !"
""" is your hand <UNK> ? or have you not heard ? by faith i have asked , and i 'm claiming your word ."
my future and all to which i relate hangs in the balance and you tell me to wait ?
""" i 'm needing a ' yes ' , a go - ahead sign ."
"or even a ' no , ' to which i 'll <UNK> ."
"you promised , dear lord , that if we believe , we need but to ask , and we shall receive ."
"lord , i 've been asking , and this is my cry : i 'm weary of asking !"
"then quietly , softly , i learned of my fate as my master replied again , "" wait . """
"so i <UNK> in my chair , defeated and <UNK> , and <UNK> to god , "" so , i 'm waiting ... for what ? """
"he seemed then to <UNK> , and his eyes met with mine ..."
"and he <UNK> said , "" i could give you a sign ."
i could shake the heavens and <UNK> the sun .
i could raise the dead and cause mountains to run .
i could give all you seek and pleased you would be .
"you 'd have what you want , but you would n't know me ."
you 'd not know the depth of my love for each saint .
you 'd not know the power that i give to the faint .
you 'd not learn to see through clouds of despair ; you 'd not learn to trust just by knowing i 'm there .
you 'd not know the joy of resting in me when darkness and silence are all you can see .
you 'd never experience the <UNK> of love when the peace of my spirit <UNK> like a dove .
"you would know that i give , and i save , for a start , but you 'd not know the depth of the beat of my heart ."
"the glow of my comfort late into the night , the faith that i give when you walk without sight ."
the depth that 's beyond getting just what you ask from an infinite god who makes what you have last .
"you 'd never know should your pain quickly <UNK> , what it means that my grace is sufficient for thee ."
"yes , your dearest dreams overnight would come true ,"
"but oh , the loss if i lost what i 'm doing in you ."
"so , be silent , my child , and in time you will see that the greatest of gifts is to truly know me ."
"and though <UNK> my answers seem terribly late , my most precious answer of all is still "" wait "" ."
i have to tell you all about this strange dream that i had this past weekend .
i dreamt that that texas <UNK> <UNK> family was in bay city and trying to <UNK> up my family .
"i know that it sounds funny here , but i 'm telling you i was so scared to get out of bed ."
chris was at work and it was just me and the <#> dogs at home .
do you think it 's the <UNK> messing with me ?
my husband ate the rest of my left over steak .
i looked over everything and still could n't find .
i was as angry and disappointed to see a plate in the sink that had left over <UNK> on it from my steak .
i just ate my salad and <UNK> for lunch .
"he just looked at me and was trying not to smile and said , "" i do n't know who took your steak "" ."
"well , he finally admitted that he took it , but did n't realize that i wanted to have it ."
the next time he said that he will ask me if i want it .
i almost fell down the stairs when i looked out the window and saw the snow on the roof and on the ground .
"only <UNK> and today was suppose to get to <UNK> , but it is currently <UNK> and rainy ."
when will spring finally be here in michigan ?
i ca n't not stop thinking about being pregnant .
"i know that it 's too early to even think that i am , but every little <UNK> or <UNK> in my stomach makes me think that i am ."
i think alot of it has to do with this cycle being a <UNK> and a <UNK> cycle .
this is the first cycle for both with me and my <UNK> .
since the <UNK> he has been so happy and talking about a baby more then ever before .
"he was great at the <UNK> and wanted to make sure that if there is another <#> , that he will be there , again ."
"at this <UNK> , once the doctor had the <UNK> <UNK> , she asked my <UNK> if he wanted to push the <UNK> on the <UNK> ."
"he just smiled and said , "" sure "" ."
later on that night he could n't stop talking about it .
"sometimes you just need the escape , sometimes you just really really do n't want to think too much ."
"with the hype surrounding i , robot i tried really hard not to put too much into it ."
i saw this movie with open mind and i actually liked it very well .
but the <UNK> in me had some complaints and while these <#> factors can go together .... they did n't this time .
"so , in short : total battle between <#> <UNK> .... the result can not be anything but an enjoyable "" middle "" !"
performances in a movie like this do n't have to be good .
the action and the visual effects is what we 're seeing here .
"however , i found some sense - no sense in the script and again ... <#> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"maybe if i 'll see it again , i 'll like it more or less ... but time will tell ."
"will smith is will smith , all others are okay but the robots are great ."
"of course you 'll always be able to tell ... """
hey ... this is so fake ... this is not real .
""" well , in that case i say : come on ! ! !"
but ... look at the <UNK> <UNK> ... highly enjoyable but realistic ? ?
"i , robot is a great fun and good in visual effects ."
it 's difficult to talk about this movie a lot more .
i did n't read the stories and i 've heard it 's <UNK> little <UNK> to <UNK> 's book ... only the title .
so ... i can not judge how that material is handled .
i guess i have to watch it again ... all in all ... total struggle between <UNK> .
my opinion feels like a child from <UNK> parents !
* * * out of * * * * * stars .
i posted on craig 's list yesterday that i am looking for a summer <UNK> partner .
"those were n't the words , but that was the message ."
"i tried to be honest and let men know that i am not precisely "" <UNK> "" , though i 'm pretty close these days ."
"since i did n't post under "" casual encounters "" , i only received <#> responses ( so far ) ."
"if i were that heavy , <UNK> speaking , they 'd be running the other way ."
"amazing what men think is acceptable in their own <UNK> , but totally <UNK> in women ."
another man is someone who has responded in the past and whom i 've actually met and had sex with .
"if i wanted a man with a severe ed problem , i would have stayed married ."
not to mention the fact that the guy was dumb as a fence post .
and he had a thing for women with large butts .
"even when i 'm at my <UNK> , i have what <#> man once called an "" amazing ass "" ."
"another simply said he was looking for a "" taller gal "" for a summer romance and wanted to know if that would be me ."
"well , he did n't tell me how tall he was , so how would i know ?"
"finally , i have a photo of a very attractive , <UNK> man in my inbox ."
makes me wonder when and why he had it taken .
"i never knew her when she was a child ... we lived in different states , widely <UNK> , and never attended family <UNK> ."
"i "" met "" her about <#> years ago when i contacted her mother in search of <UNK> information ."
"her mother was so excited about my <UNK> the family that she told everyone , and my cousin contacted me by email ."
"those were the early days of email , when i was excited about every piece of mail i received , especially if it had some personal significance ."
"these days , my cousin 's email would have been dumped directly into the spam bucket , unless i <UNK> it ."
but back then it hit my inbox -- and i was fascinated .
"my cousin knew the whole family history . or proclaimed to know , anyway ."
"it was also the picture of <UNK> , but that did not at first concern me ."
"over the years , my cousin and i have gotten to know each other pretty well ."
she has introduced me to numerous family members and worked hard to make me feel welcome and comfortable .
she 's visited me and i have visited her .
"we 've tried hard to establish a <UNK> , with a lot of success , but also with a lot of regret -- on my part ."
"the thing is , my cousin drives me insane ."
"okay , sometimes she 's not talking , but at those moments she is <UNK> ."
"the lunch gave her a stomach ache , the wine <UNK> a headache , the cat <UNK> her <UNK> , the plants her <UNK> ."
"and if it is n't her body , it 's her kids ."
"child number <#> has become <UNK> of a particular drug , but is still getting good grades ."
the <UNK> goes on and on and on .
"i had my cousin here from friday until monday afternoon , and i was <UNK> about weapons of individual destruction within hours of her arrival ."
"urllink the trash <UNK> , urllink the mobile <UNK> and urllink my little war ."
the last <#> tend more to be largely fictional in style but they suit the topics they were written for .
as with everything else at <UNK> take them with a pinch of salt .
above writing all in a mad rush this morning i have uploaded some more photographs .
these are of taiwan and of singapore and can be found in the usual urllink photograph section where all photographs are usually located .
"urllink <UNK> articles and stories i actually <UNK> an article this morning , something that i have not done for a while ."
i got up at the <UNK> early hour of <#> am so maybe that was it !
"anyway , strangely enough this article is <UNK> ' writing ' and it is called urllink the brain drain ."
i am still awaiting my marching orders to go back to sea !
terrible time the <UNK> of life but they are more than made up for by the returns or the arrival back home .
"the sadness and the happiness in life , the <UNK> and the <UNK> ."
"and there is alot to say for the expression "" absence makes the heart grow <UNK> "" , i know from experience that this is true ."
"well , i might just go and write another article or have an afternoon nap - seeing as how i got up so early ."
"urllink <UNK> : travel articles , marine writings and cultural diversity i received this email from an upset <UNK> this <UNK> .... .... ...."
"dear mr <UNK> , in what section of our links would you like to be ?"
"in the meanwhile , could i make a few <UNK> ?"
"first , when you write to someone else asking for a link , it would be nice if you already had the ' <UNK> ' link in place :)"
"wow , that is me certainly been told to go and stand in the corner with a <UNK> cap on !"
"i feel small , enough to fit through the eye of a needle - except , in contrast to that specific email , i did receive <#> nice ones ."
<UNK> ones so my website can not be that bad !
his email had me so worried and upset last night that i did not go to bed .
"anyway , that is not all that is bad with the world ."
"poor guys , but is there any hope for them ?"
a <#> week <UNK> course on how to stop <UNK> ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"oh well , better go and write some useful article for my website ."
<#> week to go before i am due back to sea ....
.... <UNK> silence will reign over the website for another <#> months at least !
for more stories and articles visit urllink <UNK> now

i have a humorous section and a marine <UNK> .
big companies get around this by paying lots of money .... ....
"so , from this relatively stable place , i think it 's time for me to publish my current weight ."
"<#> <UNK> , or <#> stone <#> , or <#> pounds ."
so what is the plan that i 'm currently following ?
"i have to say what time it was , precisely what i ate , where i was when i ate it , and any additional comments ."
"i put a <UNK> around <UNK> of foods that i consider to be a meal , and an <UNK> by anything i ate that i consider to be excessive ."
"if i <UNK> , i 'm still supposed to eat the meals i 'd planned ."
"i 'm not supposed to judge myself at this stage , but merely to keep accurate and <UNK> records ."
"i keep a separate sheet for every day , so that i can see both what i planned to eat and what i actually ate ."
<#> more thing i 'm supposed to do on this plan is to weigh myself once a week .
"this might be difficult , since i threw away my bathroom scales over <#> years ago now ."
but i can see the sense in weighing myself more regularly .
it 's time to face up to the numbers on the dial .
"not to scare myself or punish myself , but to know the truth and put myself in a better position to deal with it ."
a friend of mine who reads this blog from time to time suggested a while ago that i should post my weight here on an ongoing basis .
"i did n't want to do it at the time , but now i think it 's a good idea ."
"so if i have n't posted a weight update for more than a <UNK> , please feel free to give me a <UNK> ."
"bigger or smaller , i 'll keep you posted ."
"<#> . when you feel hungry and it is n't time to eat , cleaning your teeth is a good alternative ."
"<#> . when what you really want is chocolate , a <UNK> 's friend is no substitute ."
the plan i’ve decided to follow applies more readily to <UNK> of a normal weight than to <UNK> <UNK> with a weight problem .
"it can be difficult for overweight people , because it ’s all about <UNK> the diet and giving up any <UNK> of particular foods ."
"the theory is that <UNK> and food <UNK> are <#> of the major strategies that trigger <UNK> eating , and thus they need to be <UNK> for good ."
"but the <UNK> of other overweight <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> , i am not a doctor , and other <UNK> <UNK> ."
"this is my blog , and i am speaking personally ."
my anonymous <UNK> has suggested ( in a response to my previous entry ) that people are more likely to keep <UNK> to other people because of the consequences .
"i can’t comment on how true that might be for others , but"
"most people are a good deal more forgiving than i am , for example ."
"for me , i think it 's much more likely to be an issue of self - worth than of consequences ."
that ’s <#> of the reasons why i’m working on the self - worth thing .
"i’m also working on the forgiveness thing . and as for whether i’m working on the weight loss thing , i’ve had an important <UNK> this week ."
"on tuesday i was due to be <UNK> my partner to london for something important , but i was too sick to go ."
"i’d eaten something on monday night that had <UNK> with me , and had to spend the whole of tuesday within <UNK> distance of a bathroom ."
"i was really pissed off that i had to miss the occasion , and i was also pissed off about spending the whole day with gut ache ."
"i heard my pain . and then , when i’d finished complaining to myself , i asked myself what i wanted ."
and i waited until i was able to give me an answer .
"while waiting for my answer here , in the <UNK> of this narrative , i’ll talk about a book i’ve been reading over the last few weeks ."
"it ’s called <UNK> <UNK> eating , by doctor christopher <UNK> , and it ’s about <UNK> eating disorder ."
it was lent to me by <#> of my <UNK> when i told her that i saw my eating as a form of self - harm .
"neither of us really thought i had <UNK> eating disorder , but she thought i might like the book anyway ."
"that ’s right : in case anybody still doubts it , there is now an impressive body of research showing that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eating ."
"i used to diet in my teens and early twenties , when i was a little bit overweight but a long way from <UNK> ."
what i unfortunately did not do at that time was learn to eat sensible food in sensible portion sizes at regular <UNK> .
"there has been very little research into the issue of <UNK> eating in the <UNK> population , so the book was <UNK> more towards <UNK> ."
"although i have never been <UNK> ( or <UNK> ) , i <UNK> through reading <UNK> ’s book that –"
in addition to all of my other issues around food –
i still do have problems with <UNK> eating .
"the food <UNK> sheet suggested in the book was of precisely the same design as the <#> originally given to me by my <UNK> , which <UNK> my curiosity ."
"but that was about all , until tuesday evening , and my answer to the question that i asked myself here <#> paragraphs ago ."
"so , what was it that i told myself i wanted ?"
i asked myself to follow the <UNK> - inspired plan to deal with my <UNK> eating problems . and
( to my anonymous <UNK> : this is an example of a commitment to myself that i have every intention of keeping . )
<#> of our conversations led me to <UNK> something important about commitment .
i realised that i’m very good at <UNK> my <UNK> with other people .
i’m also pretty good at making sure that others honour their <UNK> with me .
"but when it comes to the <UNK> i make to myself , i don’t seem to be anywhere near as <UNK> ."
"more specifically , i’m wondering if i make <UNK> to myself that i have no intention of keeping , or if i do intend to keep them but don’t"
i suspect that i’ve been guilty on both counts .
i will treat myself with the same amount of respect and <UNK> as i treat others .
"i will forgive myself for <UNK> , just as i would with anyone else , but – again , just as with anyone else –"
i won’t allow myself to treat me like shit .
"i hope you get angry , and wake up every morning with a fire in your fat belly , ready to head to the gym and shed the wait ."
i also know that <UNK> are shitty places : everyone looking at everyone <UNK> don’t let that stop you .
you could have a lot of years ahead of you ( if the fat doesn’t kill you ) .
take <#> or <#> years to loose the wait and you’ll still be young enough to party hard for a decade or
"<UNK> ” he wishes me anger on a daily basis , but i’d prefer to resolve my problems with love and understanding ."
i believe there is too much anger in this world .
"i want to love my fat away , not fight it away ."
i want to thank it for the ways in which it has helped me up to now .
"i want to understand the messages it has for me , so that i can deal with them in different ways ."
"i want to honour my excess weight and send it away with <UNK> and affection , not just <UNK> it like some <UNK> <UNK> ."
"my fat has served me well , and i’m grateful for that , even though i no longer require its services ."
"i believe that i now have the strength to live a <UNK> life , but that wasn’t always the case ."
"my fat has protected me from other demons , and i thank it for that ."
"i now believe i’m strong enough to face those demons on my own , and i invite them to come and test me ."
"my gym is not , for the most part , a shitty place ."
"people of all ages and sizes exercise there , and staring is rarely a problem ."
"it ’s the kind of place where everyone has their own fitness agenda , and that ’s what they get on with ."
"i dislike it when it gets overly crowded , smelly and noisy , but for the most part i go at the <UNK> times ."
"i believe i have a lot of years left in me , and i would like to live them as comfortably and <UNK> as i can ."
"it isn’t death i fear , but an <UNK> life ."
a good friend of mine who read my blog a couple of days back advised me not to take too much notice of what anonymous people say .
"if by this he means that i shouldn’t let it worry me , i’d like to assure him that it doesn’t ."
"but if he means that i should ignore anonymous responses , i don’t ( necessarily ) agree with him ."
i think my anonymous <UNK> has given me a great gift .
"he or she has spoken freely , without fear of being named and <UNK> , some of the thoughts that <UNK> swim about in many a head out there ."
"it ’s a privilege to have those words in front of me , where i can both experience their impact and <UNK> their content ."
i probably encouraged some of those words by not flying off the handle in response to his or her initial comment .
had i either ignored the original comment or responded in anger or <UNK> i doubt whether i would have been so fortunate .
<UNK> to negative conclusions can <UNK> potentially <UNK> <UNK> .
"i will never know what most of them think , but it is good to have an example of at least <#> of those <UNK> ."
i may need to develop a stronger sense of self - esteem as a fat person before i’ll be completely willing to release my excess weight .
"i 'm hoping that my creation of this blog , and my interaction with its readers , will help me to do that ."
my anonymous <UNK> also said : “ <UNK> is a relative thing .
you put <#> next to the other and the <UNK> model might even look “ <UNK> <UNK> still be attractive .
"fat <UNK> , who wants to look at a fat , hairy tub of <UNK> ?"
"” fat is a relative term , as my <UNK> notes at the beginning of this paragraph , but forgets by the end ."
"how fat does <#> have to be in order to qualify as a “ fat , hairy tub of <UNK> ” , for example ?"
so let ’s take the term “ hot ” ( which i take to mean “ <UNK> ” as opposed to “ overly warm ” ) .
is that not also a relative term – or at least a subjective term ?
"i’ve seen larger <UNK> people of both <UNK> whom i can think of as <UNK> , and likewise with smaller <UNK> people ."
is this not a case of beauty being in the eye of the <UNK> ?
"but perhaps my <UNK> is talking <UNK> as opposed to <UNK> , in which case i <UNK> his or her point ."
"however , if you remove the sting and <UNK> the question as “ who wants to look at a fat <UNK> ever ?"
"” , and count me as a fat person , you 'd get a very different answer ."
i could ( but won’t ) give you a list of names .
"worry , i’m not going to go there today ."
"everyone ’s got a weakness , a <UNK> , an <UNK> people are looked down upon because of such things ."
i think it would be very hard to process all the information that <UNK> us on a daily basis without <UNK> to <UNK> and personal <UNK> .
": it ’s very likely that fat people are looked down upon , in most societies , in general . and yet – and yet –"
"i , with my <UNK> and intelligence and <UNK> , can do great work here ."
"i , with my huge belly and my huge brain , can <UNK> the <UNK> ."
"i , single - <UNK> , can show them the <UNK> of their ways ...."
"surely a decision to leave all that behind implies a sense of <UNK> , perhaps even of <UNK> ...."
does the success of my own quest for health and fitness lie in the resolution of this dilemma ?
especially if your so fat that you want to loose half of your body weight .
"and , from what i’ve read so far on your blog , i don’t pity you for the situation you’re in . """
"which is great , because pity is not a response that i 'm seeking at all ."
self - pity may be <#> of the reasons why i developed this weight problem in the first place .
"never mind , have a second helping of your favourite pudding ."
<UNK> someone is like feeding them after they’re already full .
"if anyone reading this does pity me , i 'd like to invite you to go beyond your pity and examine what lies underneath ."
"perhaps you feel superior to me , in that you do n't have a weight problem yourself , and never have done ."
"maybe you feel <UNK> of me , because i must lack moral <UNK> ( or whatever ) to end up weighing twice as much as i would like ."
"or possibly you feel a <UNK> of understanding , a <UNK> of "" had circumstances been different , that could have been me "" . and"
"it is there , in that recognition , that i wish to meet you ."
my rational side does n't yet know why any of this weight is necessary .
"watching , and waiting , and looking for clues . and participating in this blog . and hoping ."
"his or her response began : "" an insult just seemed fitting ."
people who know me well may be able to identify me –
"i have mentioned my first name , and rainbow fury is not a new <UNK> –"
but i have not <UNK> the existence of this blog very widely .
"i am writing here on a single issue , and do n't intend concentration to become a general blog about what 's going on in my life ."
the only people i have <UNK> told about its existence so far are those whom i know to be supportive .
"i expect to tell more people about it as time goes on , including those whom i have experienced as less supportive ."
i also know that other people may come across it by other means than my own word of mouth .
"having said all that , i find it hard to understand how an insult can seem like a fitting response ."
"i can certainly appreciate the existence of a reaction , and i 'm pleased to have <UNK> a series of responses that i can engage with ."
"more than anything , i appreciate the fact that this person and i are now having an open dialogue ."
is it only the existence of <UNK> <UNK> that allows fat people to be <UNK> ?
"if such <UNK> were to be <UNK> overnight , would the larger <UNK> amongst us be <UNK> <UNK> ?"
my <UNK> is that the answer would be no .
i think it is the very existence of <UNK> <UNK> that allows <UNK> to be <UNK> .
"<UNK> which , in <UNK> america , held that black people were <UNK> to whites ; or , in <UNK> germany , that jews were <UNK> to <UNK> ."
even today we can see many forms of <UNK> that are <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> .
it is that very <UNK> which plants the seeds of perceived <UNK> in the <UNK> 's mind .
"if there were any way in which <UNK> <UNK> could convey the former without the latter , i would be in favour of them . as it is"
"so i publish <UNK> on the internet , and i welcome anonymous responses ."
i embrace the existence of a society in which all the usual <UNK> are set aside .
"i believe this place can foster exploration and growth , precisely because of the lack of those controls ."
my anonymous <UNK> has sent me a <UNK> banquet of comments – far too much food for thought for me to manage in a single sitting .
"the whole meal can be found in the comments to my entry "" a reader writes "" ."
i will select bite - sized <UNK> to chew over during the week ahead .
"thank you , whoever you are , wherever you are ."
it was great to spend a couple of hours with my friend again and catch up on old times .
"<#> chunk of our conversation <UNK> out at me , and i want to make a note of it here , so that i do n't forget ."
she and i have got into this pattern where neither of us calls the other very often .
"every time we talk we 're on the phone for a couple of hours , give or take , and both of us are very busy people ."
"it 's hard to set aside a chunk of time like that , and neither of us wants to cut the other <#> short ."
"and then i made a connection with eating , which is the bit that i do n't want to forget ."
"<UNK> are wonderful things , but it 's much smarter to have smaller , regular meals more frequently ."
"my friend got the analogy in an instant , and i think we 'll be talking to each other a bit more often now ."
we 'll be saving things for later rather than trying to <UNK> everything into <#> extended <UNK> .
just like i hope i learn to do with food .
"i noticed that my friend - super fit , and not <UNK> large to start with - had lost weight since the last time i 'd seen her ."
today i met <#> of my former <UNK> for the first time in <#> months .
she was the person who first introduced me to the gym .
( here ’s where i want a <UNK> <UNK> font to indicate the clock winding back a year .
you’ll just have to imagine that bit . )
she told me she was going to check out a new gym the next day .
"when i asked if i could come along too , she almost fell off her chair ."
"but along i went , and i was <UNK> to find that the place looked really nice and didn’t smell of sweat and <UNK> ."
"her enthusiasm was <UNK> ; she assured me <UNK> show me how all the scary machines worked , and i signed up on the spot ."
"for the next <#> months we went to the gym quite a lot – sometimes together , more often at different times ."
i signed up for yoga and tai chi classes .
i carried on going to the gym pretty frequently for another <#> months .
i was away for a week and lost touch with my routine .
the next time i went back i lost my mobile phone .
i <UNK> up the courage to go back again in january .
have you ever been to a gym in january ?
"<UNK> with the <UNK> , sweating bodies of people who all seem to have resolved to melt away their excess <UNK> in record time ."
between then and now i’ve been to the gym about <#> times a month . that <UNK> with <#> to <#> times a week last summer and autumn .
it 's time to start going back there more often .
"but here i sit , typing my story into a computer instead ."
in july <#> i promised myself that i would lose half of my then <UNK> over the next <#> years .
"despite some initial <UNK> , in june <#> my weight reached a higher point than ever before ."
"there 's something going on here , and i do n't know what it is ."
i intend this blog to be the verbal equivalent of shining a bright light into all the <UNK> and <UNK> that stand between me and my goal .
"i am ready to examine and release whatever is blocking my path , and i 'm ready to have a good time along the way ."
"i still want to say them somewhere , though . here"
i’m still thinking about whether i want to embrace the term <UNK> . and i’m still thinking that my answer is no .
"<UNK> tends to be an insulting term directed towards a fat person , whereas fat can be a purely <UNK> term ."
of course it ’s possible for fat to be used as an insult –
it ’s possible to use practically any word as an insult – but
i don’t see how <UNK> can be used as anything else .
"that , for me , is where the <UNK> lies ."
an anonymous comment arrived in my e - mail this morning .
"it asked : do you only want to <UNK> "" fat "" ? or do you also want to <UNK> "" <UNK> "" ."
"my immediate response is that i 'm not very fond of "" <UNK> "" : i felt insulted when i first read that e - mail ."
"this could have been because of its <UNK> , its <UNK> and <UNK> , the word "" <UNK> "" ; all <#> , or none of the above ."
"i 'd really like to know what <UNK> my "" feel insulted "" button , but i do n't ."
"i can generate a <UNK> <UNK> from my head , though i know those do n't help ."
"as i re - read the e - mail a couple of times , i began to feel a lot more comfortable ."
"any perceived intent on the part of the <UNK> was being generated by me , not by the person on the other end of the <UNK> ."
when i was first in therapy i would not allow my therapist to refer to my weight .
i <UNK> when he dared to suggest that i might be a little bit on the large side .
who i am is more important than what i look like .
but maybe a couple of years back i started to melt a little .
"yes , we can talk about my weight now ."
"but don’t call me overweight – that would <UNK> some judgement or criticism of my current weight , some need to be something other than i am ."
"call me something <UNK> , something non - <UNK> ."
"the gay community <UNK> "" queer "" ; why ca n't we larger <UNK> people <UNK> "" fat "" as a positive <UNK> term ?"
"even as i pursue my goal of a <UNK> body and a <UNK> lifestyle , i still want to identify as fat ."
and yet i wonder if there 's something in this very wish for <UNK> that is preventing me from losing the weight i want to lose .
and there 's the rub . because i are <#>
", i do n't seem to be able to be not <#> as well ."
i want to find a comfortable solution to this <UNK> .
"my name is pam , and i am overweight ."
on a bright and sunny morning in the back woods of michigan i woke to the sound of singing birds in the trees .
as i laid there contemplating the day i wondered what made me choose to return to this hole in the wall town .
"i knew the answer , if i wanted to be honest ."
it was a combination of boredom and love of my mother .
"what else would you call a small town with nothing to do , nothing to offer and no hope of change ever ."
"california , on the other hand , seemed like heaven ."
"fun , exciting and very far away from michigan ."
"after <#> years in heaven , however , i figured out what got to me was staying in any place for too long ."
<#> years had been too long for california .
in an effort to change my surroundings i took a few quick classes in french and signed up with an agency that placed american <UNK> with families in france .
"after going through the telephone interview process with many families , i was hired by a family in <UNK> and scheduled to arrive at their home in october ."
those arrangements in place i quickly packed my things and headed back to michigan to spend the <#> months prior to october with my mother .
"now here i was , waking up in what i use to view as hell , <UNK> , michigan ."
<UNK> was once a <UNK> summer vacation spot for black families .
"money had left <UNK> many years prior and from the <UNK> and <UNK> up properties throughout , it didn’t look like it would be coming back anytime soon ."
"when i was a small child living in <UNK> , ohio we came to <UNK> frequently to vacation ."
we stayed in a cottage that my father had helped build as a child with his <UNK> .
"i don’t remember hating the experience , and actually believe my brother and i enjoyed it ."
"hot summers in <UNK> included playing outside , driving into “ town ” to buy ice <UNK> at jones and having our parent ’s <UNK> attention ."
it was a place that we visited .
"they didn’t even have a big grocery store , let alone a mall !"
"i was also pretty sure they didn’t have a high school , but that thought didn’t seem to cause me as much <UNK> as no mall ."
"<#> months later i found out that while i was right about there being no mall , i was wrong about everything else ."
"all things considered , the <#> years i spent as a teenager living in <UNK> were not that bad ."
"this small fact lead to bigger problems like teen pregnancy and high drug use , but"
i managed to avoid those <UNK> and left for california as soon as my parents said i could .
"now here i was , back at square <#> , if only temporarily , to hang out with my mother ."
my mother lives on <#> of the many lakes in the county .
of the <#> houses that surround the lake my mother ’s is the only <#> that is occupied year round .
the other neighbors only visit for a portion of the summer .
"right now , towards the end of september , we are all alone ."
"me , my mom , honey , our golden lab , and the <UNK> ."
"it ’s very quiet , with the exception of the birds singing in the trees , and quite <UNK> ."
at moments like this i wonder why i had been so quick to <UNK> <#> years prior .
the last day i would spend with my mom before heading to detroit to begin my journey to france .
my mom took the day off from work so that we could spend some quality time together .
"quality time with my mom can be as simple as being in the same room , same house , or general <UNK> ."
my mom has an <UNK> about her that can be felt miles from her physical being .
its an amazing thing but <#> that i am quite dependent on –
her <UNK> seemed to reach out to me while i was in california keeping me from feeling so far away .
in march of <#> i was admitted to the emergency room of <UNK> park hospital because i was very ill .
"i couldn’t catch my breath , i didn’t respond to my husband , i didn’t respond to anyone ."
by the following morning i had been up all night being worked on by doctors .
i had a <UNK> put into my heart so that they could draw blood directly from the point since my veins were <UNK> in such a <UNK> state .
"i was better , breathing and talking , in a knowing state of where i was and what was going on , even though still very weak ."
around <UNK> that morning a <UNK> came into my room to draw blood .
he was sent from the lab because they needed blood from my veins and the nurse ’s
were unable to do it in such a <UNK> state .
"the <UNK> entered the room , advised me why he was there and then tied rubber <UNK> around my arm ."
at this point i shut my eyes in an effort to rest while this was being done .
"i had been up all night , was exhausted and sick of all the <UNK> that had been constantly around me ."
once the needle was <UNK> the <UNK> put his hand on my left breast and <UNK> me .
being completely honest my first thought was that this must be a way in which to get the blood flowing so that they could withdraw the blood required .
"i knew they had been having a problem , and it was all that seemed to make sense ."
he removed his hand and then placed it again on my left breast again <UNK> .
again i thought it must be a medical routine .
"he answered her and she left the room again and again , he placed his hand on my left breast ."
at this point i began to believe that something was not right with this situation
so i opened my eyes and looked up at him .
"he was not looking at me , but was looking into the hallway as if to watch and be sure that no <#> could see what he was doing ."
"he then removed his hand from my breast , took the needle out and left my room telling me that he hoped i felt better ."
"immediately after this encounter i was taken to have an <UNK> , then my husband and children came to visit"
and then i was allowed to try and get some rest .
i <UNK> the nurse to come in and when she did i told her that the <UNK> had felt me up .
"that i had thought it must be some way to get blood <UNK> , but on reflection i was sure he had felt me up ."
she reported my complaint to the powers that be and the <UNK> began .
when my husband visited me the next morning i informed him of the event and he immediately went to talk to whoever was in charge .
the hospital immediately took the position that i was a nut and this did not happen .
they were extremely defensive about the whole thing and without blatantly saying the words called me a liar .
when i got out of the hospital i was required to be off work for a month .
a week after i was released from the hospital i felt better and left my house for the first time .
i went to the police department and filed charges for sexual assault .
the police called to inform me that they were <UNK> the case because now there were <#> unrelated women <UNK> the same person of doing the same thing .
in september me and the other victim <UNK> before a grand jury which <UNK> the <UNK> on <#> counts of sexual assault .
in may of <#> the trial was to begin against him .
the first thing to happen was that the <#> cases were <UNK> .
apparently it ’s the courts <UNK> to bend over backwards and help the <UNK> in any way it can .
as it played out the other victim ’s case went first – the <#> with a witness – and ultimately the jury found the bastard not guilty .
i feel duty bound to at least try and get him convicted .
chances are even <UNK> in my situation that he will be convicted but i feel like i have to try .
there are many things in my favor that were not in hers .
"she was <#> , and i am <#> ."
i have been married to the same man for <#> years and come across as a very stable and <UNK> individual .
"not only was she <#> , but she also spoke to the press about the incident a lot ."
she created a circus atmosphere by talking to the paper and the tv stations frequently .
the defense attorney in her case flat out said she was lying and simply in this for the money –
i don’t know if you can be prepared .
and this was all <UNK> him because of <#> – again whatever .
"the man is a <UNK> <UNK> on innocent , very ill women in a state where they can not help themselves and he needs to stop ."
i’m just so pissed off at the injustice and the <UNK> of the court system .
i don’t know why this surprises me though .
"was found not guilty , michael jackson will surely be found not guilty and scott <UNK> is destined for the same fate ."
"my daughter , <#> , just came in , sweaty from the <UNK> bike ride home . """
( referring to her address <#> months out of <#> . )
just last week we were riding ancient <UNK> over the manhattan bridge into <UNK> .
"he was a small man who enjoyed american western life , maybe it was minnesota"
"so that 's not western , let 's just say <UNK> life ."
"it all makes sense if you 've ever been to a northern england town , the <UNK> can be <UNK> ."
life can be <UNK> to football and the pub .
i found the official website and was reading it to her when i clicked on john <UNK> .
i started to read and saw the word dead .
"i could n't believe it , he was dead , died in his sleep ."
"in my mind he was young , with a <UNK> curly mass of red hair , a little odd looking , but a great guitarist , everyone knew that ."
"joe <UNK> was gone , and now so was john <UNK> ."
"all of this means that age has caught up , it 's nothing new , exactly what generations before realized when their <UNK> members started to die ."
"dear readers , i am truly thankful to google for this opportunity to share some of my most precious values ."
i also encourage people with different sets of values to create blogs of their own .
"i will not praise or criticize the <UNK> , partly because they may change too often ."
"still , somebody has to claim responsibility for the inevitable mistakes <UNK> ."
"as will be <UNK> below , this religion is not based on any revelation , and none of the <UNK> stated here is claimed to be <UNK> from ‘"
"therefore , i feel an obligation to start with some facts about the author ."
"i , <UNK> , am a moral agent , a political <UNK> , a scientist , and an artist <UNK> other things ."
"especially since my teenage years , religious matters had been central to how i understand and guide myself ."
"my parents , all my relatives , and practically every adult i knew as a child were muslims <UNK> a wide range of <UNK> ."
i was given what i now consider to be a <UNK> shallow education in islam .
"i <UNK> islam with more <UNK> and passion than some adults in my environment , and made some modest efforts to <UNK> myself ."
"nevertheless , even for a few years ( as a teenager ) when i defined myself as an ‘"
"islamic <UNK> , i had not read the <UNK> in my native tongue ( <UNK> ) ."
"fell <UNK> of islam in early <#> , right around when i turned <#> ."
"for a while , i was a genuine <UNK> , maintaining a belief in a single , <UNK> creator , a creator whose ‘"
<UNK> had not been <UNK> by any theology that i was aware of .
"my change of faith from islam to <UNK> was very <UNK> , based on a good deal of thinking , but in the end quite <UNK> ."
this change had been the most important change in my life up to that point .
"later , and i do not know exactly how much later ( a year or longer ? ) , i became an <UNK> ."
i felt that the only way that i could maintain a faith in a ‘
"<UNK> , my <UNK> of the idea of a perfect creator must have been the most important change in my religious views ."
"but , somehow , the change from <UNK> to <UNK> was far less <UNK> and far less <UNK> ."
"in late <#> , probably around late october or early november , i laid the <UNK> of my political philosophy , which <UNK> to me my greatest mission ."
the book will end with different suggestions to the <UNK> audience and future generations who may struggle with the same questions .
"i still intend to complete that book , which i once thought of <UNK>"
i believe that this book will be <#> of the best things that i can leave to future generations .
"for many years , though , i was concerned about the timing of the book , and even about my being open about my religious views ."
"i fully intend to be a leader ( hopefully , just <#> of the many leaders ) of a global political movement ."
"that movement will have a good many obstacles and enemies , <UNK> to its many radical <UNK> ."
"i was afraid that i could do some <UNK> to that movement , if i also sought to establish a religious community ."
"as years progressed , however , i became convinced that i have an obligation to make clear my religious views <UNK> what may ."
the doctrine that i will outline here may or may not appear to some readers to be a ‘
"<UNK> i , for <#> , would not be offended by those who refuse to grant our faith that title ."
<#> brief ( and inadequate ) answer to the question of “ who is a <UNK> ( a believer in <UNK> ) ?
"” is this : “ a <UNK> is someone who is dedicated , above and beyond his/her own interest , to doing good deeds , spreading good , and ‘"
"theology , i.e. <UNK> about whether or not a creator exists , and oo ’s nature , is not central to <UNK> ."
"” put differently , faith in different <UNK> is to be treated with <UNK> by <UNK> ."
we do not consider the question of whether or not a creator exists to be an ‘ <UNK> <UNK> ( who knows ?
nor do we argue that the answer should be positive or negative .
some of us may find it necessary to be searching for an answer to this question .
"all the same , it is our <UNK> about good and evil that <UNK> and <UNK> us ."
<#> reason why such an answer can only be <UNK> inadequate is that ‘
"<UNK> can be , and indeed is interpreted in many different ways by different people ."
we fully accept the <UNK> of this diversity of perception and interpretation .
"we also understand that many acts intended to create , maintain , and spread goodness may result in ‘ <UNK> , or downright ‘"
"whether or not believers in other religions take ours as a religion , they must understand a few things that are unique about us ."
"we accept no authority , no doctrine , and no <UNK> that goes against ( direct or <UNK> ) human interests ."
"we acknowledge the <UNK> of conflict between human interests , and even between human beings and other species ."
we understand that well - <UNK> people ( as well as ill - <UNK> people ) can make mistakes .
"<UNK> of our religious leaders , and seek to reduce <UNK> harm ."
"we also believe that we can , if we so choose , learn from our mistakes and the mistakes of others ."
we even question the need for full - time leadership positions .
we consider it our moral obligation to remain open to ideas that can guide us in greater service to goodness .
"therefore , we believe that we must clear all obstacles to good ideas , wherever they may come from ."
"if we end up having leaders , their superior roles must involve rights and responsibilities of implementation , and not of decision - making ."
"never <UNK> to borrow ideas from all sources , including from our opponents and <UNK> critics , we strive to base our decisions on science ."
"<UNK> , and the like are also to be avoided as <UNK> <UNK> ."
") <#> . connected to our faith in <UNK> , we also believe in the possibility of progress in many ( and not all ) <UNK> of human activity ."
we recognize that mistakes may sometimes lead to learning and progress .
"while we accept that great mistakes can be great teachers , we try to make sure that our mistakes remain small ."
"we especially seek not to cause <UNK> damage to our environment , and not to <UNK> the future of our planet ."
"aware of our weaknesses , we <UNK> <UNK> as <#> of our central missions ."
"<UNK> , and as new <UNK> arise , our priorities are bound to change ."
"in <UNK> our priorities , we seek to <UNK> with believers and <UNK> who share our scientific approach to understand and/or to solve problems ."
"at present , we declare nuclear weapons and nuclear technology to be our first targets ."
we understand the nuclear threat as an <UNK> last stage of a continuing <UNK> of threat in the <UNK> between organized human societies .
"it is <UNK> that a similar , perhaps even worse , form of <UNK> could exist between societies other than ‘"
"all the same , people of our faith <UNK> nation - states as criminal organizations , and reject the idea of ‘"
"<UNK> , as well as any other <UNK> social <UNK> ."
"<UNK> are expected to declare their opposition to human <UNK> , to <UNK> and <UNK> nation - states , and to refuse to serve their ends ."
we do not accept that states or powerful religious communities have a right to force their understanding of ‘
<UNK> on their <UNK> members ( citizens ) and neighbors .
"we intend to show them the need to apply scientific <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> to matters of <UNK> law ."
"where we believe that a state , etc . , <UNK> innocent people , we consider it our moral obligation to protect the innocent ."
<#> . in <UNK> with our <UNK> moral stance
", we believe that human beings should try to <UNK> for their own crimes and mistakes ."
"those <UNK> who believe in an after - world , and/or divine justice are also <UNK> to make sure that they are prepared to <UNK> fully in this world ."
<UNK> ; but we do not expect to be <UNK> by the majority of <UNK> .
"<UNK> religions , we believe that no racial , ethnic , social , etc ."
group of human beings is to be banned from joining us .
but we also believe that our religion can appeal only to a tiny minority of people .
"unlike other religions , we do not even entertain the hope that all <UNK> will , <#> day , embrace our faith ."
we believe that ours is a religion for people who have the courage to accept enormous responsibilities towards <UNK> and to the <UNK> and the <UNK> .
"certainly , there are many <UNK> and self - <UNK> people who are members of different <UNK> , and there are many who will remain <UNK> ."
<UNK> are expected to respect and <UNK> with them .
"as effective as this early <UNK> is , we declare a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> children ( anybody ’s children ) in our faith ."
we remain committed to understanding more about what <UNK> ‘
"<UNK> , and we hope to <UNK> with scientists of all <UNK> in our search for a deeper and more reliable understanding of these ."
"we advocate changes in the ways we live , for the purpose of <UNK> our burden on our different <UNK> ."
we recognize that the present global human population is not <UNK> at any level of technology .
"therefore , we refuse to have children , or to approve of the <UNK> of other human beings ."
"our opposition to human <UNK> is intended to be temporary , until the global human population is reduced to a <UNK> level ."
"we make clear that we neither condemn nor <UNK> sexual conduct between humans ( be them heterosexual or homosexual , or any other conduct between <UNK> adult humans ) ."
"rather than being good or bad in themselves , we understand human sexual relations to have the potential to bring about both good and bad consequences ."
we acknowledge that goodness did not start with us .
the religions that are dominant today show a heavy <UNK> bias ; we feel that they are less than kind to the legacy of our <UNK> <UNK> .
we appreciate much of what <UNK> and settled human societies accomplished .
"we accept <UNK> in our social , political , and our scientific <UNK> ."
we still believe that progress is possible in unlimited fields .
"however , we believe that no political , religious , scientific , or other body has the right to impose a ‘"
forced <UNK> on the unwilling towards what the former may perceive as progress .
the principle that we propose for all <UNK> is this : progress should be fully ‘
<UNK> by those who hope to benefit from it .
<UNK> or scientific endeavor should be forced to pay full <UNK> for the harm they cause .
"where the harm is too great for the above to <UNK> for , the entire community of those who ‘"
"where progress brings more benefit than harm , the scientists , <UNK> , et ."
"al . , should also be given the right to ‘"
"some <UNK> will hopefully be qualified to bring <UNK> progress to <UNK> , as well as their own communities ."
"some may demand , and will hopefully receive , reward for their work ; some may choose to donate their <UNK> and <UNK> to their communities or to <UNK> ."
"hopefully , most <UNK> will work towards the creation of full <UNK> of ‘"
"nor do we believe that this world will soon be destroyed , and/or that human existence on this planet will be brought to an end by a divine power ."
"while we can not prove the <UNK> of either <UNK> or <UNK> visions , we consider it a ‘"
it is <UNK> that some other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> life on this planet long before the solar <UNK> .
"we <UNK> with believers and <UNK> for social , political , and economic programs that aim to improve human lives ."
"<#> project , and political vision , that may or may not join all <UNK> is the <UNK> of <UNK> , chronic human poverty on earth ( <UNK> ) ."
"we do acknowledge the right of adults to choose poverty , and the fact that some adults , through their bad choices , earn their poverty ."
"but we consider it criminal to <UNK> the poverty of children , entire families , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> of people ."
we should remain <UNK> against ‘ <UNK> efforts that are ‘
<UNK> ; but we should also <UNK> progressive efforts that appear to be promising .
"since <UNK> are <UNK> , for the <UNK> future , to remain a tiny minority , and to the extent that ‘"
i declare myself a poor student of <UNK> religions .
"therefore , i am in no position to state that <UNK> is the only religion for which all of the above statements can hold true ."
"then again , it matters little if the above are new or old ."
"i can only say that i did not learn them from anybody ( to repeat , nor can i claim to have received them from a ‘"
a list of over <#> items related to <UNK> can be found in a file named “
<UNK> ” on the same <UNK> where you may have found this file ( it is in <UNK> <#> format ) .
that file lists some of the main topics that <UNK> <UNK> to address in an <UNK> list .
"that file , too , is a work in progress ."
"well , well , took me awhile but i 'm always forgetting something that i wanted to do ."
"but hey , it 's coming out of my head so it 's my boredom to ."
"his women crap on him , the law hates him ( for what i have no idea ."
it 's not like he 's a real <UNK> or anything
it 's just that these cops are <UNK> . )
", and he just ca n't seem to have much luck ."
if it <UNK> for bad luck then we <UNK> have any luck .
first the van went back in the shop but luckily it did nt cost as much this time : ) .
then we went to the <UNK> and some <UNK> kid was in the car next to us so we moved .
"i know , <UNK> seem that bad but if you knew me then it is ."
"i do n't like crowds or alot of people , that 's why i mostly stay home to avoid people or crowds ."
though i do get cabin fever now and then and have to get out but not often .
well not really much else going on in this dead end town .
we have a family reunion to go to in the morning after church and it will be ok as long as my sister in law does nt show up .

i need to get some letters written before bed so i 'd better say bye ' for now .
"<UNK> 's out to my buds , <UNK> & <UNK> even though <UNK> is <UNK> at the moment ."
i 'm not good at putting my thoughts or whatever on paper and then letting other folks read them
but hey i figured what the heck i 'll give it the once around .
"any how , i 'd like to just say that its nice knowing everybody and i would like to tell you about my sweet hubby jason ."
we met when i worked at shell <#> years ago and have been together ever since .
not even his family has been able to seperate us and they have tried <#> way or another but they would swear that they did n't try .
i ca nt stand people who say they will do something and then do n't or say they will help you and then do n't .
i hate helping someone do something but then when i need help or something they all of a sudden have something else to do or they got go somewhere .
well i ca nt say what i want to cause it 'd ai nt really nice but i can tone it down some and say bump them ! !
any time i do something for someone any more and its going to cost them .
"i am native american and i have a very hard head , i 'm stubborn and will argue with you in a heartbeat if i know i 'm right or"
when i 'm mad or upset its best to just back off and leave me
i 'm trying to be <UNK> and keep it somewhat nice but also get my point across .
well i think that 's enough for now ill catch you all on the flip .
<UNK> go out to my buds robert and mike .
hey rob this could be good therapy for me when i need to vent .
shuttle driver -- of course ... after dinner with mr .
"dinner and <UNK> poo 's oh for the love of <#> 's ,"
"hey there , tonight has been interesting ...."
dinner and <UNK> poo 's wants to go to breakfast on sunday -- he has made arrangements .
i decided to bless him with my presence -- and attend ---- we are meeting another couple there .
<UNK> ride stopped by and i will have dinner with him saturday and sunday eve .......
"sounds like i will get my fill this weekend . later for now ,"
"so i say this , what the heck am i supposed to be doing here ?"
"not all that exciting or challenging , but i 've been working to have some other stuff to do ."
"maybe if i can squeeze it in , some college courses or other training ."
"something that is n't that likely to be taken away , like everything else ."
those damn <UNK> 's have done gone and took my baby again !
"please try to get away <UNK> those nasty <UNK> brains and leave me another post , <UNK> ."
this time do n't let those <UNK> <UNK> near my little garbage can .
i see those nasty <UNK> 's at least taught you something .
i want to get a good look at you .
just follow the trail of <UNK> bones i 've left for you in the forest - but do n't tell the <UNK> 's ! you
and i both know what greedy little <UNK> - asses they are .
"i think i look alot like a golden <UNK> ! """
"' ugh , ugh , <UNK> <UNK> a huge sigh and realized why she had chosen <UNK> as her name . '"
they are almost always just out of reach -- dreams .
"if only . ' she thought , over and over ."
"she had applied to so many places - in her partners name , since he has the ticket - the process of applying became a job in itself ."
a kind of <UNK> job with seemingly no purpose as no company had really bitten .
""" oh , of course , "" she <UNK> at her <UNK> down golden <UNK> that looked a lot like a <UNK> ."
she knew her partner would never go for it .
they were basically offering half of what they would make on the gorgeous island .
"she had <UNK> the island all day , ignoring the money thing , hoping they would come up with a better offer . '"
"geez , the marina had mountains behind , an ocean in front and <UNK> ! '"
all day she dreamt of the all that it would be . '
"a <UNK> "" she 'd always loved <UNK> . '"
"diving , <UNK> ' though she likely was n't brave enough ."
"but mainly , she <UNK> stop dreaming about having that vast , mysterious , changing , beautiful blue ocean stretched out in front of her every wonderful day ."
her partner had been up north at a temporary job
found this site and figured it would be a good way to keep in touch with the real world while i 'm stuck in the northern bush .
"whenever i can , i 'll be here to give you all a taste of the remote camp life ."
"i 'm sure it will sound a lot like a soap opera since camp <UNK> all become <UNK> in each others lives , being stuck together for so long ."
"however , any <UNK> to actual people living or seemingly dead is purely <UNK> ."
from here on in this is a work of fiction .
pick a bush - any bush ( by fort nowhere ) and that 's where this takes place .
"wink , wink :) the next time you see me i wo n't be here - i 'll be there ."
did i hear an irritating voice from my past that sounds alot like my ma ?
i could n't hear you over the constant <UNK> and <UNK> coming from my never ending coffee pot .
"of course , the cowboy songs in the background do n't help ."
so the blog on the road did n't work as well as expected .
"<#> , <UNK> was n't as planned on the road ."
"<#> , blogging a road trip is sort of like taking photos ; you 're either in the picture enjoying it , or standing outside taking photos ."
the most memorable place we visited was the urllink great sand <UNK> nation <UNK> .
"my photos are urllink here , urllink here , and urllink here ."
the <UNK> of sand <UNK> the size of mountains with snow <UNK> <UNK> in the background is definitely drug for the spirit .
"visiting urllink south carolina was great to see family and friends , but the <UNK> heat was something i have long forgotten how to get used to ."
"a funky artist community , with <#> rocking bar , was definitely <#> of the "" i 'll visit again "" places on our road tour ."
it was also nice to visit my friend rob and his new family .
<UNK> and i decided madrid and the sand <UNK> are both worth a return trip .
some memorable moments from the road : - <UNK> ken and lynn miller in st cloud .
i worked with both of these great people at <UNK> .
the next day the kids say they saw him on tv .
"( it was "" joe dirt "" ) ."
"max : "" whatever . "" - our side road trip with rob and family to that "" tent rock "" place ."
( too lazy to look it up ) .
"<#> of my favorite lines from the <UNK> <UNK> is "" action should <UNK> in wisdom "" , and i feel i learned something very special on this trip ."
"when i left my hometown it was with the thought that i would return <UNK> , with the <UNK> of my travels ."
i realize that the fortune i found is the woman i married and the children i 'm blessed with .
the triumph is finding the best place to live in the us .
"portland and seattle are both <UNK> , and i ca n't imagine willingly moving from the paradise of the <UNK> ."
"thomas <UNK> says you ca n't go home , just as <UNK> states you can never step in the same river twice ."
"well , <UNK> was n't as good as planned , so i did n't get to blog too much of the trip ."
saturday was <UNK> : kids : what state are we in ?
"anyway , we made it to <UNK> on saturday , and will stay until thursday morning and then head out for new mexico ."
"eastern washington can get old fast , and the curves though idaho and western montana can wear on you ."
we <UNK> off of <#> and took <UNK> to get to <UNK> .
"<UNK> is <UNK> between snow topped mountains to the east , rolling hills to the west , is on the <UNK> of <UNK> lake ."
"it really is a <UNK> and <UNK> little tourist town . since it only takes a day to get here , <UNK> and i"
are planning to <UNK> when we have more time to explore .
"i took pictures and was going to upload some , but realized i forgot the cable that <UNK> my camera to usb ."
"right now i 'm leaning on making our next stop <UNK> , but who knows ..."
so my <#> year old son max has an ongoing war of <UNK> with my <UNK> .
he has some interesting things planned so i had to take him to urllink <UNK> <UNK> for supplies .
"then i come back , put on the <UNK> and the urllink "" space <UNK> "" ( "" like , dude , that is sooo cool ! "" ) ."
"then i decide to <UNK> the first stop to urllink <UNK> , mt , since the <UNK> there has <UNK> ."
the next day is still up in the air .
cloud and we have to be there by sunday at a decent hour .
or i can still take <UNK> to <UNK> ( <#> hours ) and then <UNK> to st cloud is only <#> .
plus we 'd get to go through urllink <UNK> .
guess we 'll decide the second leg on <UNK> morning in <UNK> ...
i wanted to set up a blog to <UNK> my biggest <UNK> ( and latest <UNK> into it ) ; cross country driving .
we 've done it <#> times and ready for more .
"the trip back will have to be <UNK> as we go , because we 'll plan it on the road ."
"so the first thing you need is is a nice driving machine , complete with on the road <UNK> ."
"no , not an <UNK> , an urllink <UNK> ."
"throw in <#> kids , a dog , my urllink traveling companion , and we 're all set ."
"<#> bucks a night at <UNK> , and a few meals at <UNK> along the way , and our biggest expense will be gas ."
we drive about <#> miles or <#> hours a day ( whichever comes first ) .
yeah i guess i <UNK> just hate how it sounds
"<UNK> ya do it , she said , <UNK> you let that trash get a hold of your cock , get stoned on my <UNK> ?"
"<UNK> ya do it she said , <UNK> you let her suck your cock ?"
"oh , do me a favour , do n't put me in the dock ."

"remember just before the <#> election , when conservative <UNK> said that clinton was going to declare martial law and stay president ?"
"at the age of <#> , i was barely making it financially ."
"yes i owned a small place , but i earned a low salary that barely helped me get to the end of the month ."
once a month or every <#> months my mom bought me stuff at the groceries .
"i was lucky because i used a uniform at work , which the hotel cleaned for me , and they provided <#> meal a day ."
"food was not the best , but there was a slight selection ."
i am getting off subject of what i wanted to write .
"i lost weight , smoked , and dated a loser ."
"i did not want to meet any guy , after my recent break - up , but things happen for a reason ."
"i thought i would never see him again , so i had fun for intense <#> days ."
"as it turns out we continued talking on the phone , and i received weekly letters ."
"if e - mail would have been accessible , we would have <UNK> even more ."
"after <#> months , <UNK> <UNK> , decided to sell some things and come to the us ."
i thought what if he is the <#> ?
and also i had many things that helped me make up my mind easily .
my mom was getting on my nerves calling me <#> times a day asking me for advice she never followed .
my brother 's life style was messed up .
"he is gay and was involved in <UNK> , abusive relationships ."
"i did have lots of friends that were excited about my romance , so they were pushing me to do it ."
"at <#> point i remember saying : if everything works out , i quit smoking !"
there were <#> reasons to consider staying in <UNK> : my grandparents and my recent <UNK> to my dad .
"i was born , and gave me <UNK> , moral and love guidance ."
"my mom never expressed affection to me , but specially my grandpa showed me love every second ."
"i lived <#> blocks from their place as a kid , and i would rather be with them than with my school friends ."
"he arrived to <UNK> with nothing , and worked <UNK> until he no longer could n't ."
he had these amazing stories that i could hear for hours .
i played cards with my grandparents and had a blast .
"if they were <#> of the reasons to stay , it all changed in the month of july <#> ."
my mom had spent all the money he had sweat for .
"i told him i was a woman , and i could provide for myself ."
"i told him not to worry about me , because i was a fighter and i was independent ."
"that night i went out , it was hot , and i mixed alcoholic <UNK> ."
"my mother or brother were gone , so i was the <#> in charge ."
"that was not <UNK> , since i 've always been the mature of the <#> of us ."
"my life stopped , it was as if a <UNK> cut open my heart ."
"a few days later , after the funeral and all , i talked to my mom ."
"she was feeling guilty for having spent all his money , and thought that it caused his death ."
"i felt peace for having had that conversation with him the day prior to his death , but my hero had died ."
"my grandma got sick , and died on july <UNK> , just <#> weeks later ."
"they 've been together <#> years , so it 's not surprising ."
"after my grandparents were gone , my reasons to stay grew even smaller ."
"i thought that by trying to make it in another country , i would be repeating my grandpa 's story ."
the <#> force remaining for me to stay was my recent connection with my dad .
"after many trials and failures to have a relationship with him , i called him and we met for coffee ."
i do n't remember exactly if i called or he did .
i was amazed by what he told me .
"as a young girl , i was convinced that he did n't want me in his life and he did n't love me ."
"my mom always guilt tripped me , and i believed everything she said ."
"i was not a girl anymore , and my strong instinct told me that he was sincere ."
"i started a close connection , only to discover how similar we are even though i grew up without him ."
"the bad qualities and the good ones , jealousy , <UNK> , <UNK> , humor , strength , happiness , <UNK> , <UNK> , you name it ."
after a long time i understood why i was so different from mom and <UNK> .
"many years earlier i wrote him a poem wishing for him to love me , and there it was ... he cared !"
"still , i decided to come to the us ."
"i figured if he loved me , he 'll continue to do so ."
after <#> years he 's the main reason for me wanting to go back .
"wow , i thought it would be easier to start by traveling through my life , starting from the beginning ."
"i was born in <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> almost <#> years ago ."
my mom and dad were together up until i was <#> years of age .
"i have a younger brother with whom i have periods of silence and resentment , and others not bad ."
"when my parents divorced , i was told that i was really angry for not seeing my dad for over <#> months ."
"apparently , after i saw him i came back with <UNK> ."
"being <UNK> has always bother me a lot , until finally last summer i had surgery , and i am much better now ."
"my mom re - married <UNK> , a <UNK> musician and <UNK> ."
he was very creative and nice at the beginning .
"during the <#> years my mom was married to him , she made me feel very guilty about seeing my dad maybe once or twice a year ."
"<UNK> overtime became violent , and started to physically abuse my mother and i in particular ."
i do n't remember anything happening to <UNK> .
"i remember trying to fall asleep at night and hearing him hitting my mom , and her <UNK> for help ."
"i also remember a couple times in the middle of the night , getting us together and telling us we were leaving the house ."
"he never worked , and my mom did n't either at that time ."
<UNK> were living of my grandpa 's tremendous effort .
he arrived to <UNK> from germany with nothing and built his own little empire .
<UNK> went through a face that he was following the <UNK> diet .
i had to go to school after lunch and <UNK> like an alcoholic ... after <#> years my mom finally divorced .
i start a new paragraph because my life completely changed between the time i was eleven until pretty much i was <#> .
my mom had depression and sometimes spent days <UNK> by her bed with a bucket on her side .
"another thing that happened is that she became very <UNK> , and slept with almost a different man every night ."
when i was <#> she told me to smoke pot that it was not <UNK> . as a way of rebellion
"as i became older every time i went out and came back , i would see a jacket hanging on the <UNK> 's chair ."
i knew that man was sleeping with my mother .
"a couple times i called her "" <UNK> "" , she slapped me and told me that it 's either men in her room or her <UNK> ."
i started to be silent and to absorb all the things that were going on .
"god , i was so embarrassed of my mother in public ."
she used to dress with mini skirts and <UNK> tops ...
"my friends had good families , so i felt <UNK> and did not talk much ."
"i wrote some , but there was less writing than thoughts and feelings ."
"i started college many careers , but no <#> told me the importance of getting a college degree ."
"at the age of <#> my mom sold the big apartment and bought <#> , <#> for me and <#> for her ."
"i know i was <#> , but i was more alone than ever ."
"my brother had always been my moms reason of being , and ironically he is the <#> that has made her suffer the most ."
"ever since i was born , the role model and person i admire the most has been my grandpa leo ."
"i guess , since i was little i was ambitious , hard working and loving like he was ."
"if it was n't for the stable home of my grandparents i could have turn to drugs , sex or alcohol ."
we went to have lunch to his buddy 's place in downtown san <UNK> ...
we later went to <UNK> express and i bought some milk tea for my buddy and dropped it off at the mall ...
"i saw her for just a bit , but it was nice ... at <#>"
we went to union city to watch the notebook .
i 've been wanting to watch it for <#> weeks .
"i do n't know why , but i knew that it was my kind of movie ."
i have n't seen such a great movie in years ! ! !
"i am not the kind of person who buys dvds , but as soon as this <#> is out , i want to buy it ! ! ! !"
"after watching the movie , i wished that my love for steve was as strong as the love alley and noah had ."
"i normally tear in almost any movie , but in this <#> i cried rivers"
... it 's a must see ... an old times like love story .
"when the movie ended , everyone , or at least so it seemed , was crying ."
it was <UNK> and woke up my romantic side .
"it also deals with <UNK> , and the choice to die when ur body is giving up ."
if i were very sick or had a devastating disease i would choose to die .
"but as long as i am relatively healthy , i will never leave this world ... even if at times i wish i would be gone ..."
each day should be the first day of that miracle ...
"whoever reads this , specially you <UNK> , i love you and need"
you lots ... do n't you ever leave me alone in this sometimes cruel world ...
today was a day that i wished at many times would end .
"i wish i could just disappear , so i did n't have to feel or think certain things ."
the only moment that i seemed to be ok was when i saw <UNK> .
i was on the verge of crying when i arrived to pick her up .
the reason was absolutely stupid : just listening to a cd made me feel incredibly sad about being an <UNK> ...
then i thought about my dad and his disease ...
what if the only positive figure in my family <UNK> ...
"yes he 's abused tobacco forever , but why would it happen ?"
my mind was racing kind of continuing with yesterday 's thoughts .
"somehow , little by little <UNK> ( with her powers ) managed to make me forget for a while and we had a nice time ."
"after i left her at her house , anguish came back ."
"maybe i 'm <UNK> badly , and i try to find a logical explanation when there 's none ."
during the evening i <UNK> <UNK> and she helped me feel a little better .
at around <#> i called her without anything to say .
"i hate those times , because i feel i am boring her to death and i called just to pass time ."
"i wanted to talk some more , i was hungry for <#> of those conversations ."
maybe monday ... if nothing happens so that plans are cancelled .
"i love my buddy , today my mood was such that i could n't even tell her i loved her without feeling shy and out of place ."
"well , tomorrow has to be a better day ..."
at the beginning we <UNK> stared at each other without much to say .
"it was very comforting to see each other , but we were getting <UNK> with our new looks ."
"after <UNK> tv , i let her read the poem ."
"i 've never written a poem to a friend before , she is truly special ."
i also showed here the pics and gave small green gifts .
"it could not be another color , right ?"
"we went to lunch , and i let her drive through <UNK> ."
"when we arrived home time was running short , so we did our favorite thing to do : lay in the couch next to each other ."
i enjoy that because we are close in body and spirit .
"it was almost like a mother daughter situation , <UNK> fell asleep on my shoulders !"
"what 's amazing is that i know how hard it is for her to sleep , and being with me relaxed her to the point she could do that ."
i wish we could have some more of those moments before school starts ...
besides that nice moment something really important happened : we made a <UNK> .
"i will not smoke not even <#> drag , and she will not cut herself even <#> small cut ."
smoking and cutting are <#> self - destructive habits we have that need to die forever .
"i hope from the bottom of my heart that she does not let me down , because it could be extremely painful to overcome ."
"she has my trust and i have hers ; we are very vulnerable , but at the same time we are <#> tough women ."
it was easy to make the decision to move to the u.s .
my relationship with my dad was way too recent to change my mind .
creating a separation from my mom was what i thought i needed .
"my mom called me at my job at least <#> times a day , it was overwhelming ."
i thought leaving would be getting rid of my past problems .
"well , in reality i carried them in my luggage ..."
i desired so much to come here that i said i would quit smoking ...
"yes , every time i go i start , but i quit again ."
i moved in with steve without knowing him really .
"i was <UNK> , but otherwise i could n't ."
i missed and still do the physical contact we have in <UNK> .
"even if you do n't know people , when they are introduced to you by a friend you kiss them on the cheek ."
"at the beginning i went to do some <UNK> in sf , but after a while i was like afraid or lonely ."
"i used to stay home and watch soap <UNK> , and by the time steve got home i asked <#> questions before he could answer the first <#> !"
"i thought since i spoke some languages and had experience in <UNK> and hotels , i could get that kind of jobs ."
"in <UNK> i would have never worked at a coffee shop , especially cleaning and doing dishes ."
"finally , i decided to search for a job at a coffee shop ."
"i thought it would be easy , but without papers it was n't ."
<#> day steve got me job through a friend at sweet <UNK> 's cafe howard and <UNK> .
"every day i took the bus , and went to my daily humiliation session ."
the wife of the owner was very mean to me .
at first i was <UNK> shy to ask people to repeat what they have ordered when i did n't understand .
"her husband and brother in law liked me and were nice , but she was a bitch ."
"i worked there for a while until <#> day the bitch told me that business was slow , so they could no longer pay me ."
the husband hooked me up with another brother of his at the <UNK> 's <UNK> .
"i was given lots of <UNK> to do of huge , sticky muffin <UNK> ."
"at least i had someone to talk to , a mexican girl ( <UNK> ) ."
"customers liked me and i was not shy anymore , but i worked like an ass ."
"the owner sometimes <UNK> at me behind my back in arab , but always smiled and pretended that everything was ok ."
"he called me wet back , and i had no clue what that meant ."
i told him i had a better job offer .
"i had nothing , but my ego was still strong ."
weeks after i found a job close to where i lived ( a block away ) .
"i had to prepare food , coffee , clean , <UNK> , you name it ."
very soon i was in charge of everything and by myself .
<UNK> would only come once a day if that .
"customers loved me , and although the job was demanding i was happy ."
"<#> day , i went to work and the store was empty , <UNK> moved out the night before ."
a korean man offered me a job in a blue chip cookie store he was opening soon .
"i went to <UNK> in the time being , and started working upon return ."
"i had moved out steve 's place , but when i lost my job , he told me to go back ."
"i worked there for a bit , and steve offered me to get a civil wedding to get my papers ."
i applied for a job at office depot and got it .
"after <#> months steve proposed with a ring , and asked me to get a degree ."
"i started <UNK> , but college woke up a part of myself that had been quiet ."
"i went to community college , got my aa , and <UNK> to cal state <UNK> ."
"i wanted to go to <UNK> <UNK> , like <UNK> , but i needed to stay <#> year to finish <#> class ."
i knew that no matter where i went i would do good if i just set my mind to it .
"after graduating i got in a program to receive my teacher 's <UNK> , and i did ."
"i 've been teaching for <#> years , and i do n't think i would do anything else , although it could be stressful at times ."
"the chase of a dream has been tough , and many times i wanted to throw the towel ..."
"i did not , and as i look back i feel proud !"
no <#> in my immediate family has received a college degree .
in a way what i did is so similar to what my grandpa did ...
it 's the fucking third time i 'm writing this blog .
"well , the blog 's topic was the <UNK> of my last <#> ."
i wrote about the positive influences i had that help me endure tough times .
<UNK> was my <UNK> in my early childhood until i was <#> .
"she was there for me , and took my side when she thought i was right ."
"my mom never heard her , and punished me for things my brother did ."
"my buddy <UNK> told when i saw her recently in <UNK> , that i was always grounded ..."
"<UNK> had done , but my mom always preferred him over me ."
my mother and brother went out to have fun while i stayed home punished with <UNK> .
"i kind of liked the peace at the house , but as time went by i grew apart from my mother ."
"it is hard to show affection , when we never did ..."
"she took my side a lot , since <UNK> went crazy during my teenage years ."
"we fought at times , but minutes later we were having "" mate "" and laughing ."
"i learned to cook by watching her , although i took a couple classes with famous <UNK> from <#> to <#> ."
"<UNK> was there when i needed guidance , and gave me advice when i was loosing it ."
"i used to take him to places , and when i saw him recently i could not believe how big he 's got !"
"my mom always thought that <UNK> was partial to me , so she never listened when there was any issue w/ <UNK> ."
i think there 's a lot of <UNK> and logic to this approach to suicide .
"leaving out the legal , moral , and religious , <UNK> of this <UNK> <#> 's life <UNK> whether or not its worth living ."
"everything in a persons life , everything bears on this issue ."
"of course there are <UNK> of the moment <UNK> , made without <UNK> ."
the sudden <UNK> to commit suicide is also common for any sudden drastic life affecting <UNK> <UNK> .
"job loss , death of a close loved <#> , serious illness , loss of religious faith , loss of someone they loved ."
"in my personal life , i 've tried suicide once and thought of it a lot in the last few years ."
the <#> serious attempt happened when i was <#> years old .
"i had been in a serious car crash that had left a man <UNK> , there were a host of <UNK> circumstances , as lawyers would probably point out ."
"i was under medication that had made me <UNK> , and certainly did n't intentionally cause the car wreck that left the man <UNK> ."
but the guilt i felt was enough to make me attempt suicide .
"it was a <UNK> of the moment attempt without enough <UNK> or weighing of all the issues , but it was a serious attempt made <UNK> and with <UNK> ."
"i had taken several dozen maybe a whole bottle of <UNK> , maybe <#> bottles i do n't remember ."
but my parents had ordered pizza for dinner and woke me up .
"i went to eat some pizza , feeling <UNK> and very <UNK> ."
i ate some but the stomach full of <UNK> and the pizza combined to some might say ' <UNK> ' save my life .
"i threw <UNK> quite a bit of the pills and pizza , and was later <UNK> after they found out what i had tried to do ."
i got perspective on my life and the accident and came to realize i did n't need or deserve to die .
"years went by , i went to college and developed friends and <UNK> but never found a woman to love who loved me back ."
feeling <UNK> by women can make a man feel lonely but i never felt suicidal .
she said something no other woman ever said to me ' i love you ' .
those are some powerful words by anyone 's <UNK> to me they were the most powerful words i 'd ever heard . to know that someone loves you
is perhaps the most powerful feeling in all existence .
then to lose that ' love ' must be <#> of the most <UNK> . to be <UNK>
she never said ' i do n't love you ' to me . but
having to know i did ask her as she was walking out the door something to this effect question ... ' all those times
i said i love you and you said you loved me too ...
did you mean it ? ' the long pause ... her <UNK> framed in the doorway and then the slow <UNK> response ' i tried to mean it . '
a statement of that <UNK> could only mean <#> thing i was never loved by her .
"i 've <UNK> for my wife , my friend , my barbara for over <#> years now but perhaps it was all just a gigantic lie ... no"
i loved her soul <UNK> and to the point of death itself i loved and still love ' my barbara ' if she ever truly existed .
"but today 's barbara <UNK> ' my barbara ' of <UNK> , in appearance only ."
"a <UNK> , a creature of <UNK> that <UNK> another person , <#> who <UNK> them but who 's personality values and mind all seem totally alien and destructive ."
that 's a way i have often thought of the new barbara . but even that image failed to explain everything to my heart and mind .
millions more may be reading my blogs saying ' so what ? ' what s the big deal ?
to badly <UNK> <UNK> ' i whine therefore i am . '
"it was so quick , i did n't even have time to haul out a tissue or shed a tear ."
"( since i almost always cry at weddings , this was probably a blessing . )"
"the bride looked beautiful , the groom handsome and <UNK> ."
ca n't think of <#> people who are better suited for <#> another .
"the owner of a golf course in mississippi was confused about paying an <UNK> , so he decided to ask his secretary for some <UNK> help ."
"he called her into his office and said , "" you graduated from the university of mississippi and i need some help ."
"that night , <#> of the <UNK> returned alone , <UNK> under the weight of an <#> - point buck ."
"he 's a couple of miles back up the trail , "" the successful hunter replied ."
""" you left henry laying out there and carried the deer back ? "" they <UNK> . """
"a tough call , "" nodded the hunter . "" but i figured no <#> is going to steal henry ! """

"er ... got to busy to finish the story on time , so this was posted june 7th , <#> ."
"needless to say , i caught hell from some of mom 's friends ! ) as i said before , my brother is going to kill us ."
he 's uber - protective of my mom .
"i threw some money at melissa , the bartender ."
"making the ultimate sacrifice , i left a full glass of a decent <UNK> on the bar and headed for the car ."
"a chorus of , "" your mom is going to be fine "" followed me out the door ."
"i had visions of mom getting on the wrong train and ending up in <UNK> , iowa ."
mom passed out in some ladies room in a <UNK> <UNK> .
mom being <UNK> and pushed off the train at any station other than her own .
mom running off to vegas with the <UNK> .
i jumped into the car and headed for lake shore drive .
"i got as far as lawrence , and picked up the cell phone ."
"where did you think i 'd be ? """
"how in the hell did you get home ? """
""" i called your sister and she came and got me . "" "" but blade was there and he did n't see you . """
i 've got to get a hold of blade .

i pulled into my usual parking space and headed back into st .
"everyone started laughing , and pointed to my still - full glass sitting on the bar ."

the bad news is that i lost her for a while this weekend .

he took mom and i to breakfast on monday .
"mom was planning to come to my house in the city , and we decided that she 'd drive in with me and take the train home ."
blade could then use mom 's car during the day .
he would then pick her up at the train station in <UNK> .
"on that happy note , we parted company with blade ."
we had a glorious day in the city .
"talked to blade , and found he 'd gotten in touch with his daughter and would be dining with her ."

"friday , july <#> , <#> what i have learned from the left <UNK> clear "" <#> ."
the first rule is to question everything that the president does <UNK> in a time or war .
it is our duty in a democracy and it is <UNK> not to do so <UNK> in a time of war .
the second rule is always <UNK> the motives of the president <UNK> ’s a personal check and balance that keeps us safer .
we must always criticize the economy <UNK> of what the numbers show .
it is <UNK> to assume that ‘ america can’t be <UNK> it would <UNK> those killed on <#> not to expect more of our leaders .
"<#> . you can cover all political bases by voting for a war , but then <UNK> it later ."
this is an important rule as you will always have <#> sides to stand on regardless of the crowd that you are addressing .
"the <UNK> will respect you for voting for it , and the <UNK> will love you for <UNK> against it ."
if your <UNK> are mad that you voted for the war just vote against the funding of the war .
<#> . attempt to <UNK> everyone in the current administration even if some were appointed by your political allies .
if they mess up <UNK> them and run and blame the administration for keeping him too long .
<#> . use any minor <UNK> to <UNK> the opposition .
"try not to <UNK> the soldiers , because the american people won’t like that but the administration is fair game ."
"if you discover people putting underwear on someone else ’s head or treating a prisoner in any way less than would be expected at the <UNK> <UNK> , report ‘"
wide - spread <UNK> and keep using the word ‘
<UNK> while you are at it <UNK> <UNK> charges against the president just incase he wins a second term - start <UNK> immediately .
<UNK> any horror committed by the opposition as <UNK> for the war in general .
<#> . constantly remind your <UNK> of all the awful things that america has done <UNK> let them de - <UNK> the enemy or label them as ‘
<UNK> because they will relate it to <#> and may rally behind this corrupt administration .
this is what i have learned in the past <#> weeks in my conversations with liberals on these blogs .
"i believe that in order to join in on a political debate , you must do your research ."
i want someone to run up to the <UNK> with a mighty dean “
"alas , other than the all too brief <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> , i have been disappointed thus far ."
"so , for those of my dear , fellow republicans who opted out of watching , allow me to relay my experiences ."
"edwards walks out , hair nice and shiny ."
i write down the word “ shiny ” .
""" where i come from , you do n't judge someone 's values based on how they use that word in a political ad ."
"you judge their values based upon what they 've spent their life doing , "" internal dialogue – <UNK> ."

"now and november , you , the american people , you can reject the tired , old , <UNK> , negative politics of the past . """

does it have anything to do with the nice compliments he paid me ?

"increased security , victims <UNK> , ad - <UNK> <UNK> costs for <UNK> such as the <#> - <#> commission , and a war ."
wars ( i feel silly explaining this to you ) cost lots of money .
maybe i have to explain this to you because although your light is on <UNK> ' home .
or is it that you 're a few fries short of a happy meal . or
", that 's the <#> you used on <UNK> ."
"the republicans have fed at the federal <UNK> once they gained power , almost as much as the democrats do ."
"the democrats though , have created an entire <UNK> that is <UNK> upon government <UNK> and <UNK> the democrats with votes ."
they will always remain <UNK> unless they abandon the <UNK> mentality that the democrats have so successfully <UNK> them with for so long .
"on another note <UNK> , jen tells me you 're an ok guy ."
i 'd believe anything she says so you must be ok .
i 've read everything jen has written as far as i know and i think she is brilliant .
"and <UNK> , what was it with that "" bite me "" stuff ."
- <UNK> how about we change the subject to the weather .
how is it in your neck of the woods ?
<UNK> is anyone else freaking out because there is not a new post from <UNK> ? ? ? ?
"and the old ( well , old in that it was written yesterday ) i keep going back to re - read this comment from <UNK> ."
"in case you missed it , here is part of it ."
i think it 's fantastic . at <UNK> pm
", <UNK> <UNK> conservatives , in general , are hard - working decent people who value home , family , god and country ."
we <UNK> the political <UNK> on the far right as much as we <UNK> those on the left .
we believe that our country has <UNK> from both conservative and liberal philosophy and that neither side has a <UNK> on virtue .
"we are usually too involved with our jobs , families and churches to get very much involved with politics until the presidential election comes along ."
"we love sports , especially football , but do n't care a thing about soccer or the tour - de - france ."
we obey the law and respect law enforcement personnel .
we know that some law officers abuse their power and should be <UNK> when they do .
we do n't ask for <UNK> help and have a strong belief in self - <UNK> and taking care of our own .
we believe that abortion should be <UNK> and not available on demand as a birth control device .
we believe that the <UNK> should not pay for <UNK> nor use the tax money of those who oppose abortion to fund it .
we believe that a strong defense is a <UNK> to future <#> - <UNK> and pearl <UNK> .
we believe that the first amendment was intended to protect religion from government rather than the other way around .
we do not believe that the <UNK> should be <UNK> to religious interests and should remain <UNK> of it .
"we believe strongly in <UNK> , and that we can do things better ourselves rather than get the <UNK> involved ."
we have a <UNK> like mentality that mirrors our <UNK> .
"we are tough physically , mentally and emotionally - just like our <UNK> <UNK> were ."
we accept the <UNK> process even though we may not always agree with the results .
we do n't agree with <UNK> vs. wade but we accept it as the law of the land .
whining about a lost election <#> years after the fact by <UNK> to an <UNK> claim seems childish and immature to us .
we believe that former presidents should refrain from publicly <UNK> sitting ones and to do otherwise is <UNK> and <UNK> of the office .
"we think that clinton was <UNK> and that the president , while not <UNK> , should show some <UNK> of morality ."
we believe that having oral sex with an <UNK> in the <UNK> office is <UNK> and <UNK> .
lying about it on national <UNK> is not good either .
"we believe that theft of top secret government documents from the national archives , followed by the failure to return all that were taken is criminal ."
we do n't believe that the attorney general has done anything wrong by <UNK> this incident for the past <#> months without public comment .
we do n't believe that all liberals hate our troops but that they are often <UNK> and <UNK> to those who serve and their families .
"we do not hate liberals but love and respect them as fellow americans with many of the same wants , needs and values that we have ."
we are self - <UNK> to the extent that we try to refrain from name calling and <UNK> comments .
we are <UNK> and make mistakes but we mean well .
do you think it is possible to have political <UNK> with people who define themselves in this manner ?
"if not , then you may continue to call us insane <UNK> , etc ."
here 's hoping we can have an honest dialogue without the emotional name calling .
"<UNK> is actually government action , and of course , when private citizens make choices for whatever reason , that is not <UNK> ."
"neither is it <UNK> when a private corporation , such as usa today makes a choice as it did by refusing to run ann <UNK> 's column ."
they <UNK> with ann <UNK> 's politics and were n't interested in supporting her .
why not publish the article and let the public decide ?
"as to her style , most of us "" get it "" when she calls the democratic <UNK> the <UNK> of satan ."
"she 's kidding , making fun , not really serious and maybe a little over the top ."
i would n't use such terms to refer to those assholes but everyone has his own style .
i know this will get your motor running <UNK> .
"so <UNK> yourselves , and <UNK> in to the mind of a left - <UNK> ."
president carter just finished speaking a few minutes ago .
"al gore was on earlier , and president clinton will be up in a little while ."
i have never been so convinced in my political <UNK> before in my life .
"this country simply can not take <#> more years of w. the republicans are very afraid of losing , and it is beginning to show ."
fox news channel ( a <UNK> owned <UNK> of the republican party ) did n't even air the gore speech .
"hmmmm , did n't want to remind the viewers of who actually won <#> years ago ?"
"also , the right - wing media ( in addition to fox ) is getting increasingly nasty ."
"right - wing <UNK> - job ann <UNK> in her column today called the <UNK> convention the "" <UNK> of satan "" convention -- and which side is <UNK> ?"
"usa today correctly refused to run the column , but , of course , a far - right <UNK> website called ' human events ' ran it ."
"<UNK> is a perfect example of conservatives in america : <UNK> , <UNK> , paranoid , violent , morally <UNK> , <UNK> , and completely insane !"
the republicans have gone so far to the right that it is truly frightening in some parts of the country .
i am <#> of those people that wants to believe that all americans are on the same side .
"we may have different ideas about how to deal with our nation 's problems , but we all have the same goal ."
i have begun to question whether people on the right share that view .
their <UNK> has gotten so extreme that i am starting to believe we may be becoming a <UNK> - <UNK> type of country .
what sort of person could actually believe such crap .
"do n't be fooled , the negative tone in politics did not begin recently ."
"these far - right <UNK> began in <#> , and have never stopped ."
"we were forced to hear their garbage about bill clinton for <#> years , and the right has only gotten more negative ."
"clinton is on in a few minutes , and i do n't want to miss it . makes me <UNK> for better times ."
<UNK> ' on <UNK> in a place called <UNK> the first kick she gave was when she hit the ground banned from the usa ( paper )
anne was banned from the usa ( paper ) here 's <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> article .
i feel so <UNK> all of a sudden .
"<UNK> <UNK> from put the speakers in a cage posted : july <#> , <#> <UNK> p.m. eastern by ann <UNK> <UNK>"
"as for the pretty girls , i can only guess that it 's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the <UNK> ."
"plus , it 's no fun riding around in those <UNK> little <UNK> cars ."
"... apparently , the nuts at the democratic national convention are going to be put in <UNK> outside the convention hall ."
"sadly , they wo n't be fighting to the death as is done in <UNK> ."
"they 're calling this the "" <UNK> 's area , "" although i suppose a better name would be the "" truth - free zone . """
"i thought this was a great idea until i realized the "" nut "" category did not include <UNK> , al gore , bill clinton and teddy kennedy –"
"i 'd say the actual policy is only <UNK> nuts get the <UNK> , but little dennis <UNK> is speaking at the convention , too ."
"so it must be <UNK> for "" nuts who have not run for president as serious candidates for the democratic party . """
we 'll even let him have an hour or so of preparation before we open up .
"... walking back from the convention site , i chatted with a normal <UNK> for several blocks – who must have identified me through our <UNK> system of signals ."
"then he <UNK> himself and said he votes for the "" american . "" ..."
i 'd say i love all these democrats in boston so much
"i want them to go home , but i do n't ."
i want americans to get a good long look at the french party and keep the <#> - <#> challenge in mind .
"the radio host was talking about the "" spin "" that the kerry <UNK> put on it ."
"it 's like , you know , a like ..."
show that and <UNK> .... like ... the <UNK> that ... <UNK> .... put that together ... like ... had no ones ...
"he was responsible for the "" how to dance properly "" email that <UNK> heavily a couple years ago ."
"i <UNK> over to his site today , and found this new film ."
my fellow republicans - view this at your own risk .
"i was laughing as i watched it , but i also had to fight the urge to throw something ."
my dearest dark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> - you will love this .
through my job i have encountered famous people and their families pretty frequently over the years .
"i think if i keep it simple , i can get away with it ."
i have some favorite stories from over the years .
i still have business cards from the agents i worked with .
the last <#> i dealt with opened up about the clinton years .
she told me that all the agents she knew were thrilled to have the bush 's back in the white house .
"the clinton 's apparently treated them with contempt and like <UNK> , for the most part ."
i do n't even know where to start with them .
<#> of my employees came in to my office and told me that <UNK> <UNK> was on the phone for me .
"who is <UNK> <UNK> , you may be asking yourself ?"
i had this terrific conversation with this funny man with the familiar voice .
"we were talking about how he is close friends with <UNK> williams jr ,"
so i thought he must be a musician .
"his stage nickname was "" the big <UNK> "" ."
he was killed along with buddy holly and <UNK> <UNK> in that terrible plane crash .
his last tour being the winter dance party of <#> .
"the tour was scheduled to play in remote locations throughout mid - west united states , and the mid - west was suffering a harsh winter ."
the bus provided to the musicians had engine problems and no <UNK> system .
for this last reason <UNK> had caught the flu .
"when the tour rolled into clear lake iowa , buddy holly <UNK> a plane to fly his band to the next gig ."
"<UNK> agreed and gave his seat to <UNK> , a decision that saved him , but killed the <UNK> ."
<UNK> would feel guilty for this for some time .
"at the time of his death , <UNK> was <#> years old ."
"his wife , adrian , was pregnant with their second child ."
jay p. <UNK> would be born <#> days after his father 's death .
<UNK> 's body was <UNK> back to <UNK> by private plane .
after his funeral the streets were lined with fans watching the long <UNK> of cars moving to the <UNK> .
so i am having this conversation with <UNK> junior and it <UNK> on me who it is .
"i was raised on <UNK> senior 's song "" <UNK> <UNK>"
"<UNK> lace and a pretty face and a pony tale , hangin ' down ...."
"it turns out he even has recorded a cd , <UNK> natalie and nat king cole , with a lot of his father 's music ."
"<UNK> junior sent me signed , <UNK> photo and cd ."
i ca n't even remember the last time i actually enjoyed an encounter with a famous person or a family member of a famous person .
"over the years , when you do what i do , it is easy to become <UNK> and cynical about famous or related - to - famous people ."
i flashed back to child - hood memories with my daddy singing that big <UNK> song ...
i ca n't wait until dad gets back from florida so that i can tell him about it .
today 's topic from urllink my book : direct taxes .
"it seems some republicans ( you know , the <UNK> conservative party ) are spending $ <#> <#> of our tax dollars to prevent suicide by college students ."
the story on the senator smith sponsored bill is urllink here .
"near the end of the story , it mentions that <#> people kill themselves a year ."
smith 's urllink press release puts number of <UNK> that the bill is focusing on at <#> .
so it 's $ <#> <#> bucks to try to save <#> kids - or $ <#> each .
<UNK> is if the program is totally successful .
"if only <#> % ( <#> kids ) are saved from themselves , which i think is optimistic , that means the per life cost is $ <#> ."
"what <UNK> smith , et al is doing is taking money already <UNK> <UNK> away from the productive sector into the public sector ."
"each little chip like this <UNK> the productive , gains and wealth we might have ."
"no , i 'm not going to advocate massive consumer <UNK> ."
"but i also believe in spreading the news about a company ripping off the public , so here i go ."
i was very hungry for an early <UNK> and bought an uncle ben 's rice bowl for $ <#> at <UNK> .
"nope , the bowl has a <UNK> in the bottom much like wine bottles have and for much the same urllink reason ."
the big bowl i thought i was getting was about half the size presented .
i do n't believe the government should <UNK> this but i will encourage all readers to not buy uncle ben 's rice bowl .
we have received word that <UNK> <#> is in the making .
this means it is time to prepare the new troops .
"october <#> is not far off , if you consider building and buying swords , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
we already use the <UNK> steel combat standards as our own and we have done so since <#> whilst preparing for <UNK> .
if you want more information send us an urllink email .
this was a <UNK> of the battle of <UNK> .
"<#> years later an international force of over <#> men and women , including over <#> horse , took the field before <UNK> hill and <UNK> the battle ..."

she 's there for me in ways i do n't even ask for .
and i 've only known her for a month .
but when i 'm stressed she knows how to help me keep my head from coming undone .
i do n't know the answer to that .
i can only think of bad things to come from letting myself blog .
now i feel distant and seperate from what my life was before ( nothing to do but spend time with b .
but he 's thoroughly enjoying the time our <UNK> are <UNK> him to spend alone .
even when we 're in the same apartment together .
"do n't get me wrong , i would sell my soul before letting him go ."
we just seem to be enjoying our <UNK> states of mind right now .
but i digress .... in my outer spaces i 'm the happiest i 've ever been .
i would be up on a <UNK> <#> with blogging fever and would n't know when to shut up . ever .
:o ) i ca n't help myself .
"when i 'm into something , i 'm into it and live with <UNK> on until i 'm on to the next thing ."
"or for that matter , why eat that cake ?"
( i think we just answered the cake question . )
why do anything that you know is going to <UNK> you ?
for my first post i will copy and paste an e - mail i just sent to someone .
i 'm all moved into my new apartment with bill .
it 's a small <#> bedroom and i think my mom 's basement was bigger than it but i love it here .
it 's been a long time since i 've felt having and paying my own bills to be a <UNK> .
i 'm working for a different <UNK> now .
they started me at a great salary so i do n't stress about money anymore .
now i just stress about losing my job ( so i wo nt lose the money lol ) .
i do n't think they 've given thought <#> to firing me .
it 's just how i get when i have something i think i am <UNK> .
you 'd never know it from how i act there
have you ever heard of <UNK> - d ?
i actually went in for my first exam with my resume cuz i knew they were hiring .
seems to be the right thing for me for now .
i 've made friends with the girl i work with in the office .
she 's <#> of the most normal females i 've met since i 've moved to <UNK> .
"oh yeah , i turned <#> ( pronounced <#> fucking <#> ! ! ! ! ! )"
but i had a great b - day .
it just seemed that everyone really made a big deal over me in lots of little ways .
"things are good in ga <UNK> ) .... """
"well , if you did n't know it - i am ."
"in fact , <#> of my "" mid - year "" resolutions ( thanks donna ! ) is to do the richard petty driving experience before december ."
i 'm planning to do that in <UNK> on august <#> .
"anyway , i was reading on <UNK> today about <#> of the drivers who had "" brain fade "" ."
he said that he was talking on the radio and just drove into a wall in the garage area .
i probably should n't confess this ... sometimes i get to work
and i do n't remember anything about the drive ! !
"for safety 's sake , i 'll work on that ."
what else do n't i remember ... and how did i get to be <#> this quickly ?
i choose to do the things that i desire .
i tend to do those things that bring immediate pleasure or satisfaction .
what is the ultimate consequence of the pursuit of the immediate ?
the pursuit of the immediate <UNK> the realization of the ultimate .
if i choose <UNK> thoughts i give up loving relationships .
if i choose cookies for breakfast i give up healthy life .
if i choose angry words i give up forgiveness and <UNK> .
if i choose tv i give up thinking and the developing of my mind .
if i choose credit i give up thoughtful <UNK> and financial freedom if i choose self i give up god .
for every short term desire there is a long - term consequence .
how do i choose what is better when faced with the desire of the immediate ?
understanding this does not remove the desire for the immediate .
"it may , however , replace it with a desire that is stronger for those things that are yet future ."
this was at times an excuse to be <UNK> .
"there did however , ring a truth to this thinking ."
what good is information or knowledge if it makes no difference in my life ?
"blessing comes from living according to what is true in the universe , god 's created universe ."
"the <UNK> writes , "" the fool has said in his heart there is no god . """
he is a fool because he has made the choice to live in god 's created universe denying that there is a god .
"how dangerous to make up my own rules in life when i simply refuse to recognize the reality , because i do not like the restrictions it <UNK> ."
this is more obvious if you consider the natural laws of god 's universe .
who would be considered wise who jumps off of a cliff believing that gravity will not pull him quickly to the earth below .
to deny god 's law in this instance means death or serious injury .
could the same be true of the moral laws that god gives to us ?
to ignore or deny that they are true is to <UNK> <UNK> to our own destruction .
perhaps it is not a <UNK> denial of god 's truth that leads us to <UNK> but a distorted understanding of it .
satan in the garden twists the words of god .
it is like the sci - fi movie the matrix .
we live in the under the <UNK> of what we perceive as reality .
what is the lie that satan has sold us ?
welcome to america where we have believed that meaning and purpose is something that can be purchased .
the lust of the flesh : this is the lie that pleasure or some kind of feeling will heal our hearts .
"so we pursue relationships , sex , drink , drugs , health , food ..."
we <UNK> our minds to the terminal pain of life .
our feelings become the <UNK> in on this confusing search for what matters .
the <UNK> pride of life : this is the lie that power or position will add <UNK> to our existence .
we pursue promotion and our existence becomes about leaving some kind of mark or memorial to what great people we were .
"we become consumed with "" who 's who . """
all of these things appeal to the deep need for meaning and purpose in our lives .
truly <UNK> said in his journal god has set eternity in our hearts .
"i personally desire harmony , unity , perfection , logic , <UNK> , beauty ."
these things in their perfect form are only found in god .
"i know their must be something more , simply because i am not satisfied with what is ."
"yes , a- grade ! there was an open race at <UNK> on the weekend so the field was <UNK> ."
but we took off and left them behind pretty quickly .
"actually , when i say we , i mean the rest of a- grade took off and i held on ."
there were only <#> of us and that meant there was nowhere to hide .
"and i started taking turns , albeit short ones ."
rain and wind <UNK> throughout the entire race .
there were <#> guys in the bunch that were heaps stronger than the rest and occasionally ( or was it frequently ? )
<#> of them would take off and get a gap on us .
same <UNK> and <#> less person to do it .
it seemed like we spent the entire race chasing someone .
at the end of the first lap ( <#> km ) i was just happy that i was still with them .
<#> of the strong guys got away and the other strong guy stopped taking turns .
we eventually caught the <UNK> with about <#> km to go .
we went over blood hill and he took off again .
with <#> km to go <#> of the other guys dropped off the back and so <#> of us tried to chase .
i was shattered but wanted to make sure i was with them at the end .
"at some point we realised that we were n't going to catch the break , probably about <UNK> out and we began <UNK> each other up ."
"still i just wanted to make sure i did n't get dropped , even this close to the line ."
i suppose the near miss caused me to panic .
maybe i would have been able to get past .
there was a bike length in it and i was utterly spent !
i can only hope that with a bigger bunch i will be able to hide a little more often !
not <UNK> to <UNK> stats but a big jump up for me .
it 's a pity really that i will only get <#> more scratch races up there this season .
"i should point out that <#> of the guys in a grade made the comment that he was the "" first <#> <UNK> . across the line "" ."
taking up competitive cycling at <#> was n't too late afterall .
too busy to do much more now as i 'm at work .
when i hear it it is like a call to the <UNK> at sunrise .
i feel a heartbeat and it makes me feel a little more alive .
"it has <UNK> my prayer , and surely that ca n't be a bad thing ?"
this is your mother speaking : is he a giant ? to you he must be at <UNK> .
to me he is equal ( and i am <UNK> <#> and a bit ) . to your <#> your old eyes
is that why you started calling him mr sunshine all those years ago ?
"that is good , this <#> year old mom is not going to destroy the <UNK> ..."
i hope he answers your funny <UNK> little writings .
maybe he does n't realise the effort you put into them .
elizabeth and i took a tube from <UNK> to <UNK> east .
had a <UNK> <UNK> curry with the most <UNK> rice i have ever had .
not bad for <#> <UNK> for both of us .
now this was like entering a foreign country .
in the middle of london and even the <UNK> was in <UNK> .
<UNK> joined us after several calls on cell phones : where are you ....
"i ca n't see you ( well no , we we trying on shoes inside a shop ) ."
"i was soooo proud of myself , walked through a whole market and entered <#> shops without getting out credit cards or cash ."
instead i spend my birthday money on my friends .
found the graduate art exhibition spread out over the whole old <UNK> <UNK> site .
<UNK> was easy to find ( thank you adam for telling me they would be there ) .
he now wants to add on to it but ca n't because he has run out of space at home .
", tomorrow i will pay the very very painful price ."
"this evening , we <UNK> between the short story and novel format ."
"i read my urllink the <UNK> and we discuss its problems , urllink <UNK> ."
"sharon <UNK> ian <UNK> ’s urllink <UNK> ( <#> ) , which she ’s enjoying ."
we read a few passages from henry miller ’s urllink <UNK> of <UNK> .
"then , i finish by reading a short selection of urllink <UNK> <UNK> book on short story ."
"i feel like i do too much of the talking , though most of it is reading to the group ."
"i’m <UNK> , honestly , they like my reading voice so , and will keep trying to please them ."
every now and then you see a post on <#> of the forums that goes something like this .
"look at it like this . during the <UNK> phase you start with <#> chips , you buy some more depending on <UNK> obviously ."
say you have <#> <UNK> and so have paid for <#> chips .
"it doesn’t matter how many , what i’m saying is that you bought <#> ( or however many ) chips ."
at the end of the game how many chips do you have ?
you should be grateful to be given any money at all !
it ’s the guy who wins who as a real cause for complaint .
but he only gets paid <#> % of their value .
and people want to make first prize even less !
i adapt my play to the structure at hand .
"i’m not interested in £ <#> for finishing 9th when first is a grand , £ <#> or more ."
if you don’t like playing <#> hours for little reward then you are in the wrong game .
"why have you chosen to play on a wednesday , when there are <#> runners ?"
when it takes all night to finish the game ?
when only <#> % of the field gets a decent return ?
there is a lot more to <UNK> your <UNK> than the size of first prize .
"<UNK> with fewer runners give you more chance of a decent return , more time to play ( generally ) and usually have <UNK> fields ( on average ) ."
you can’t win £ <#> in <#> night but so what ?
<#> night isn’t how you should be thinking about it .
think about over the whole year . or <#> years . or a lifetime .
play to win and think harder about which game you should be in instead of asking the world to change to suit you !
last week the “ european <UNK> ” are ran at the vic .
"they held <#> <UNK> on the sunday and a huge <#> on friday , the night before the main event ."
"was i there , chasing the big prize ? no way !"
these <UNK> are a bad deal <UNK> . here
’s why : · tough fields .
"the <UNK> themselves are a bit of a mixture , but many of the best players do play . but"
winning a seat is only half the battle .
then you have to come back and play in a very tough line up .
"apparently on the sunday there were <#> runners in the £ <#> satellite , with <#> seats given away ."
satellite <UNK> had a <#> % chance of winning a seat ( less if not prepared to <UNK> ) .
"if you qualify , <#> % of the field usually get paid in the main event ."
"that ’s <#> <#> - <#> shots , a <#> - <#> double !"
you have a <#> % chance of making any money at all .
· even smaller chance of a big win .
"the majority of the money goes to the top <#> places ( which is only right , i have no complaint with that ) ."
"if your target comp has <#> runners , you have a <#> in <#> chance of finishing top <#> ."
<UNK> that up with your <#> % chance of winning a seat – <#> to <#> . and that ’s assuming your skill level is around the average ! ·
"the vic made £ <#> from every direct <UNK> , that ’s all they’re allowed to ."
"but with the <UNK> , <#> <UNK> at £ <#> each makes £ <#> from <#> seats !"
plus the £ <#> they take off the satellite winners !
"and if you do win a seat , your expenses ( travelling , time off etc ) are <UNK> as well ."
"not a problem if you consider it as entertainment , but this is time you could be making money in better games ."
"· <UNK> , <UNK> , aren’t entertaining at all ."
repeat ad <UNK> while waiting for someone else to be knocked out .
i tend to <UNK> fears of <UNK> in normal <UNK> .
there isn’t a great deal someone can do to help a partner without hurting themselves almost as much .
in other words it ’s not easy for a <UNK> to gain a significant edge over the rest of the field by <UNK> . and
"in a super - satellite , it ’s a different story ."
"once you get close to the end , you often find that up to half the remaining players are virtually certain of <UNK> ."
these players can help their mates out a lot without <UNK> themselves at all .
"when your mate goes all - in , you fold !"
i believe this goes on quite a lot .
"if you’re playing it straight , on your own , this can really hurt you sometimes ."
"of course , as always in poker , there are <UNK> as well ."
"just <#> more thing , in the style of <UNK> , to think about ."
"if you <UNK> a lot of self - esteem from playing and being seen in the biggest games around , get a grip ."
"you could get professional therapy for a <UNK> of the cost and a real , long - term benefit ."
"for many years , <UNK> played in the biggest game in town ."
"they weren’t <#> of the major faces , but they were nobody ’s fish ."
they made a decent living and were quietly respected by those who knew .
"accept what had happened , keep playing within their means and <UNK> ?"
<UNK> <UNK> big to try to regain their former status .
a lot of money was <UNK> around on some big <UNK> .
"some came off for a while ( john spencer ) , others were losers from the start ( mike <UNK> ) ."
"<UNK> started <UNK> big , desperately trying to get back in the biggest game ."
"that money went , but they wouldn’t slow down ."
<UNK> were forced out of the second - <UNK> game and went broke .
"<UNK> then did what every true poker player would do , <UNK> broke with <UNK> <UNK> round the block ."
"in football this is called “ going into administration ” , but face it , they just knocked them all back ."
i don’t know how football clubs get away with it .
"all the <UNK> in the poker world could learn a lot from <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"now <UNK> are back in the <#> round of each , also known as division <#> ."
"newly humble , they are working hard , <UNK> it back up , and avoiding the eyes of those they <UNK> ."
"but at least they’re working hard , and still in action ."
"and as long as you’re still in action , then you’ve got a chance ."
why is europe and particularly britain obsessed with hold - em to the <UNK> of all other tournament games ?
i have a strong preference for both <UNK> and <UNK> and feel that the good player has a much bigger edge in these games .
nl hold - em is <UNK> the game when the tournament <UNK> are highest . if you’re a wannabe <UNK> or <UNK> it ’s the only game to play .
"if you are a wannabe money maker though ( aren’t i clever ) , i’m not so sure ."
"hold - em , especially no - limit , is just too damn easy to play when the blinds get high ."
wait for a hand you like and shove it in .
"just <#> decision to make , and not a hard <#> ."
"no <#> ’s going to get it wrong with aa , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"no <#> ’s going to get it wrong with <#> , <UNK> , <#> and <#> % of all the hands in the deck ."
"if anyone gets it wrong with the small number of <UNK> hands like <#> pictures or a middle pair , they’re not going to get it very wrong ."
"even if your <UNK> opponent is calling instead of raising , he ’s only in real trouble when you can find an <UNK> against him . and"
those hands just don’t come along very often .
"notice i said an <UNK> , not <UNK> ."
"when the blinds are high , a bit of a crap - shoot ."
"maybe , but not as much of <#> ."
there is a lot less pre - flop raising in <UNK> <UNK> .
good players know that they should keep the pot smaller until they see the flop .
that ’s where you <UNK> your <UNK> opponents in <UNK> . and
the <UNK> players just don’t know where they are pre - flop .
"it ’s not as easy as “ big pair or <UNK> means raise ” , like hold - em ."
so more of them ( not all ) tend to just call as well .
all this means you get much more play on the flop .
"more time , more decisions to be made , to sort the sheep from the <UNK> ."
"when the blinds are high , you have to put some raises in ."
but at least you don’t have your legs taken out from under you when the rock finds aa behind you .
people mis - value their hands in short - stack situations .
hold - em players love pairs in their hand but any pair apart from <UNK> is an <UNK> odds hand in <UNK> .
you want to take a flop cheap and try to hit a set .
in an all - in or <UNK> situation you would usually prefer to have <#> different cards to hit <UNK> and <#> pair with .
especially against the main hand that ’s going to call you – <UNK> .
pot - limit <UNK> is just about the best tournament game you can play against weak players .
it ’s a shame that it ’s only regularly played in <#> card - room in the world .
but it ’s great that that card - room is <#> minutes from my flat !
last year i won <#> out of <#> small <UNK> <UNK> i played in .
given the size of the field that ’s about <#> times more often than average .
"if you can do that in hold - em you have either found a fantastic game or you are a hell of a player , or both ."
"sometimes ram <UNK> plays in the £ <#> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> ( thankfully for me , the £ <#> events are beneath him ) ."
i’d back him at <#> - <#> in a field of <#> .
i don’t want to give away too many trade secrets here .
i don’t mind telling you how much i win or lose but exactly how i do it – <UNK> in the car park :-) .
"a great deal of it is not because it ’s <UNK> per se , but because the game is played with <UNK> rather than blinds ."
"in conclusion , maybe i have answered my own question ."
"weak , <UNK> players don’t get <UNK> out in tournament hold - em like they would in the other <#> games ."
"they have a chance , they stay in action , they get a few results and so do their friends ."
"if you see me at a festival between now and christmas , it ’s likely to be in <#> of those ."
"if you see me at a festival at all , but that <#> ’s for another day ."
but i was <UNK> through the times last weekend and i saw danny baker ’s column .
"i like danny baker ( whatever anyone says ) so i read it , and he was talking about meeting jimmy white ."
"hey , i don’t care , it ’s not as though he ’s stolen the title from me ."
and i had £ <#> on him to win the thing anyway !
how did i know he was going to do it ?
"i just had a fair idea that with a fast clock and a no - limit structure , any aggressive player had a chance ."
pot - limit i would have needed <#> - <#> or more .
and this simple fact blows all this crap about “
no - limit is the <UNK> of poker games ” out of the window .
"cash games where everyone has huge <UNK> and <#> days to set up their opponents , maybe ."
people win no - limit <UNK> who wouldn’t have a <UNK> ’s chance in hell playing <UNK> or <UNK> .
"because when you get lucky in no - limit , you can get lucky for all someone ’s chips . all in <#> go and that ’s them fucked ."
it must be said though that at times the better players push themselves out on a <UNK> .
many players are so conditioned to playing <UNK> they don’t know any other way .
"classic example from the poker <#> heat , roy <UNK> and steve davis were heads up , fairly equal chips ."
"all <UNK> needed to do was sit tight , play poker , keep <UNK> away and not give davis a chance to get lucky ."
"what he did was blast it all in with some crap ( ten high or something i can’t remember ) , davis found <UNK> , thank you and goodnight ."
"at least joe was in front , but why shove it all in and give his <UNK> opponent a chance to get lucky ?"
if you ask anyone what ’s so great about no - limit
"well you can lose all your chips on <#> hand , <#> mistake and it ’s over ” ."
"well , <#> bad beat and it ’s over too ."
a good player can normally <UNK> a <UNK> opponent into getting the chips in as a <#> - <#> favourite ( on average ) .
"if you can beat someone <#> % of the time , which would you prefer , best of <#> or a <#> - off <UNK> ?"
in no - limit it ’s all or nothing .
is the tennis world <UNK> played over <#> game ?
so why is poker so often played over <#> hand ?
i do appreciate people coming on here to read my insane <UNK> so i am going to throw you a bone or <#> .
some useful hints as to how to put me on <UNK> .
these are the things to do at a poker table which wind me up .
number <#> : if there is <#> thing that gets on my tits in poker <UNK> it ’s the habit that some people have of endlessly <UNK> every hand .
"oh sorry , is it me , hang on while i <UNK> around with my cards a bit more , i call ."
the next time someone asks me “ was i right to call ” * i’m going to say “
"god no , that ’s the worst call i’ve ever seen ” ."
and if that doesn’t work we might end up having a real post <UNK> .
* especially if they do it in the style of a scottish great - aunt asking for just <#> wee piece of <UNK> .
poker has so many <UNK> in real life .
"poker is life , some would say ! here is a tale of <UNK> that a good poker player would have avoided ."
"but when she went to pay for the plant , the <UNK> assistant accused her of <UNK> a £ <#> tag for a £ <#> tag …"
the matter probably could have been resolved <UNK> had miss <UNK> - <UNK> not spotted <#> of her biggest <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> queue .
"exactly how you can have a “ <UNK> rival ” , miss b - g did not leave her ego at home like any good poker player would ."
"she also <UNK> a huge amount for a small <UNK> , going “ all - in ” to a very small pot ."
"she lost the case , and is now <UNK> for £ <#> in legal fees ."
if only she had spent more time in <UNK> <UNK> and less out in the fresh air .
"in closing , let us consider the words of that great <UNK> nelson <UNK> ."
the other saturday i played the £ <#> hold - em tournament in <UNK> .
before the start i bumped into that well known internet <UNK> “ the camel ” .
"haven’t seen you at a hold - em comp for a while ” he said , before we moved to the bar and started talking about <UNK> instead ."
"he was right , i haven’t been playing a lot of hold - em lately . here"
"’s why : in <#> , i played <#> £ <#> and £ <#> <UNK> in <UNK> ( mostly £ <#> ) ."
"i cleared almost exactly £ <#> per competition , £ <#> ."
"last year i played <#> and cleared £ <#> , at £ <#> a night barely enough to cover <UNK> as they used to say in <UNK> ."
in fact i have put together a spectacular run of <#> of these <UNK> without making the money . considering all hold - em <UNK>
needless to say i have given some thought to the question “ what the hell is going on ? ” .
the possible reasons can be broken down into <#> categories : <#> ) the game has changed there ’s no doubt this is true .
"games always change , they grow and shrink , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
have the games changed in such a way to explain my results ?
"in <#> , the saturday night game was a very good game , and that was the game i played the most ."
"there weren’t too many top players , and quite a few <UNK> chasing the biggest prize pot of the week ."
"however , word got around , <#> way or the other ."
more and more good players started turning up to take advantage .
"once certain players who spend <#> % of their time in cash games at the vic turn up to a weekly tournament , you know the party ’s over ."
"not because they’re great players , but because this is a sign that the particular tournament was good value <#> months ago ."
the fields on saturdays are now much <UNK> .
wednesday is a £ <#> comp with <#> runners .
"for various reasons which i will discuss soon ( but not today ) , the good player ’s edge is cut dramatically ."
plus it goes on till <#> am and more – not good on a school night !
"in addition , the more <UNK> of you might have remembered that add - <UNK> were introduced in late <#> ."
"i don’t think this has affected my earn , but it ’s hard to tell ."
"however , as a player who tends to the conservative in <UNK> , i think the <UNK> have increased my <UNK> ."
but when i do i should win more .
am i playing as well as i did in <#> ?
"there is no doubt that i’m not as confident , which must have some effect ."
"<UNK> , it really doesn’t matter how confident you are ."
"it might feel a lot different , but it isn’t ."
"as i haven’t been doing so well , i haven’t been playing as often ."
i have only played <#> of these <UNK> in the first half of this year ( compare to <#> in the whole of <#> ) .
maybe there is a <UNK> loss of <UNK> .
i have been trying some different plans and theories – now is the time after all .
"don’t screw with your game too much when you’re winning , that ’s for sure ."
some of these new plans might not be good ideas in the long run .
and frankly i just haven’t been trying very hard lately .
after about half an hour i’m bored and wish i was at home .
"so instead of <UNK> , i hit the rail ."
<#> ) them ’s just the breaks even <#> <UNK> isn’t very many .
think of the difference a win more or less can make – anything up to £ <#> !
"it ’s human nature to assume that <#> was the way things should be , and everything since has been caused by bad luck and <UNK> factors ."
but there ’s no logical reason why that should be so .
"i ran hot in <#> , and cold since ."
overall i have cleared £ <#> in <#> <UNK> .
"i’d certainly like that £ number to be higher , but it ’s not bad ."
most players would <UNK> with me for sure .
a bit of all <#> but mostly the last i reckon .
"since the start of <#> , while i have been struggling with the hold - em , i have cleared £ <#> in <#> <UNK> <UNK> ."
i’ll let you know in about <#> years when the <UNK> are covered .
"in the meantime , now you know why i’m not seen too often on the hold - em nights ."
finally a <UNK> .. i know <#> or <#> guys who are running great in hold - em <UNK> right now .
but we’ll see how good these boys are when they string together <#> without a win .
we’ll see how they cope when that happens .
and we’ll see how <UNK> they are then too j.
"why are we all here , but let ’s not get all <UNK> ."
"i have decided to quit the well - known poker forums at least for the meantime , and post my thoughts here instead ."
unfortunately the signal - to - noise ratio on all the european forums has <UNK> badly over the last few months .
mostly they are <UNK> with anonymous smart - <UNK> who have nothing to contribute at all .
"these are open forums and i have always said that <UNK> should be <UNK> in these forums , so what can i do ."
all i can do is decide that i can’t be bothered with it any more .
"however i do enjoy <UNK> my thoughts and <UNK> feedback from anyone who does want to be constructive , so here i am ."
so i’m going to talk about anything i feel like .
first of all i must apologise for the delay in updating the diary .
i have been moving house - i am now resident in <UNK> 's <UNK> <UNK> apartment block ( and that 's saying something ) .
"hopefully the minor <UNK> that i have n't finished selling my old flat yet wo n't result in me moving once more , into <UNK> 's <UNK> <UNK> ."
"while this was ongoing , literally <#> e - mail <UNK> in demanding an update ."
"i did promise you some gossip from <UNK> , but unfortunately the fact that <UNK> clark sleeps in his car is apparently common knowledge -"
<UNK> all the same though is n't it ?
apart from that i did catch a couple of the <UNK> <UNK> on espn .
"there was a <UNK> programme devoted to each day , i saw the ones covering days <#> and <#> ."
"these are very well done , the commentary is good and the atmosphere comes over very well ."
however i did hear something that calls the whole concept into question .
"there was a hand on day <#> where on the espn show , <UNK> <UNK> ( sp ? )"
"has <UNK> in his hand , and <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> ."
"hong goes all in with his trip kings , <UNK> has a bit of a dwell - up and passes ."
"this guy i was talking to said he was at the table , and there were no card - cameras ( it was not the main featured table ) ."
or did he just tell the espn guys that was what he had ?
it ’s not hard to think of reasons why he might want to do that .
should we take all this coverage with a pinch of salt ?
"<#> to think about . finally in an attempt to shame myself into never doing this again , here is the worst play i have ever made ."
in the big blind i pick up something including <#> .
"no <UNK> until the turn makes the board <UNK> , so i have the nuts , with <#> diamonds out ."
i bet the pot ( <#> ) <#> caller .
on the river i still have the nuts .
"at least the <UNK> was on the next table , not there to pour <UNK> on me !"
is how you play the game more important than whether you win or lose ?
"most people , in this post - <UNK> world , would mock someone who said that ."
i used to play a lot of cricket .
"i suppose it was my main hobby , much like poker is now ."
now i look back on my <UNK> “ career ” ( in quotes because i really wasn’t very good at all ) .
"what do i regret ? losing this game , being <UNK> that season ?"
what i regret is that we had a bent <UNK> and we never did anything about it .
"i’m still embarrassed about the cheating that went on , to my benefit ."
it got to the point where i would never appeal unless it was stone <UNK> out but that wasn’t enough .
"there were reasons , or should that be excuses , as to why i didn’t stand up to it ."
in fact he passed away shortly after i left the club .
"i think of the times when opponents would as much as call us <UNK> , and we couldn’t say anything , because it was true ."
i hope that when i look back on my poker playing i will have a clearer conscience .
do my best and nuts to what anyone thought .
i must <UNK> this with telling you about my <UNK> <UNK> .
"after a car accident we had in <#> , i developed a bump on the top of my wrist that seemed firm , but <UNK> ."
"this bump grew in size over a series of months and most times did n't <UNK> or hurt , though i felt it <UNK> ."
occasionally it would seem to press on nerves and cause some <UNK> like pain in my wrist .
"<#> time when i twisted my wrist in an <UNK> manner opening a refrigerator door in a store , it immediately went away ."
mine has come and gone and currently it is in the gone phase .
"it is an <UNK> , but does n't really bother me too terribly enough to have surgery to attempt to permanently remove it ."
"most times these occur on the top of the wrist , though others have gotten them at their ankles , the joint of their thumb , or elsewhere ."
"well , anyway , i had a dream the other evening that i developed something similar on the top rear right side of my head ."
i have to ponder this <#> to figure out the potential meaning behind it .
i was watching the information about this on a tv even though the power was out supposedly .
"i felt a fear rising in my throat , climbing up every <UNK> in my neck like an <UNK> ."
my husband was packing for us to <UNK> to a <UNK> we visit often that would have their doors open for friends .
i woke up shocked and the dream had felt so real at the time .
this was before the most recent announcement of the threat by our dept . of homeland <UNK> .
i tend to see these announced threats now as a political <UNK> ...... especially in this election year .
i fear that bush will attempt to <UNK> the election more than i fear an actual attack at this point .
""" make ready the way of the lord . """
"dear <UNK> , don’t mind if i call you , “ <UNK> ?"
” hope that ’s not wrong ( no pun intended ) .
the minister in my church keeps going on and on <UNK> that there is a trinity and that it ’s in the bible .
"i find myself lining up more with what you say in your book , a new christianity for a new appetite ."
should my pastor cling to this <UNK> doctrine ?
"<UNK> <UNK> , oh dear <UNK> , you seem to think you are a funny guy ."
we can’t all be steve martin and it always amazes me how many people think they have a sense of humor .
"your minister , it seems to me , has a great deal of pride ."
he makes the common mistake of <UNK> his interpretation of scripture on the rest of us .
this lack of awareness and education is <UNK> in our churches .
"i , for example never impose my views in an <UNK> way on my <UNK> or my <UNK> ."
"and if i hear of any of them doing it , i put a stop to it immediately and punish the <UNK> ."
"the trinity is a concept invented by a fourth century church council , not something jesus , peter or paul talked about ."
"oh , i know they talked about a father , a son and a holy spirit , and about these <#> persons being god , but since the word"
isn’t used i like to say that it isn’t a biblical concept .
what ’s important to grasp is your experience of the divine .
"this is something , along with your education at a <UNK> , non - <UNK> university , that you can always trust ."
i feel the spirit when i do my many good deeds and acts of charity .
i encounter the son when i am inspired to give a large portion of my paycheck to the needy .
"i see a pattern in the flow of history , a presence closer than my breath that speaks of the father ."
this is why i choose a christian interpretation of the divine .
"but do you see me <UNK> my buddhist , <UNK> , islamic or <UNK> brothers and sisters because they do not encounter the divine the same way ."
"if your minister continues to insist on this tired , old reading of christianity , i suggest you find another congregation to worship in ."
"and by all means purchase my book , the way i see it : the death of objective logic ."
it can be yours for a <UNK> of $ <#> .
"dear bishop <UNK> , i’ve just finished reading tom <UNK> ’s the greatest generation ."
the stories of sacrifice for the benefit of future generations reminded me of christ ’s <UNK> sacrifice for us .
several accounts in the book moved me to tears .
"being a regular reader of your column , i would love to hear your thoughts on the world war ii generation and their christian example ."
"<UNK> south dakota dear <UNK> , i’m sure mr ."
"i certainly have strong emotions for individuals who lived during the difficult times of the <#> ’s and <#> ’s , including my own mother and father ."
"however , i am sure you are not ignorant of the <UNK> committed by white european males in this country and elsewhere for centuries ."
"neither , <UNK> , should we <UNK> to solving our <UNK> with the evils of war ."
"( do you see a pattern here , or is it just me ? ) ."
perhaps the root of this behavior is the idea of the very event you mention .
"many people , like you , <UNK> , <UNK> the story of the bloody sacrifice that many have portrayed as the <UNK> point of christianity ."
<UNK> message was about peace and life and tolerance .
"jesus , it is now known , probably lived his days out in peace , living with a woman who bore him children ."
"this is not what the winners in history , the <UNK> writers of the new testament want you to believe ."
"after all , you do n't still believe that god created the earth in <UNK> <#> days , do you ?"
a <UNK> god who <UNK> people for living out their sexual preference ?
these ridiculous ideas should be wiped from our memory along with the <UNK> attitude they inspire .
"thus , they <UNK> and destroyed all other views ."
this bloody event did indeed inspire the world war ii generation .
"it inspired the german christians and the <UNK> christians to murder each other , not to mention many millions of jews ."
"if this <UNK> <UNK> event inspired your parents or you , your tears should be tears of shame , not <UNK> ."
"i suggest you read my book , how i know everything perfectly and <UNK> from a distance of <#> years ."
send <#> and i will ensure you and parents all get a copy .
want to put a <UNK> from urllink <UNK> on the next match then mr <UNK> * * * * ?
"as i will be <UNK> next week , it gives stuart time to practice and get his <UNK> game back in order ."
"i expect a much closer encounter in a <UNK> , but the only way i can <UNK> defeat is with a urllink change of venue ."
satan won <#> - <#> with his monster <#> ounce <UNK> from urllink frank in <UNK> proving that new equipment really does make a difference .
"he wins control of this blog - unfortunately he is off to <UNK> for a week or so , so do n't expect too much while he 's there ."
"do n't expect anything from me , either , i 'm far too <UNK> ."
( does it surprise anyone that the lord of darkness <UNK> in urllink <UNK> ?
"lots of <UNK> , so to speak . )"
.... i am the proud owner of a new stick which i look forward to beating you with .
its the bottom blue <#> in urllink this picture .
i got stuffed at squash today despite my fancy new <UNK> so i 'm going to be looking for revenge tomorrow night .
are you going to be <UNK> a fancy new cue ?
what better way to predict stuart 's mood on a thursday morning than visiting our urllink results and statistics webpage .
thank you microsoft for making this server page active ...
"a good article on urllink <UNK> <UNK> which gives good tips about how to gain that unfair advantage , as does urllink this with practical examples urllink here ."
"my <UNK> is <UNK> nicely , off to buy my <UNK> new cue now ! ! ! !"
disclaimer : satan does not <UNK> these tactics ( within reason ) .
ensure a steady supply of <UNK> and encourage <UNK> drinking .
bring the topic of conversation around to microsoft .
introduce massive <UNK> in the speed of my playing .
"i have invited urllink satan , my opponent in the wednesday night race to <#> , to join this blog : we <UNK> his eager acceptance ."
followed undoubtedly by <UNK> of <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> on me yesterday - <#> - <#> .
<UNK> but still good practise exercises : urllink here .
"a close run game tonight , <UNK> had the better of the early <UNK> , cruising to a <#> - <#> lead ."
"i pulled it back to <#> all , then close all the way to <#> all ."
"a good <UNK> by <UNK> in the next frame , followed by a <UNK> <#> to <UNK> it <#> - <#> ."
"not long to go now , satan is mentally prepared to make it <#> in a row ."
"however stuart , <UNK> by his squash playing and new - found <UNK> , will be a tough nut to crack tonight ."
he even refused the prospect of fast food <UNK> ( something very strange is going on ) .
i 'm off to dose up on <UNK> c and caffeine ...
can <UNK> sue me for using that as a title ?
"well , the picture thing is a bust ."
<UNK> through ie and treat the site like another directory .
works great if we do it that way through our web space . just slow as heck on a dial - up connection .
"probably not the <UNK> per se , but at least a nice democrat who was wearing his <UNK> button ."
"<UNK> <UNK> under the <UNK> of a charity , but really something else ( even if it 's a <UNK> with which i agree ) ."
"top it off with trying to wash <UNK> 's high chair tray and conduct <UNK> communication with my wife , and i was a little out of it ."
"i at first assumed he meant in my neighborhood , but most of my neighbors seem to be immigrants ( asian and <UNK> ) , <UNK> <UNK> ("
"of course , maybe he started on the far end of my side of the street , that seems to be the white , young crowd in the neighborhood ."
so i can blog all day and then suddenly publish half a dozen posts
the most amusing piece of email that crossed my desk today was an ongoing conversation with <#> friends about <UNK> .
ap mountain biking story first of all - who bikes <#> miles in an hour and <#> minutes on a challenging trail ?
"a <#> <#> and <#> pound individual burns significantly less , about <#> an hour ( depends on the speed ) according to <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i figured the reasoning was , <UNK> . is carrying the weight of the nation on his shoulders , so if there are <#> <#> people in the u.s ."
"he chooses to use the calories <UNK> of <#> people losing money because of his tax <UNK> policies , etc ."
he had <UNK> <#> calories to spare he could have claimed and somewhere <#> poor people did n't lose weight .
"the article itself is hilarious if you read it carefully - $ <#> mountain bike , toe clips ( not <UNK> ) , the reporter watching <UNK> ."
"he pants hard , <UNK> low "" <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> "" <UNK> with each stroke of the <UNK> , his shoulders <UNK> up and down ."
did i mention i have to use <UNK> because the hard drive on this laptop is nice and small ?
"anyway , did n't i promise an <UNK> ( or <UNK> as i so nicely put it before i edited it ) ?"
"i noticed that i can fill in a rather extensive <UNK> in the tool that comes with blogger , so i 'll do that instead ."
"feel free to <UNK> my favorite books , movies , etc ."
i 'll try to find a <UNK> picture of myself on the web tomorrow that can serve as an <UNK> .
thought i should run a test to see if i can get pictures into my site if they 're uploaded to my home page .
"i guess i should have known , if you can maintain a telephone conversation , you should be able to maintain a data connection ."
"i could simply clean it completely and start from scratch , but that sounds like a headache beyond imagining ."
all of a sudden the hope i had that my book would be published has become a reality and now of course time is of the essence ....
"because now the story that is directly from my heart , as well as my life will be public and open to <UNK> ..."
i always did believe ' be careful what you wish for ... you just might get it ! '
"in other <UNK> of my life , things are picking up with sweets ..."
interestingly enough it is an <UNK> to be in love with someone and not be sexually active at all .
sweets and i have never been sexually active with <#> another for no other reason then we have n't gone that far yet ... today
i was laughed at by someone because we did n't live together or have a sexual relationship ...
of course then she went into a <UNK> about the very husband she lives with and has sex with ....
... she 's miserable doing the very thing sweets and i have n't . not sure why she laughed ....
seems to me the fact that we are happy and she and her hubby are not speaks <UNK> .
people ... go figure ... their as <UNK> as time ....
once again i found myself getting lost in the world of my book and within the feelings of the characters ...
"sometimes while writing i become so <UNK> in what the characters are feeling , my own feelings seem to die off ."
lol so i little about me ; where to begin ?
i have no family left alive so essentially i am all alone in this world now .
"most find that <UNK> , i have found it almost easier to be alone then to deal with the family ties ."
i am a tiny person standing just under <#> foot tall and weighing less then <UNK> .
i honestly hate describing myself so other then the above description i think i will not bother .
spirit knows i do n't need this to sound like some bad personal add ....
"lol obviously my passion is my work , otherwise i would n't become so wrapped up in it and need an escape of some sort ."
"due to my work i often spend time alone , although i would n't call myself a ' <UNK> ..."
i do enjoy the company of others as long as they are n't stupid .
"there is nothing wrong with not knowing something , thereby having to acquire the knowledge ... but"
when your just plain stupid ..... <UNK> that kills me .
".... of course the world would be pretty dull without stupid people ... but none the less , i could stand to see a lot less of them !"
well i have wasted enough useless brain cells <UNK> here for now ...
i had best get back to work .... hopefully soon i can pull myself away from my work enough to work on this blog ... keep your fingers crossed !
there is nothing more exciting then moving into and learning more about a new home ... during the day today that is precisely what i am doing .
i should be working but what the hell right ?
i guess this is home sweet home now . ....
i no longer have the <UNK> class . and to those who have been reading my journal i know i have <#> days more to write about .
i have them written in my paper journal just need <UNK> <UNK> to myself to type it in here .
i started my 4th class of the summer .
i have spent all day in this class <UNK> and i feel like <#> of my <UNK> from last week .
if i had a <UNK> i would skin myself .
"i could barely understand anything that came out of the man 's mouth except for <#> line "" is this clear what i am saying "" ."
holy fucking cow ! ! ! ! ! ! !
my <#> worse nightmares bill gates meets <UNK> makes me want to <UNK> cows ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"have you heard of the <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ?"
he stayed up all night contemplating <UNK> there really is a dog do you know the difference between a monkey and and <UNK> ?
pushing the <UNK> is like trying to control a shopping cart with a broken wheel .
thank god they are dead because i <UNK> their heads into the corner of the lab table as i <UNK> them out .
finished working on the legs then soaked the muscles down with water packed them with dripping wet handy <UNK> and then tied the skin <UNK> closed . then
"we named him <UNK> , to the right side of the <UNK> flipped his stiff <UNK> body over onto his back ."
<#> of the guys in my group was having a very hard time dealing with now that the body was face up .
he said this was <UNK> it was now more real that we were <UNK> a person becasue he now had a face .
i started to make a <UNK> vertical cut from his chin straight down his chest then <UNK> around his <UNK> .
"again , i took the <UNK> and pull back teh skin <UNK> the <UNK> tissue ."
"<UNK> major , <UNK> minor , and then to the <UNK> - internal and external <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> pack ) ."
i <UNK> up working on the front of the legs and the front of the arms .
damn the more i do this work the <UNK> i get .
we came back from lunch . started on the legs
i will never look at a <UNK> at <UNK> the same way again .
first we spray the body down with <UNK> to prevent mold .
the we covered the exposed muscles with wet handy <UNK> and fold the skin back over * and <UNK> the body bag back up .
* the following is a <UNK> of how we started cutting or i should say <UNK> .
"this info is from "" manual of human <UNK> "" page <#> ."
"for the <UNK> of the back , the body lies prone , with a block <UNK> the <UNK> , and the head hanging freely"
", ( we did not use a block ) so that the back of the neck is stretched ."
certain surface points should be identified before the skin is reflected .
in the <UNK> at the base of the skull the external <UNK> <UNK> .
"<UNK> , behind the lower part of the <UNK> , is the <UNK> process ."
"<UNK> between the external <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> on either side , the superior <UNK> line may be <UNK> ."
"<UNK> like of the back , teh <UNK> process of most of the <UNK> are apparent ."
the highest <UNK> spine which is <UNK> <UNK> is that of the sixth <UNK> <UNK> .
"below the last <UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> surface of the <UNK> is <UNK> , and below it , between the <UNK> , is the <UNK> ."
"identify also the <UNK> of the <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> superior <UNK> spine ."
the <UNK> part of the <UNK> <UNK> is often covered by a fairly thick layer of <UNK> fat .
running <UNK> and <UNK> from this border the spine of the <UNK> is <UNK> throughout its length .
"it ends in the broad <UNK> process , which forms the <UNK> <UNK> of the shoulder ."
"by these <UNK> , <#> large <UNK> of skin will be marked out on each side ."
these <UNK> should now all be reflected <UNK> .
the reflection of the skin will expose the superficial <UNK> of the back .
it has no specific characteristics but <UNK> the superficial <UNK> in other parts of the body .
"the <UNK> nerves of the back are <UNK> from the <UNK> primary <UNK> of the <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> <UNK> nerves ."
day <#> - get to class <#> min . early .
as i sit <#> come in who were in my other classes at d - town .
"now when i say i am nervous i do n't mean sick nervous , more like <UNK> ."
both are male . <#> died age <#> from <UNK> on <UNK> .
of this year at the age of <#> form heart failure .
"i see myself in this <#> , skinny , bald , and a big nose ."
"we opened the white body bags which have their <UNK> # , sex , date of death and cause of death written in black <UNK> ."
next the sound of the <UNK> the bag is being opened leave me alittle <UNK> at first .
next we had to turn the <UNK> over onto there <UNK> .
"once the were turned , oh had problem with his <#> arm got stuck under him , had to reach in and pull it free ."
something i was told always happens cause of the body being so stiff .
once they were on their <UNK> i lifted while the others push the body forward to get the head to hang over the end of the <UNK> .
when this happened the <UNK> ran from their nose .
a bucket comes in handy * make a note of this .
double <UNK> my hands got a <UNK> and <UNK> .
made <UNK> ( superficial ) grabbed a corner of skin and pulled back <UNK> a layer of <UNK> tissue .
* i will describe this <UNK> in detail later .
"once we cleaned teh <UNK> tissue away the muscle was exposed in the neck , back and <UNK> ."
"damn i am starving , thank god it is time for lunch ."
i hope to post a log of what i do and see
can <#> person be different on the internet and totally different in the real world ?
why is it everyone thinks i am charming and sweet on the web but in the real world i am grumpy and an ass ?
i stumbled across some other blogs and they just seemed like a cool idea .
no i do nt know the little symbols and <UNK> for words and stuff
but i 'll learn ( i hope ) .
lets <UNK> i m divorced and have <#> children and <#> step children .
which really just kind of sums my whole life up !
we did have a car - a <#> <UNK> <UNK> .
i do nt know how many miles it had on it ' cause the <UNK> stopped working at <#> .
"the gas <UNK> did nt work and since the <UNK> did nt work either it made driving very , very interesting ."
but the children were starting to get embarrassed ' cause id be covered in oil and other crap when their friends came by .
"the man at auto zone was sick of trying to explain things to me , etc ."
i finally gave it to a guy just to get him to haul it off .
getting another car would be a great idea but coming up with a down payment is nt .
ask any of them how many <UNK> they have and each will give the same answer and it does nt involve the word ' step ' .
funny thing is they all have the same father but none of them see him ( thought he only lives about <#> minutes away ) .
he is nothing more than a financial contribution in their lives .
he does say ‘ <UNK> online at times but all the kids swear after he says ‘
well i ve got to go know and take a shower ) .
my son said the last couple of times he ’s gotten on <UNK>
well dad i ve got to go and take a shower ”
ok so i know its not very nice but trust me the ‘
the children do spend lots of time with each other and to me that s all that really matters .
i do nt see much of any of the kids these days .
as a matter of fact my boss saw my youngest and <#> of her oldest sisters the other day at the grocery .
so i asked by boss how my daughters were doing ... lol .
"seems its just me , the dogs and the cat hanging out ."
the cable has nt been on for a few weeks ( that s another story ... ) and those few channels we get seem to get old really fast .
it seems that everytime i turn it on the only show i can find is method man and red .
"which is funny i must say but i keep seeing the same <#> over , and over , and over again ."
so <UNK> <UNK> ends up at the bday party doesn’t she ?
i do have a computer at home but its fried like bad chicken .
my <UNK> old has a laptop but the battery on it has gone on the blink so that s no help .
meanwhile i m paying extra every month for an additional phone line so we can be online and still use the phone .
yesterday morning when i left for work <#> children were home .
"by the time i came home from work i had a note from the oldest saying "" .... ..."
"ya mom ..... staying at .... call ya later .... """
", the middle child had already called and said "" ...."
"yeah i 'll be home sometime tomorrow .... "" and i had spoken to the youngest earlier who said "" ...."
"well no i really do nt like the <UNK> "" its summer"
she has on occasion come down and actually gotten them off their leads and put them in her basement because she said “
you have to take them outside <#> at a time and hold onto their <UNK> ‘ cause they will run away .
they did have a <UNK> which made it easier to get them outside and inside but <UNK> ate it and yes i had proof that she ate it !
i had surgery in early may so <UNK> and that kind of thing really sucks .
then when someone finally does get home the <#> of them are standing there looking all pitiful with their <UNK> hanging out a mile cause their dying of thirst .
"( ok no you should never , ever , ever , ever , ever mow the grass in sandals , flops or <UNK> ok i said <UNK> )"
and i do nt care what you say ‘ cause i know without a doubt in my mind that it <UNK> in my house someplace !
i do nt know where yet ( although i m <UNK> its under my sons bed ) but someday i m gonna find out .
i 'll bet its the place that the socks keep going .
that s it socks go there and out <UNK> miles of shirts and pants !
anymore i swear it seems like monday everyday !
if i did n't know better i think i might have even washed some of the neighbors clothes . where does it all come from .
i do n't have enough money to buy all the clothes my kids have .
must be that <UNK> thing i talked about .
<UNK> actually spent all night outside sat night !
ok but when i went outside sun morning to check on them our little escape artist <UNK> was no were to be found .
so i made will get up and walk around and try to find the little - well anyway ...
i do n't know which was worse looking for the dog or listening to will complain about it the whole time .
no he did n't get the grass cut .
i let him get away with far too much .
instead he ended up going to the movies with <UNK> and them .
its not like the grass is going to go anywhere .
sometimes i think we 'd just be better off to buy a goat and be done with it .
safe me money on gas and weed <UNK> line .
"which , by the way , i still have n't gotten ."
and i also need to look at the <UNK> to find out what kind of line .
its all just really too much for me to deal with .
he 's suppose to get the yard done today .
was suppose to do it early this morning but he has to work and the heat index is suppose to top at <#>
so i 've told him he can wait until this evening around dinner time .
i 've refused to cook dinner this summer - period !
<UNK> hung out with some friends the other day .
she wore <#> of the new <UNK> tops i bought her and did n't think to put any <UNK> on .
"she and i , unlike will and <UNK> get fried like bad chicken if we even stick our heads out during the hottest part of the day ."
she woke up sat morning ( well actually it would be sun morning ) about <#> am crying about how bad her sunburn hurt .
"me being the wonderful mother that i am said "" .... <UNK> its not that bad ..... over <UNK> ..."
"blah , blah , <UNK> "" little did i realize that the part i was looking at on her middle back was n't too bad"
but oh my goodness that part where her bathing suit <UNK> usually are ! ! !
i felt like a complete ass and even more like an ass when i realized i did n't have <#> thing in the house to put on it .
i was trying to think of what i did have and maybe i could mix something up but that just seemed stupid .
so she and i basically got up about <#> am sun morning .
she slept until about <#> am i got to walk around the neighborhood with her complaining brother looking for the # $ <UNK> dog .
<UNK> decided to grace us with her presence this weekend .
i think she 's realizing that this grown up stuff is a little harder than it seems .
i 've tried to tell her you ca n't hang out all night and work all day .
eventually it catches up with you . and lets just say it caught up with her big time .
she spent all day sat either with her head in the toilet or in a trash can .
she says she caught some kind of bug .
i think she finally decided to try having a drink and it kicked her butt .
<UNK> is the ' good child ' in the family so it was really pretty funny ( i know
she kept wanting to eat something and have something to drink and i kept trying to tell her .
""" no do n't eat anything ... "" then it was "" ...."
"i told you not to eat anything "" ."
i guess its a bad feeling to be sick to your stomach and be a <UNK> and have to sit in the <UNK> sun all day .
i stumbled across some other blogs and they just seemed like a cool idea .
no i do nt know the little symbols and <UNK> for words and stuff

"a lot of people ask me "" why are you in film ? "" and usually i say "" how did you get this number ?"
"seriously though , to answer that question , simple i love it ."
"they say the army is the <UNK> job you 'll ever love , i think the same thing about film ."
"see , a lot of folks think film is just the <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"red <UNK> , hanging out with movie stars , the <UNK> ."
well that 's about <#> % of what goes into making a movie .
let me tell you about being a pa on a film .
"you 're the first person on the set , and the last <#> to leave ."
"it 's a "" <UNK> "" position , but it 's so much more , especially on an indie film , where everything is "" do it yourself "" ."
"i could go on , but having lived through dozens of films , it 's almost impossible to explain ."
<#> of my first jobs was working on a movie called above freezing in <#> .
"it was a blast , <#> hour day minimum ( usually i <UNK> close to about <#> hours a day for that shoot ) , <#> day weeks ."
a <#> dollar a week check for <#> weeks work .
"do the math , it 's not much , after taxes even less ."
but you know what i also got for my hard work ?
"i wo n't go into heavy detail , but let 's just say the film sucked ass ."
"it was <UNK> , badly written , some of the acting is even worse ."
"the director cast his wife in the lead role , and she had the acting ability that was akin to that of <UNK> porn ."
not to mention that the film was horribly produced .
"not my call really , the director also put up the funds to make the film ."
"problem was , he was n't talented at all ."
"basically the film would go on , and he would sit with a blank stare near a monitor ."
he did n't even call roll or cut .
i 've never quite worked around somebody who had less of a concept of what a director did than this guy .
"not only that , but he had no clue on how much the film would cost , or how much work went into making it happen ."
"sure he had the money , great , be an executive producer , leave the actual making of a movie to those who know what they 're doing ."
"that shit might work for mtv , but in the real world ..."
"i needed an ad after i decided that i hate <UNK> <#> days into the shoot , so i went out and found gary ."
"gary is this really cool young <UNK> from queens , and to be honest with you , i have n't clicked with somebody on a project like gary did ."
we both saw the problems that was going to arise before they happened .
we predicted the same things before the day started .
"he 's brilliant , and that 's not to blow my own horn , but he really knows his shit up and down ."
"on top of that , he 's an ace budget guy , can do ad work , knows <UNK> up and down and is funny as hell ."
"i asked gary to be the producer of <UNK> last week , and he said yes ."
so having him on deck right now before i 'm ready to start anything is probably the best thing to happen to my project .
"hope emailed me , she 's going to read the script ."
here 's hoping that she likes it more than the other project .
"no word from the casting director i want to work with , but it 's understandable , this is the busy season for him ."
"but come on dude , i 'm sooooooo <UNK> to see what you could come up with ."
it 's probably the hardest part of the job of making a film .
"i <UNK> it to getting a root canal , only without the benefit of <UNK> and you have other people involved , usually the ones doing the <UNK> ."
"you wo n't believe how many times i 've heard "" when you 're ready , call me . """
nobody wants to throw their own money into a film .
i 'm a producer and i 'll tell them it 's a bad investment .
they end up in various stages of <UNK> .
"there is no <#> true formula for success , especially not at the indie level ."
"i 'm <UNK> , probably to a fault ."
"scratch that , on the surface i take rejection really well , but inside it sort of makes me feel that it 's something that i 'm doing wrong ."
"you go through what seems like an endless supply of "" no "" just to get that single individual who says "" yes "" ."
right now i 'm working with my old <UNK> brother from <UNK> named tom .
i 've known him for <#> years now .
you do realize your getting older when you can date your college friends that far back .
"anyway , tom and myself were <#> of the biggest party guys at our <UNK> ."
"like really big party guys , so much so the straight - <UNK> <UNK> who also made up most of our <UNK> <UNK> us ."
mostly because we did n't really take anything in the <UNK> seriously .
"not that everybody hated us , just a lot of people ."
"tom always had a great response to those things , <#> time a dude called the cops on us for smoking in the house ."
"we almost got into a lot of trouble , i was ready to kill this dude ."
"he gathered about <#> of the "" <UNK> brothers "" and went up to this dude 's room . walked in by himself and locked the door behind him ."
he then put a <UNK> on his desk with <#> minutes running down on his desk and walked out .
"the guy thought he was joking , but he was n't ."
<#> minutes later i was picking his lock and we were in his room .
i just love to give him crap about his photo of him shaking hands with dick cheney though .
"i finished at <UNK> , then went to live in texas with my then girlfriend and go to grad school ."
"things did n't work out , i moved back to ny , then moved to the <UNK> where i <UNK> , cooked and wrote ."
", i had n't see him in about <#> years , but the second we hooked up we were like jordan and <UNK> on the court ."
"tom and i have really calmed down on the party scene , but it did n't matter ."
"he really was doing well for himself , had <UNK> himself with a lot of really important people and even went to the <UNK> christmas dinner that december ."
"okay , i 'm not a bush fan , i always thought he reminded me of a dude who was in my <UNK> ."
probably somebody i would have drank a lot with .
"that being said , i would n't want any of my <UNK> brothers being president ."
"anyway , cut to <#> years later , i 'm done with <UNK> ."
"i 'm about to begin looking around for money , and a location ."
"however , new <UNK> is a bitch of a town to shoot in ."
"about <#> years ago the <UNK> had begun to take over , and right now they own the town ."
"during the summer , the town is <UNK> , meaning it 's going to be a fucking bitch to shoot at ."
"not only that , but the unions had started coming down hard on small indie projects ."
"i 'm pro - union , being my father worked for the teacher 's union , and i understand the need for them ."
"however , they were going to cost a <UNK> to deal with ."
"i decided to check out west <UNK> , in ."
"i called tom and let him know what was up , sent him my script ."
"so much so he asked if he could help me out , or at least put some cash into the film ."
"tom knows a lot of really wealthy folks in indiana , plus he has some political <UNK> ."
he 's an attorney and great with people .
"well , i offered tom a producer 's position on the film ."
"we start looking for cash on monday , keep your fingers crossed , i know i will ."
for a year he did n't even know my name while we hung out .
"he was this really cool <UNK> guy from <UNK> , with a girlfriend from home ."
"anyway , when i was living in nyc , he needed a place to live , so i said to move on in with me in <UNK> queens ."
"he did , and we shared this really tiny room ."
"we argued a lot , mostly from me using his soap in the shower , but through it all , we remained friends ."
"in october of <#> , he got cast in this really small indie film ."
he said he had to go to maryland for <#> weeks and was getting paid a grand for his work .
"he came back <#> weeks later , totally <UNK> out , and holding a <UNK> of his work ."
it was this film where these <#> kids go into the woods and get pissed at each other ( not because of soap ) and get killed by something .
"only without any of the editing , or cool stuff that made the film ."
just a lot of footage of <#> people stuck in the woods yelling at each other .
"at the end of the film , mike looked at us with wide eyes , asking us what we thought ."
"i said simply : "" uh ... do you like ... have the money for rent dude ? """
"yes , i saw it later when it was finished , the film rocked ."
"he became famous , got married and moved to la ."
"about a year ago mike called me to let me know that he and his wonderful wife <UNK> had their first baby , a girl ."
"i was away when he called for a while , and did n't get the message until i got back , by that time it had been erased ."
now i need to get back in touch with mike
"see , my film is about <UNK> boys in an <UNK> ny college ."
mike was a <UNK> boy from an <UNK> ny college .
when we lived together we always talked about doing that project together .
"only thing was , we actually intended on going through with it , not just running our mouths ."
"now here we are <#> years later , and i 've got the perfect project for him , only problem being , i ca n't fucking find him ."
"his la numbers are no more , his cell number is no more ."
"i introduced him to danny <UNK> a few years ago , and they became friendly ."
now danny does n't know where he went either .
"the dude i wrote the lead for love courage respect for , and now i ca n't find him ."
"oh well , that 's what a casting agent is for , and i 'm about to hire <#> ( hopefully next week ) ."
"if anybody can find him , he can ."
it 's time to <UNK> him for letting him move into his really small room <#> years earlier and be in his flick .
ps : no word from hope marie yet .
it 's sort of like the purple rose of <UNK> meets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"it was a short film , that i wrote and was going to direct ."
"he rocks , and is probably the best actor whom i know personally ."
"however , i could n't find a <UNK> <UNK> ."
somebody who you could tell had a sense of grace just by looking at them .
"in general , i wanted somebody who could deal with the physical part of being in an "" action film "" , let the acting part be damned ."
"plus , i feel as the director , it 's your fault if the performances were n't too good ."
it 's your job to explain the scene in terms
"<UNK> should be able to understand , and make sure you are getting what you want in a scene ."
"i 'm really easy to get along with , and i will always let you know where you stand with me ."
"i also wrote the script , so i really knew exactly what i wanted in each scene ."
i even hired an artist friend of mine to help me come up with story boards .
"i went through utter hell to find the "" right "" actress to play the lead ."
"my creative partner eric suggested i look at some model sites , as he thought that a model might be a better choice than an actress ."
so i took a day to look around on the web .
"about <#> am that night i found , what i thought was the perfect actress ."
"she had <UNK> like geometry , probably <#> of the best , happiest smiles i 've ever seen , and her eyes were absolutely piercing ."
"not only that , but she was very "" real "" looking ."
"as in , she looks like somebody you might actually know , not a pam anderson type ."
"i could go on and on about how absolutely beautiful this woman is , but it would n't do her justice ."
let 's just say i 'm convinced that she 's a muse sent down from <UNK> or wherever .
"i contacted her , and she said she would read it , i sent her a script and then ..."
"here , i had found the perfect woman for my project , and she friggin hated it ."
"that 's okay , but i was sort of <UNK> ."
"i think i probably was a little too enthusiastic in my pursuit , and she probably has been hit on by a ton of different <UNK> on the net ."
"i 'm a <UNK> , but not in that way ."
"i am very professional in my <UNK> , especially now that i 'm working on my own projects , but still ."
"i understood , back to the drawing board ."
"anyhow , about a month later i found a woman named messy <UNK> , who , to be honest , was the character ."
"hope was perfect , but messy was <UNK> ."
messy is this really wicked awesome chick from chicago who is unique in all the best ways .
"she 's funny , she 's <UNK> , she 's feminine , she 's really hot and she has <UNK> that come in about <#> different colors ."
i even went out to chicago to meet her and her boyfriend <UNK> for lunch .
they later took me out to some really cool club .
"messy read for me , and she just <UNK> it ."
"she says she 's a sucky actress , but that woman has tons of potential ."
", she said where she liked and did n't like the dialogue and proposed changes , and she took direction well ."
"i offered her the part , she accepted , i was <UNK> ."
"so i get home to nyc , and what do i find ?"
"an email from hope , <UNK> that she had n't been able to email me for a bit because she was on the road ."
i really did n't know what to say .
"it had been a while since i heard from her , and i thought she hated the project , so i moved on ."
"i was fucking pissed . not at her , but at me ."
"okay , so she also gave me her phone number ."
"i was sick <#> football afternoon on sunday , and i decided to call hope up ."
got to leave a message and then drank some <UNK> and <UNK> out .
"about <#> hours later hope calls up , and i had no clue who it was at all ( <UNK> is cool like dat ) ."
"she was , sort of , i think she was taken back a little bit , but still ."
"i <UNK> out and tried to call her later that night , she never called me back ."
"i know that rejection is about <#> % of what this industry is about , but it sucks having to be the guy doing the <UNK> ."
"messy had already <UNK> the part , and hope was a little late on getting back to me ."
i guess i really was becoming a director .
"<UNK> , the project got <UNK> and probably wo n't get made for a while ."
"i needed the cash for my impending <UNK> with my wonderful woman karen ,"
"messy has already said yes , hope still has n't answered my email ."
i 'm going to hold out this time around and hope she emails me back .
mostly because i have a huge ego and i feel the world needs to hear what i say .
"okay , that 's not it at all ."
i 'm directing my first film ( after <#> years in the industry ) and i want a diary to look back at .
"it 's <#> of those things that is a blessing in most places , and a curse in a lot of others ."
"i met up with friends i had n't seen in a couple of years , and there was n't a thing i had forgotten about them ."
"like birthdays , family members names , family birthdays , pet names ) ."
"this was n't <UNK> to just my close group of friends from <UNK> , which <UNK> to about <#> - <#> dudes ."
"here i was a <UNK> student at <UNK> , who suddenly realized that he had a <UNK> memory ."
"oh well , maybe i should of stuck it out in pre - med , but who likes the <#> am <UNK> class on a saturday ."
"fuck it , i was a film major now ."
"anyway , a <UNK> memory does n't really exist , not on the scientific level ."
they just chalk it up as having a really good memory .
"however , play me in trivial pursuit and you 'll realize that i not only have a "" really good memory """
"the problem with memory is that it 's not only a blessing , it 's a damn curse as well ."
but that 's not why i want to write a blog .
"see , i 'm making a movie ! ! !"
<#> years making other people 's films in various <UNK> have taught me <#> thing .
"it sucked , but i was there to learn , and i took in everything i could ."
but you take the good with the bad .
"just awful films where , had it been <#> years earlier , the same "" director "" probably would have been a lawyer or a doctor ."
"sucks , i know , it 's the reality of the situation of working in indie film ."
"my father ( whom i just recently contacted after <#> years of silence , to let him know i 'm getting married ) was a nyc school teacher ."
my mother worked in real estate in <UNK> ny as well as sold her art .
my <UNK> was a gm of a very successful car <UNK> .
"i never wanted for anything , but they are n't really the people i can go to for a check for <UNK> to make my film ."
"this means making a film will be up to me , and i could n't ask for a better team mate than myself ."
"last night i got an email from hope , she 's got no time for my film ."
"yes , i said feature dancer , as in adult feature dancer ."
"i knew this going in , since she mentioned it when i was casting her from before ."
"i remember <UNK> ( my significant other ) asking me if i had a problem with that <UNK> , and"
"hope is a really pretty lady , and having her on film would have been fantastic , but i understand , not her thing ."
"i 'm not a <UNK> sort of guy as it is , and i only really want people in my film who really want to be in my film ."
"who like the script , who will take the time out to develop the characters , etc , etc ."
"hope , wherever you are , whatever you 're doing , i wish you nothing but the best , you truly are a beautiful woman ."
"speaking of <UNK> , i found <#> , audrey friggin ' <UNK> ! ! !"
"i spoke with her yesterday and she 's a really sweet girl ( not sweet as in "" cool "" , but sweet as in really sweet ) ."
i watched her film lick the star again and i 'm convinced that she is my <UNK> .
"after sending her the script , she emailed me to let me know what she 's doing now ."
she 's a <UNK> <UNK> grad who is doing a lot of theater work .
"she said in her email that if "" you thought i was good in that film , wait until you see what i can do now . """
i did n't even think of that before .
"anyway , she 's looking over the script as i write that , i really hope she <UNK> the part ."
"it 's pretty key , and i only want the best ."
"originally i wrote the part for rachel <UNK> cook , but i realize that at <UNK> , that 's an <UNK> , but who knows ."
"i think audrey is a discovery waiting to happen ( well , i give credit to ms ."
"<UNK> for discovering her , but it would be wicked awesome if my project was "" that film "" that really broke her to the big time . )"
"i saw this <UNK> actress named audrey heaven , who really had me <UNK> ."
"i normally would have skipped over the film because it was directed by <UNK> , but i did n't know it was her until the end of the film ."
"i read the script , which would have run about <#> hours , and then read the book ."
"so , i call the production company the next day , tell them who i am , and what i did"
", they had n't heard of me , but would go to talk to the producer to see what 's up , they would call me back ."
"i finally call my friend , who tells me he 's sorry , but the rights to virgin <UNK> got picked up or sold to another company , <UNK> ."
"i worked really really hard , and now it 's going to go to be directed by sophia <UNK> ."
a year or <#> later the film came out to really good reviews .
"call it sour grapes , but i ca n't bring myself to watch it ."
"nothing personal , just some sort of weird way to deal with it ."
"then when lost in translation came out , i could n't bring myself to see it as well ."
"my fiance <UNK> said it 's <#> of her favorite films , but no , too much has passed between and sophia for me to see her work ."
at that point in time i just thought she sucked .
"so then i see this short , and while i do n't really get it , i think it 's really good ."
"but the <#> thing i did notice was this actress , audrey ."
"i really think audrey is my "" allison "" for the film , my female lead ."
all the lonely people where do they all come from ?
all the lonely people where do they all belong ?
all the lonely people where do they all come from ?
all the lonely people where do they all belong ?
"all the lonely people ( ah , look at all the lonely people )"
"<UNK> go <UNK> <UNK> the noise and <UNK> , and remember what peace there may be in silence ."
as far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons .
"speak your truth quietly and clearly ; and listen to others , even the dull and the ignorant ; they too have their story ."
"avoid loud and aggressive persons , they are <UNK> to the spirit ."
"if you compare yourself with others , you may become vain and bitter ; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself ."
enjoy your <UNK> as well as your plans .
"keep interested in your own career , however humble ; it is a real possession in the changing <UNK> of time ."
neither be cynical about love ; for in the face of all <UNK> and <UNK> it is as <UNK> as the grass .
"take kindly the <UNK> of the years , <UNK> <UNK> the things of youth ."
<UNK> strength of spirit to shield you in sudden <UNK> .
"beyond a <UNK> discipline , be gentle with yourself ."
"with all its <UNK> , <UNK> , and broken dreams , it is still a beautiful world ."
"such truths should arrive loudly with <UNK> <UNK> and crashing thunder . or as <UNK> , creeping cold with icy <UNK> licking to numb my core ."
then i could cover my ears or with <UNK> and steel strike a hopeful spark .
what can i do in a room so full of empty the <UNK> have <UNK> ?
"i have never smoked , but i have lived with <UNK> for most of my life ."
"several times , i have held a lit cigarette in my hand and considered taking up the habit , but i have never taken <#> consecutive <UNK> ."
"when i look at my hand holding a cigarette , it seems like someone else 's hand ."
"there is much i envy about smoking , though ."
"there is an automatic sense of something in common when <#> <UNK> come together , even if they share nothing else ."
"simply offering a light is a form of communication , an expression of some basic acceptance and understanding ."
"a group of strangers can stand around outside and smoke together , saying very little and still feel as if they have shared an experience with <#> another ."
i feel like asking why he ca n't just hand her the book of matches .
an elaborate lighting up ritual can buy a person a lot of time .
"naturally he can not be expected to respond until that first drag has been completely <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"meanwhile , we non - <UNK> run the risk of being considered <UNK> if we do n't reply immediately to another 's <UNK> or suggestion ."
i have no sugar packets to open or spoon to stir ' round and ' round as i gaze <UNK> into the swirling liquid .
"some <UNK> the <UNK> they feel to the chemicals included in tobacco , while others say it is the rhythm of it , the physical comfort of it ."
i dealt with this whole mess without benefit of any such stress - <UNK> tool .
"imagine what i feel like ! """
i have often felt separated from my partner by his smoking .
"while smoking and staring off into space , he seems complete , needing nothing from me ."
"sometimes i wish i was the cigarette , <UNK> so <UNK> in his hand ."
"though he knew there were women who dismissed him the instant they saw him light up , because they could not imagine kissing him . """
so i read those words to my partner last night to see if he would consider them an apt description of the way it is to smoke .
he told me that often that he smokes instead of talking to me and that it is easier to smoke than to talk .
"in other words , smoking requires less of him . looking back over the relationships i 've had with <UNK> -- all of them long and important ones ,"
<UNK> that have shaped me as a person -- i found both her words and his extremely interesting .
why do i seem to <UNK> toward men who smoke ?
and why has my response to their smoking never been to take it up myself ?
why have n't i chosen to fill my huge internal space with the same thing ?
god knows i 've a lifetime of examples to <UNK> .
is it possible i 've filled it with nothing ?
is it possible i am just all emptiness inside ?
none of the <UNK> in my life has ever suggested that i join him in his habit .
"i have always thought they were concerned for my health , or maybe that they did n't like the way it looked on someone else ."
but lately i 've been thinking something new .
what if they do n't want me to smoke because they do n't want me to be filled up the way they are ?
what if they understand on some level that if i were to smoke i would be less emotionally available to them ?
and i have never been the type to refuse to buy cigarettes on the theory that to do so is to aid and <UNK> another 's destruction .
i allow people to smoke in my home and in my car .
my attitude has always been that i value the person and want that person to comfortable when in my company .
i have never <UNK> a person as a potential friend because of smoking .
being around a <UNK> does n't bother me .
"but now , in light of this new perspective , i find myself thinking about it somewhat differently ."
what if the emotional distance i feel from my partner is caused because he smokes ?
will he ever be able to ( or choose to ) make more internal space for me ?
"if smoking fills him up inside , will there ever be room for me ?"
"its arms and legs are yours and so i sit a while , <UNK> the embrace , public in its privacy ."
"sunlight finds the shoulder still <UNK> with your breath and my skin <UNK> , alive in <UNK> ."
i want no more things to bind me ! all this stuff much too <UNK> defining me ! wife .
<#> day soon i will just go wild from knowing i can not get free .
i want to listen to the sea ... to catch my thoughts in poetry and vent my fury when its <UNK> .
"i want to wander endlessly , <UNK> at eternity ."
"i want to lose myself , <UNK> by that which was before <UNK> ."
strength to share hope flies all around and through me .
"it 's magic in the air : more real than wishes made for free , or even <UNK> prayer ."
"hope shows us how we long to be : dancing the way we dare , our souls as open as the sea , released from needless care ."
"no way to prove what you ca n't see , believing makes it there , flying all around and through me , giving me strength to share ."
"often , of course , the situation is too tough for him ."
in the same way the human struggles with his environment and with the <UNK> that catch him .
sometimes he masters his difficulties ; sometimes they are too <UNK> for him .
his struggles are all that the world sees and it naturally <UNK> them .
"it is hard for a free fish to understand what is happening to a hooked <#> . """
i 've been an off <UNK> again addict of beef <UNK> rice a <UNK> for the better part of <#> years now .
"upon the initial stages of my addiction , the product used to come in a can ."
"it was my everything , i 'd eat that <UNK> for months on end , then the problem ."
", i grew up on hot dogs and <UNK> and pizza ."
"now at age <#> , i have n't progressed much in the food department ."
i still eat like a <#> year old boy .
"i wo n't eat onions , i ca n't eat <UNK> , pretty much if its good for me i ca n't eat it ."
i have to use a <UNK> to strain the <UNK> and collect the carrots before i can cook it to eat .
i 've written to the company to ask if they could stop adding the carrots .
of course they sent me a note saying due to the demand for the carrots they could not help me .
"sometimes it sucks being me , i almost feel like i 'm stuck between a normal reality and a <UNK> reality that is within my head ."
"read this question , come up with an answer and then scroll down to the bottom for the result ."
"a woman , while at the funeral of her own mother , met this guy whom she <UNK> know ."
"she thought this guy was amazing , so much her dream guy <UNK> him to be just that !"
"she fell in love with him right there , but never asked for his number and could not find him ."
a few days later she killed her sister .
question : what is her <UNK> in killing her sister ?
this was <UNK> by a famous american <UNK> used to test if <#> has the <UNK> as a killer .
many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question correctly .
"if you did n't answer the question correctly , good for you ."
"if you got the answer correct , please let do n't let us know ."
last winter i decided to take another bike tour .
a friend decided he could manage the time off from work so we cut the trip down in time
landing in <UNK> we put our bikes together and headed towards town .
from the airport we ended up riding about <#> miles into the centre ' .
i had arranged a place to stay on the <UNK> river .
"after getting all set up we headed to a coffee shop , first things first !"
we were able to catch a canal tour our first evening there and it was spectacular .
walking back to our place i suggested going to the red light district .
i had read so many books with the district being described and i wanted to check it out .
before i could realize what was happening ; we were in the red light district .
"we did the tourist things , <UNK> , anne frank house tour , shopping and sight seeing ."
"the streets had the faint <UNK> of weed , beer and sweat ."
it was an international holiday and so many <UNK> were traveling for the long weekend .
we packed up our <UNK> and headed to the train station to leave for switzerland .
i had booked a train so we could sleep on the train that night .
arriving in switzerland around <#> am we were able to find a good place to stay and it was across from a bike shop .
i was going to need to switch out my clips on my shoes because i forgot to set them for my <UNK> <UNK> converted <UNK> bike <UNK> .
"good sights , good food and a great nights rest ."
"he instantly became our friend and <UNK> out our route city by city , town by town on our map ."
we headed towards st <UNK> where the <UNK> <UNK> is located .
"the ride was <UNK> challenging due to the traffic , road construction and heavy rains ."
we road <#> miles and passed into france .
once we entered into france the sun came out and we climbed gradually through rolling towns until we to our last pass .
the next <#> miles were all down hill .
quite cold we dropped into a town called <UNK> .
this town was something from the <#> 's .
it 's tiny roads led us through so many <UNK> stone roads and homes .
we took a road out to a local camping .
the rain became steadily harder so we were ready to call it a day .
at the camping a old white headed french woman ran out of the main cabin .
she insisted in french that we stay in her small trailer not in our tent .
but for <#> <UNK> i got a dry roof and room to move around .
we changed and headed to town to eat a <UNK> <UNK> .
"my travelling partner was not use to eating so heavily , it was very interesting food in northern france ."
we rode about <#> miles untill we came to a town called <UNK> .
this is where i am about <#> % sure we saw lance armstrong on a round about .
"our friends have put doubt in our heads but if it was n't him , the postal clothes wearing <UNK> sure looked like a freshly head shaved lance ."
"he looked directly at me from <#> feet away and <UNK> american . """
we rode another <#> miles through <UNK> thinking we were going to eat and sleep in <UNK> . we thought <UNK>
. we had another <#> miles to ride and it was all up hill .
we made it to <UNK> to the center of town .
<UNK> was the hotel and the owner agreed that the bikes could be parked in the side lobby .
he insisted we eat right away since he knew how tired and hungry we were but also because the kitchen was closing .
"of course we ate bread and drank wine but the main dish was fish , veggies and <UNK> <UNK> like grain ."
the dessert put me over the edge and we slept through the night .
that morning we <UNK> to loud noises all around us .
we opened our windows and the once quiet town was rocking with activity .
the circus de paris was coming through the center of town !
we rode <#> miles into <UNK> and the weather beat us down .
more climbing into the head winds and the rain picked up again .
both of us decided to go shopping in a really cool town .
that evening we ate early and got more sleep .
the next morning we rode <#> miles through some great towns .
the <UNK> were out and the <UNK> were so beautiful .
we decided after looking at the <UNK> and a map that we would catch a train in <UNK> and head towards the coast to warmer weather .
we had to sneak our bikes on the train .
apparently the ticket person sold me the wrong tickets for our bikes but it was the last train we could get on that day .
i became friends with the ticket guy on the train and he worked it out for us and even gave us a cabin so we could sleep .
sneaking bikes on a train is not too easy .
so we found a hotel and i ate at mcdonalds .
it felt disgusting but my body was craving fat .
"not spending much time in <UNK> , it reminded me of nyc before <UNK> was <UNK> ."
it smelled like a <UNK> but it was historic and beautiful none the less .
we rode <#> miles towards nice and the <UNK> riding was already proving its challenges .
climbing up out of the towns and out around the <UNK> .
i was digging the <UNK> weather and the view of the <UNK> was perfect !
i crashed a few times because of the sidewalk riding .
the wall next to us was about <#> inch from my <UNK> and the drop off on the <UNK> was about <#> feet .
both of these port cities <UNK> with so much history and <#> dollar boats .
we decided to go on into italy that evening .
as the sun set we crossed the italian border .
we stayed in a great place on the beach .
we went on a night hike across the <UNK> up to this castle .
the food on the coast was much easier to ride on than the heavier food up north .
i fell in love with the seafood <UNK> .
"we rode on through san <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
we got closer to rome and rode our way straight up to the <UNK> and old rome .
we found a place in town and headed out to an early dinner and some shopping .
the next morning my friend awoke with flu like symptoms and unfortunately spent the next several days in bed .
i was able to tour the city and catch the history .
"in the evenings i would find amazing places to eat , drink and read ."
it was interesting to see the political <UNK> about bush .
politics did n't pose itself as an issue on this trip .
most folks felt badly that we were at this <UNK> mercy .
"do n't worry they still love <UNK> , what it stands for and the people ."
i only had <#> run in with a <UNK> wheelchair bound man in switzerland .
he was french and asking me for direction .
with my little knowledge of french he basically called me a nasty american .
so we packed our bags and headed to the train station .
it was as easy this time and we were not allowed on the train .
my friend was still really sick and we had to ride <#> miles to another town to jump a train towards <UNK> .
once we arrived we were suppose to have boxes at the airport for our bikes .
i had arranged this prior to our arrival .
the airport staff sent us to <UNK> a few miles away .
we headed to the airport with our boxes and bags and slept on the floor upon our <UNK> .
the next morning we realized we were a day early .
"our newly found friends at <UNK> had <UNK> ear full from me about the flight over , the boxes and the service in general"
we got our flight changes and we loaded the plane .
the flight home seemed quicker that the flight over .
a sleeping pill goes a long way on a long flight !
"i was a child , searching for the flower buried so far beneath ."
"the <UNK> soft , the color <UNK> and complex flowing into clear simplicity ."
"<UNK> , i searched with <UNK> hope and determination , my playful mind <UNK> moving forward ."
there was nothing behind me to cause me to stumble .
"i kept digging with my bare hands , small delicate fingers strong and taught against the force ."
"i am an adult , hands weak and fingers raw ."
"the flower has turned to stone , the color gray and cold ."
"there is a web of pain before me , i am unable to free myself of it 's grasp ."
her limbs moved easily and felt every sensation .
she could smell the wind and taste the rain .
"she could hear people walking with a quick <UNK> , or <UNK> enjoying their short time in the sunshine ."
"she could feel the <UNK> of the busy traffic and see red , green , and silver cars and trucks <UNK> by ."
<UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> in bright <UNK> and space age <UNK> .
"the sky was sometimes gray and <UNK> , sometimes a swift wind pushed <UNK> of clouds across the sky ."
the nights were soft and <UNK> it was so peaceful to be alone in this quiet arena .
"the stars shown <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> ."
"the wind <UNK> to a bare whisper , which <UNK> her to sleep ."
she <UNK> time with strength and <UNK> <UNK> .
"years passed , and the world changed so slowly it <UNK> barely <UNK> ."
she <UNK> the changed in herself long before her surroundings .
her limbs <UNK> increasingly heavy as the cold winter wind was pushed away by the warm <UNK> of spring .
"the trees burst into glorious bloom , but her eyes saw their color <UNK> and their shape faint ."
she had trouble <UNK> and raising her hand to clear her eyes .
it was strange that it was so difficult to lift her hand to welcome her friend the <UNK> for a rest .
"the cars and <UNK> rushed by with <UNK> speed , making her feel <UNK> ."
"the sky seemed always to be filled with thick white clouds , which turned dark and gray on the horizon ."
where were all the people she had seen so many times before ?
she could n't feel the life around her .
she wanted to walk away to see if the sensation and life would return to her body .
her legs were filled with lead and fatigue .
with much difficulty she lowered her eyes to see herself .
"the reign of conventional <UNK> <UNK> will soon be coming to an end , and the hottest candidate for the throne is the <UNK> wave <UNK> ."
<UNK> <UNK> has been around since the early <UNK> and came into full force a decade later as the technology became better understood and the components more <UNK> .
"over the years , the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has become smarter , more <UNK> , slightly more efficient and <UNK> in digital languages ."
"some are even clever enough to talk back to you , but the truth is , the basic operating principle has remained the same for <#> years ."
"properly designed <UNK> <UNK> can provide beautifully smooth intensity control , and they are also very <UNK> and relatively <UNK> ."
"it also causes <UNK> in the lamp <UNK> , a phenomenon known as ‘"
"lamp <UNK> the <UNK> effects of the <UNK> may also reduce lamp life , as the <UNK> is stressed each half cycle when <UNK> at a <UNK> level ."
certain types of <UNK> geometry and <UNK> design can also <UNK> lamp sing .
the popular par lamp is particularly <UNK> to the effects of <UNK> because the <UNK> construction is <#> of the <UNK> .
"the <UNK> <UNK> not only effectively <UNK> the light from the <UNK> , but also the sound !"
"but even with good quality <UNK> , it is still possible to hear a lamp <UNK> <UNK> , particularly as the intensity is changed ."
"noise is also present at the <UNK> themselves , caused by <UNK> from winding of <UNK> ."
"often , these <UNK> are not <UNK> <UNK> and transfer to the <UNK> <UNK> ."
the world is very different now compared to when the <UNK> <UNK> was introduced .
<UNK> noise <UNK> have come into focus due to the rapidly increasing use of computers and wireless communications .
"it often contains multiple communications networks , not only to handle data among computers , but also to enable <UNK> facility management ."
"add to this the increasing use of wireless local area networks and cell phones , and it is clear that the <UNK> are getting crowded ."
we are starting to view noisy <UNK> - based <UNK> with increasing suspicion . or take any modern theatre .
"we must also address the growing importance of environmental issues , such as energy <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> are actually quite efficient , and very little gets lost in the <UNK> circuit itself ."
"but when <UNK> at anything less than full output , the <UNK> <UNK> presents a <UNK> non - <UNK> load , creating what is known as “"
"” this means that the phase <UNK> in a <UNK> system do not cancel out , as intended , but , rather , add up ."
"in the worst possible case , the neutral current can be up to <#> percent higher than any <#> phase current ."
the <UNK> also produce <UNK> noise and <UNK> in the distribution <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and can lead to <UNK> from <UNK> companies .
"in the european union , legislation is <UNK> that would require <UNK> systems to produce lower <UNK> levels than are currently possible with <UNK> <UNK> ."
<UNK> <UNK> in an electrical system cause <UNK> with other equipment and also represent non - <UNK> power consumption .
capital costs exist because the electrical system for a traditional <UNK> installation has to <UNK> a <UNK> power component ( <UNK> <UNK> ) .
additional running costs are represented by charges for <UNK> power ( var ) that is drawn from the main supply but not used .
"the usual rule of thumb is to <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> infrastructure , <UNK> , <UNK> , and such by approximately <#> percent ."
"that means more <UNK> <UNK> and bigger , more expensive <UNK> ."
"in some cases , the load will perform badly ; in other cases , the load and the <UNK> may <UNK> permanent damage ."
many people <UNK> consider an <UNK> <UNK> “ at full ” to be the equivalent of a non - <UNK> outlet .
the <UNK> is a <UNK> that is fast replacing both regular <UNK> and the trusted <UNK> in many power control applications .
they are significantly more efficient and easier to control than most other power <UNK> .
"<UNK> are commonly available with ratings up to <#> <UNK> and about <#> <UNK> , making them suitable for use in just about any <UNK> application <UNK> ."
reverse phase control the first attempts to use the <UNK> in lighting <UNK> employed a principle known as reverse phase control ( <UNK> ) .
"here , the <UNK> effectively <UNK> both the <UNK> and the choke ."
<UNK> <UNK> applies the <UNK> to the load at <#> <UNK> and turns it off once the desired <UNK> has been reached .
they work well for <UNK> loads or electronic low - <UNK> <UNK> but are <UNK> with <UNK> loads .
"neon , <UNK> loads , fans , and small electric <UNK> will generate destructive <UNK> <UNK> energy when <UNK> by an <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> either should not be used with these loads , or should switch to forward - phase control ( <UNK> ) to dim such loads ."
"in both cases , <UNK> or <UNK> , the <UNK> are producing <UNK> <UNK> ."
"this is a relatively new technology , but there are already thousands of channels in daily operation ."
"<#> of the largest <UNK> of <UNK> wave <UNK> is the <UNK> opera , also known as het <UNK> ."
"this <UNK> <UNK> recently installed over <#> channels of <UNK> wave <UNK> , <UNK> by <UNK> of holland ."
"other major european <UNK> of <UNK> wave <UNK> include several stages of the national theatre complex in london , england , and the <UNK> theatre in <UNK> , germany ."
how it works a <UNK> wave <UNK> can best be described as an electronic <UNK> .
the output is a <UNK> wave with continuously <UNK> <UNK> .
"the <UNK> ( <UNK> ) of the <UNK> wave is very small , typically <#> - <#> % ."
"<UNK> wave <UNK> is really a <UNK> , as this kind of <UNK> will output whatever <UNK> supplies it ."
"feed this <UNK> with a square wave , and the output will be a square wave , too ."
"“ <UNK> <UNK> by means of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ” is a better description , but that hardly <UNK> as a marketing <UNK> hence , “"
"this sounds simple but requires very precise control of the <UNK> and constant <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> to ensure reliable operation . in a <UNK> wave <UNK>"
", the <UNK> ’s are being used as a fast <UNK> , and the losses are much smaller than in <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> using <UNK> ’s ."
"<UNK> wave <UNK> are almost as efficient as <UNK> <UNK> , around <#> % at <UNK> and <#> % at <UNK> ."
<UNK> wave <UNK> practically <UNK> the main problems of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> : noise and <UNK> .
the advanced technology of <UNK> wave <UNK> makes it possible to offer many new and useful functions and features on <UNK> .
circuit <UNK> are <UNK> in order to <UNK> with electrical regulations but should only trip in case of serious <UNK> .
complete silence the most frequently discussed advantage of <UNK> wave <UNK> is the complete lack of <UNK> noise or “ lamp sing ” .
"it may seem <UNK> , but even <UNK> noisy <UNK> are absolutely silent when driven by a <UNK> wave <UNK> ."
"a few rare exceptions exist , but those <UNK> would <UNK> when <UNK> straight into the wall , too !"
"not only is the noise from the <UNK> <UNK> , but the <UNK> themselves are also quiet ."
"this allows greater freedom of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the extent of adding <UNK> , if required ."
"it may be argued that the best <UNK> <UNK> are “ good enough , ”"
but wouldn’t we prefer total silence to a little bit of noise ?
"newly designed concert halls are <UNK> with very low noise floors , and still , the best <UNK> <UNK> may not be quiet enough ."
"<UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> greatly with the quality of the power <UNK> ."
"by nature of its design , <UNK> wave <UNK> easily <UNK> poor power conditions and <UNK> generator supplies ."
"<#> <UNK> feeds them all if you want to plug a low <UNK> load into an <UNK> <UNK> outlet , you will need a <UNK> ."
"<UNK> cost money , take up space and , like <UNK> filter <UNK> , create an <UNK> noise when <UNK> to phase - control <UNK> ."
"with <UNK> wave <UNK> , any channel can be a non - dim with the added bonus of automatic <UNK> <UNK> , without any negative effects ."
"the output is always a true , <UNK> <UNK> wave . and"
"even if the channel is accidentally <UNK> , the supply is still a true <UNK> wave and should not permanently harm the equipment ."
"with <UNK> wave <UNK> , the <UNK> can often replace your <UNK> ( provided that the current capacity is sufficient ) ."
"hey , <UNK> wave <UNK> <UNK> that , too ."
"the money matters true , <UNK> wave <UNK> are more expensive than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , a lot more expensive , in some cases ."
"right now , the market is dominated by a small number of specialist <UNK> like <UNK> , <UNK> - electronic , and <UNK> ."
"once that happens , the prices are bound to drop ."
"but looking beyond the initial capital <UNK> of buying a <UNK> wave <UNK> system , there are several advantages that can <UNK> the higher cost ."
charges for <UNK> power ( var ) that is drawn from the supply but not used are also <UNK> from <UNK> costs .
"unfortunately , installation and <UNK> <UNK> are often separate , so the total cost of ownership and operation is not always obvious using conventional methods of comparison ."
"at <UNK> where <UNK> wave <UNK> has replaced <UNK> <UNK> , there is some indication that the lamp replacement is less frequent than before ."
"this makes sense , as the completely smooth <UNK> of <UNK> wave <UNK> causes much less stress than the sharp edges of the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"green <UNK> as mentioned earlier , <UNK> wave <UNK> saves on electricity and electrical infrastructure , <UNK> environmental stress ."
"in some cases , such as the het <UNK> in <UNK> , the energy - saving aspect has been recognized by the dutch government through an energy <UNK> grant ."
"in closing , i will stick my neck out to say that the days of <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> ."
"like the <UNK> , they are unable to adapt to the changing environment ."
"<UNK> wave <UNK> technology not only <UNK> the problems of <UNK> <UNK> , it also offers new and useful functions ."
"existing <UNK> of conventional <UNK> <UNK> will certainly remain for a long time , but any new installation should definitely consider <UNK> wave <UNK> ."
the advantages are just too great to ignore .
<UNK> of <UNK> wave <UNK> products and systems : <UNK> ( international electronic services )
"urllink <UNK> here are a couple of the nice comments on the article that i have received : "" i thought it was good , and incredibly <UNK> ."
"you had the technical points correct , and the coverage was good ."
it was also good to see a new face writing for <UNK> !
"we will struggle to remember what an <UNK> <UNK> was in <#> - <#> years . """
"if only all technical articles on theatre technology were so well <UNK> , we 'd all be much better educated "" ."
"i feel like <UNK> in the wizard of oz ! except that instead of a tornado , the state department has come to <UNK> my life ."
my <UNK> mother was an <UNK> for many years and retired in <#> .
"i never lived with her overseas but the kids and i did get to visit <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
she was always after me to take the <UNK> so i did twice in the early <#> 's .
so i thought it was n't meant to be .
i became the teacher i always dreamed of being .
he wanted me to take the <UNK> with him for moral support .
i went to <UNK> the first time in <UNK> and only scored a <#> .
"my son and i , along with another son had already signed up to take the <UNK> again ."
this time i did <UNK> in july and received a <#> .
took forever to get my <UNK> through but then i made the register .
i was offered the june a- <#> class but had the last class of my master 's to finish
"that has been the <#> dollar question ! or in the case of the <UNK> , maybe the <#> dollar question ."
"do i want to leave my kids , have my husband leave his career , just to try something i may not like ?"
i have gone forward and taken all the steps but i still have days of doubt .
i have my first <UNK> coming on july <#> .
"my other son graduates from college in may , will i be here for it ?"
another son is getting married in the spring .
no <UNK> i will still be in the states .
what if i do n't like being gone from everyone ?
what if i ca n't stand working in a visa mill ?
is everyone else in the <UNK> having these doubts ?
i sent in all my paperwork on friday .
time to get back to sorting <#> years of <UNK> junk .
ok just a quick test entry .... more to come shortly ....
i just read this entry on another diary site by <UNK> ...
entry : : got a chance to help someone today .
"john and i were driving home from <UNK> today , it 's about <#> hours from where we live and is my home city ."
the truck in front of us lost it 's back rear wheel <UNK> and rolled a few times and then landed in the ditch .
we pulled over john got out of the car to help i just grabbed my cell phone called <#> .
a van stopped behind us and a lady and a gentleman got out .
the gentleman ran towards the truck with john and the woman helped me tell the <#> <UNK> where exactly on the highway we were .
"another guy going the other way pulled over and ran across the ditch <UNK> the road to help , he started clearing <UNK> and <UNK> to the girls ."
<#> got out by themselves and john and the other gentleman helped the driver out she was stuck .
later the guy who had been directing traffic came over and said he saw me call and thanked me for doing that .
he did n't seem to think he just acted .
i thought to myself wow my boyfriend is brave .
"however , i certainly hope i do n't have to use my cell phone for emergency purposes again any time soon ."
god created the heavens and the earth to <UNK> the truth ; let him be <UNK> above all gods .
he created human beings from a single seed ; yet human beings openly dispute with him .
"my soul cries out , <UNK> by the beauty of the <UNK> <#> ."
"as i cry by myself , night and day , beauty <UNK> before my eyes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"if i look at the clouds in the sky , i see his beauty <UNK> ; and i see him walk on the stars <UNK> my heart ."
"the self can not be pierced by weapons or burned by fire ; water can not wet it , nor can the wind dry it ."
"the self can not be pierced or burned , made wet or dry ."
"it is <UNK> and infinite , standing on the <UNK> <UNK> of eternity ."
"the self is <UNK> , beyond all thought , beyond all change . knowing this"
"so , for the sake of your tradition , you have made void the word of god ."
"while they were going , behold , some of the guard went into the city and told the chief <UNK> all that had taken place ."
"and if this comes to the governor 's ears , we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble . """
so they took the money and did as they were directed ; and this story has been spread among the jews to this day .
"now the eleven disciples went to <UNK> , to the mountain to which jesus had directed them ."
and when they saw him they <UNK> him ; but some <UNK> .
"and jesus came and said to them , "" all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me ."
religious differences play a role in many contemporary wars .
religion is too often used as a weapon to <UNK> or a tool to <UNK> violence and hatred .
friends recognize the living spirit of god as a reality that <UNK> all names and forms .
our <UNK> of <UNK> and simple manner of worship <UNK> to this .
our form of worship is open and <UNK> because we recognize that the spirit can not be contained !
we can not therefore <UNK> the possibility that the reality we worship is present under a name and form that is <UNK> to us and present in other religions .
"<UNK> <UNK> friends readily acknowledge the presence of the divine light within all , the living spirit of god present within all persons , in all times and places ."
"there is a principle which is pure , placed in the human mind , which in different places and ages <UNK> had different names ."
"it is , however , pure and proceeds from god ."
"it is deep and <UNK> , <UNK> to no forms of religion nor <UNK> from any , where the heart stands in perfect <UNK> ."
"in <UNK> this takes root and grows , of what nation <UNK> they become <UNK> in the best sense of the expression ."
"since the light is within all , we must suppose that it is reflected in others ' religions ."
this gives us a basis for deep spiritual sharing with persons of other religions .
john <UNK> this is not to say that all religions are <#> .
these give us the guidance we need in our relating to other religions .
yet we know the presence of the spirit by its fruits .
", we may be sure that the spirit is at work ."
there is no religion without some evidence of these .
william penn the religious society of friends has at its roots an <UNK> that is simultaneously christian and <UNK> .
our <UNK> of the light within is an <UNK> of a universal divine reality .
"our language , <UNK> and inspiration , however , is christian ."
how are our <UNK> and our christianity <#> sides of the same coin ?
friends have always identified the inner light with the living christ .
"christ , in <UNK> theology , is the light . . . ."
"in the final analysis , the <UNK> doctrine of the inner light is really a <UNK> <UNK> interpretation of the christian doctrine of the holy spirit ."
"for the many whose faith is an important part of their lives , this requires us to take a sincere interest in their religion ."
"<UNK> <UNK> : a. friendly discussions with members of other religions , held in a spirit of mutual respect and open <UNK> ."
c. <UNK> to other religions in <#> 's local community for joint engagement in service projects .
"d. joint youth events , especially if relations are <UNK> in local schools ."
"e. <UNK> in <UNK> that local community events are welcoming to and <UNK> of all religious , ethnic and cultural groups in the community ."
<#> of the greatest fruits of such sharing is often <#> 's own spiritual growth .
"our experience , however <UNK> , can not be but a glimpse of something infinite and <UNK> beautiful ."
this is a treasure we should not neglect .
"at the same time , friends are right to feel that we likewise have <UNK> of great value in our own tradition and experience to share with others ."
"i had a curious , curious dream last night ."
i found myself visiting a beautiful church that i’d never been to before .
"men , women , children , all ages , all races , everything ."
"there seemed to be some kind of celebration going on , and everyone was looking forward to some kind of <UNK> occasion ."
"everyone there was very friendly and nice to me , and i felt so at home there – in that building , with those people ."
i felt like i’d found a new church home .
"and i think the church was , by <UNK> , a <UNK> christian church ."
"many months ago , i had a dream <UNK> a voice said , “ in <UNK> is salvation ."
” but now i’m seeing <UNK> of a church and i’m feeling strong feelings of welcome and peace and happiness there .
is it just time in my life to do that ?
"as a living , growing being , is it that time in my life to shift and change ?"
i am watching and <UNK> a moment in my childhood .
"i could see , through the <UNK> , snow covering the ground ."
"and i could also see , sitting in the <UNK> of that protective tree , a single <UNK> , just sitting there in all his <UNK> glory ."
"somehow in that moment , with snow and bird and tree and child , there was a deep connection there of life , even in the midst of winter ."
"i suppose what i’m getting at is that the peace and <UNK> i found there , is what i’m looking for in my spiritual search now ."
"i’m thinking that once i find that , i’ll know i’ve found my spiritual home ."
"last night ’s dream <UNK> up similar <UNK> . and what else would i think , but that ’s what i want in my spiritual life ?"
by mary k. <UNK> at the very center of the <UNK> faith lies the doctrine of the inner light .
"so george fox , in his journal , is repeatedly shown <UNK> troubled <UNK> to the “ teacher within ."
"” in his long , anxious search for eternal life and peace , he found no help until he learned to listen to the inner voice ."
so basic is the article of belief that it <UNK> and explains the attitude of the friends toward many things .
"<UNK> speaking , the office of the inner light is <UNK> ."
"first , it <UNK> between good and evil , revealing the presence of both in human beings and , through its guidance , offers the alternative of choice ."
"second , it opens to human consciousness the unity of all human beings ."
the <UNK> believe that the <UNK> of evil as well as good are <UNK> in every <#> .
but <UNK> do not share the <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> god and humans .
"they feel , with <UNK> , that the idea of <UNK> or “ <UNK> ” sin is an “ invented and <UNK> <UNK> ."
", therefore , we are the <UNK> of our own destiny , having the power of choice ."
"salvation , in the <UNK> sense , lies in our power to become the children of god ."
"such a life is never static , but always in a growing frame of wisdom , “ shining more and more unto the perfect day ."
” the <UNK> sense of god ’s immediate presence is the <UNK> for a consciousness of human unity .
"believing that all people <UNK> in some measure of divine <UNK> , the friends are able to believe that where goodness is , there is god ."
so it is possible for friends to <UNK> with the <UNK> of all religious <UNK> .
"while some religious groups have <UNK> the bible as the final and finished <UNK> of spiritual <UNK> , the <UNK> believe in a “ continuing revelation ."
"baptism means an <UNK> or spiritual experience , not a ritual act ."
"communion is also of the spirit , and <UNK> no <UNK> act , being but a conscious <UNK> to all divine <UNK> ."
"through their acceptance of direct <UNK> , they have <UNK> to make of religion a way of life ."
through their individual concerns they have <UNK> <UNK> and started great movements for the <UNK> of human <UNK> .
her literary experiences include the writing of a column for a new york newspaper and working on columbia university ’s columbia <UNK> .
she was a member of <UNK> friends meeting in pennsylvania for many years until her death in <#> .
"and that to me strongly suggests that this whole business about the virgin birth and a savior and the very existence of jesus and all that , are <UNK> ."
"in other words , it 's not eternal truth ."
it 's not real in the way that a robot is n't real like a human being is .
"and quite often i do wonder if it 's possible to "" <UNK> "" it at all , given that there was nothing there to claim to begin with ."
"yes , to me its very existence is <UNK> ."
"and the human mind is perfectly capable of <UNK> a "" sacred text "" such as the bible , to answer any questions about its <UNK> ."
"i always come back to the "" consider your source "" argument ."
of course the christian church wants to maintain its status as the world 's most powerful religion .
of course they 're going to <UNK> every inch of information to maintain that position !
of course he would n't own up to whether or not he was having cyber affairs or seeking new partners online .
"he did n't want to lose me , until he had something else lined up ."
"that 's why over the last several years , i 've come to think that the <UNK> religions were more sincere ."
they do n't have a position of power to defend .
"they 're not out to win votes , as it were ."
"and this is what makes it so very , very hard for me to believe that there 's any truth at all to christianity ."
"<#> can find the same spiritual values it <UNK> in other paths that do n't have an agenda , that are n't defending its position in the world ."
"we live near snow - <UNK> mount <UNK> , the highest mountain in the canadian <UNK> ."
sometimes our problems can seem as big and as <UNK> as mount <UNK> .
take the bible story about the man whose son was very sick .
"in desperation he brought the boy to the disciples , but they were unable to cure the man 's son ."
"next , the <UNK> father <UNK> before jesus and begged for help ."
"jesus answered , "" all things can be done for the <#> who believes ."
""" the man <UNK> , asking for help that he might believe more ."
this story tells us not to look at our mountain - sized problems but to look to christ for mercy and help .
jesus ' <UNK> of the mustard seed says that even a weak faith can do gigantic things because it <UNK> us to god .
we do not have to face our mountains alone .
"today 's prayer thank you , lord jesus , for helping us with our <UNK> problems ."
remind us that we never face those problems alone .
even weak faith has great power because it <UNK> us to god .
"i found this on <UNK> : born at <UNK> on the <UNK> , <#> ; died on the <UNK> near <UNK> , <#> ; feast <#> september ."
"the family name is unknown of this great <UNK> and <UNK> , called the <UNK> of the <UNK> ."
"later writers call the saint <UNK> of <UNK> , of <UNK> , or of <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , <#> ) shows from letters and other documents that she probably belonged to the <UNK> family of <UNK> , whose <UNK> are the present <UNK> of <UNK> ."
"her father was a soldier in the service of <UNK> , count of <UNK> ."
"<UNK> was a weak and <UNK> child , and in consequence received but little education at home ."
"her parents , though much engaged in <UNK> <UNK> , had a religious <UNK> and had promised the child to the service of god ."
"she was taught to read and sing the latin <UNK> , sufficient for the chanting of the divine office , but never learned to write ."
"the life of <UNK> as child , religious , and <UNK> was an extraordinary <#> ."
"left much to herself on account of her ill health , she led an interior life , trying to make use of everything for her own <UNK> ."
from her earliest years she was <UNK> with visions .
i also wondered and during my sickness i asked <#> of my nurses whether she also saw similar things .
"when she answered no , a great fear <UNK> me ."
this condition continued to the end of her life .
"<UNK> had noticed her gifts and made them known to a monk of the <UNK> <UNK> , but , it seems , nothing was done at the time ."
when about <#> years of age <UNK> received a command to publish to the world what she saw and heard .
"she <UNK> , dreading what people might think or say , though she herself was fully convinced of the divine character of the <UNK> ."
then a monk was ordered to put in writing whatever she related ; some of her <UNK> also frequently <UNK> her .
"the writings were submitted to the bishop ( henry , <#> - <#> ) and <UNK> of <UNK> , who pronounced them as coming from god ."
the matter was also brought to the notice of eugene ii ( <#> - <#> ) who was at <UNK> in <#> .
"<UNK> of <UNK> , bishop of <UNK> , was <UNK> to investigate and made a <UNK> report ."
"these were not only from the common people , but men and women of note in church and state were drawn by <UNK> report of her wisdom and <UNK> ."
"she later founded another <UNK> , <UNK> , across the river from <UNK> ."
"she wrote music and texts to her songs , mostly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> saints and virgin mary for the holidays and feast days , and <UNK> ."
"there is some evidence that her music and moral play <UNK> <UNK> ( "" play of <UNK> "" ) were performed in her own <UNK> ."
in the <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> a young man was buried who had once been under <UNK> .
the <UNK> authorities of <UNK> demanded that she have the body removed .
she did not consider herself bound to obey since the young man had received the last <UNK> and was therefore supposed to have been <UNK> to the church .
after much worry and <UNK> she succeeded in having the <UNK> removed .
it is said that she died a holy death and was buried in the church of <UNK> .
she 's another christian female leader and <UNK> i find quite <UNK> .
"yes , i know , most mainstream christians would say , "" you need to look to christ , not <UNK> , for inspiration . """

"another said , ' i have bought <#> <UNK> of <UNK> , and i am going to try them out ; please accept my regrets . '"
"another said , ' i have just been married , and therefore i can not come . '"
so the slave returned and reported this to his master .
"for i tell you , none of those who were invited will taste my dinner . '"
""" i 'm trying to work out what this <UNK> says as well ."
sometimes taking things <#> bit at a time is a little easier .
"well , i was n't sure where i should put these thoughts , so i 'll put them here ."
"most of this relates specifically to the area of sexuality , but it does expand further than that ."
"well , a big part of it is because i felt very <UNK> from my own peers in my late high school and early college years ."
"walking as a <UNK> ( at least at first ) justified a lot of things for me , including my <UNK> into <UNK> and all ."
"i was also being <UNK> sexually <UNK> by my alcoholic <UNK> , and i did n't see why god was allowing that to happen ."
i think that event is the biggest reason i am where i am today .
"anyway , i had to get away from that home ."
"- i should n't call it a home , not when i lived in such terror there every day ."
"where mom lives , is no home to me , because i still have that fear to stay where she and her husband are ."
i was looking for something to justify my ego - driven desires .
i did find something i thought was worthwhile - goddess <UNK> .
i became very involved in the women 's <UNK> movement .
"i became a local household name in that scene , in fact ."
"oh yes , i was striving to be something or be someone ."
"so where in the hell am i going with this , and what does this have to do with my <UNK> in christianity ?"
part of this involved a lot of wide - ranging sexual <UNK> .
but i 'm coming to a point in my life where i 'm figuring out what i 'm really looking for .
"thankfully , i grew up <UNK> and i do n't have a lot of guilt associated with that kind of thing from my childhood ."
"so , i 'm a little <UNK> to move around and explore this ."
"<UNK> no <#> i know would even begin to see this ,"
"the <UNK> seemed to be a lot more concerned with treating people with compassion , especially as <UNK> in the way he handled the situation with the <UNK> ."
and they do n't even bother to sit down and really ponder why christianity has certain guidelines .
have the christian <UNK> who have studied these things for centuries wasted their efforts ?
i 'd like to find a <UNK> of woman - <UNK> <UNK> with christian attitudes of self - respect and self - control .
many <UNK> and <UNK> can accept <UNK> self - control from a zen master .
"but let it come from a christian and the view changes ; the christian is seen as being <UNK> , the zen master as enlightened ."
but i speak from a perspective of figuring out what i want in my life .
"there 's room enough here for everyone , it seems to me , in this great country ."
"dating joe opened my eyes to a lot of things , and i 'm still not settled in my mind about it all ."
there 's a lot about him i strongly admire .
he is n't afraid to color outside the lines and try new things .
"he can be an <UNK> <UNK> and is ever willing to defend freedom to explore , to learn ."
"it seems that he probably thinks that his own former religion , <UNK> , also supports learning and intellectual power ."
"he himself had planned on becoming a <UNK> priest , so that he might learn and be able to teach other young people coming up behind him ."
"his is a powerful presence , a fine mind ."
but he does n't always turn it to what i think are the most beneficial ideas .
"they are n't things i want in my world , in my life ."
"maybe in a way i 'm <UNK> a little more in the conservative direction , at least with regards to my personal life ."
perhaps i am exploring a form of a middle path ( as the buddha would call it ) .
"perhaps i see that <UNK> in either direction can be unhealthy , and i need to work out a balance in my own life ."
this is why i look for examples of female leadership in christianity .
"i often struggle with poor self - esteem , and having examples like this really helps me a lot ."
"any <UNK> worth his or her salt would say this is n't a bad thing , if it helps me feel more capable , more confident , more valuable ."

finally . and part of me wants to sing . to make a song . or a poem .

the old love songs from my early twenties still come back through my mind -- and my mouth .
but nothing <UNK> from the moments of my present experience .
i have been wondering if my lack of creative production over the past <#> or so years is connected to the <UNK> i 've been taking .

i do n't even know how to talk about my life .
it was like growing up in my own private concentration camp .
that is the <UNK> way to put it .
there was so much violence -- of so many different types -- in my family of origin .

"he is sitting on the bed with his hands down his pants , <UNK> himself ."
"all the while talking to me , looking into my face , into my eyes ."
i do n't know how many times this happened throughout my childhood .

why is n't <UNK> day a <UNK> here like <UNK> de <UNK> ?

"<UNK> play a very large part in the price of the goods , as do politicians and the senior ranking <UNK> within the ranks ."
"for the <UNK> it is a matter of keeping the money flowing to their companies , no matter the means by which this is accomplished ."
usually it means promising to build a factory or to spend large sums of money in a politician ’s district . or
the promise of a high level position to the military representative on retirement from his or her post .
"for them it means out <UNK> each other , even if it means <UNK> to low and on a <UNK> promise that is impossible ."
"they know that they can appeal for more money and time later in congress , and the politicians that work for them will vote in the <UNK> favor ."
the politicians continue to vote <UNK> of the spending because it will mean jobs for their <UNK> .
"the biggest part of the argument , jobs lost as the affect of military cuts ."
most of the <UNK> occur from <UNK> of the company not related to defense <UNK> .
there is no incentive for companies to improve the <UNK> products .
moreover it has been shown that for every <#> dollars spent on arms creates <#> jobs .
those are just jobs created from the government spending the tax money on improving itself .
the <UNK> all have a large stake in the <UNK> business .
they want to keep the <UNK> happy and are more than willing to ensure that their friends are treated well .
"they are taken care of , free of charge , at least to them , the tax <UNK> pick up the tab ."
"rides on military planes , ships , and free luxury hotel rooms are very common practice for <UNK> and their <UNK> and political friends ."
all for the sake of keeping the dollars flowing to a select few and all involved are happy and well taken care of .
for <#> it is estimated that about $ <#> <#> was spent directly and <UNK> on the <UNK> .
that is <#> % of the total estimated budget of $ <#> <UNK> in the entire budget .
the only other administration that <UNK> more of the budget is health care .
interest on the national debt is in third place at <#> % .
with the environmental protection agency and the state department come out lastly with less than <#> % each of the budget .
the united states is the biggest <UNK> when it comes down to military spending .
worldwide it takes a <#> % bite out of the combined total military spending .
"<#> times larger than the combined <UNK> of cuba , iran , <UNK> , iran , iraq , north korea , and <UNK> ."
"with that information , how can such a large budget be justified ?"
the <UNK> says it needs to keep developing better weapons to stay ahead of all our current and potential enemies .
but if they are not spending their own money on such research what weapons do we need to stay ahead of ?
"the second point if we need to be so far ahead in technology , way have we been using the same aircraft and <UNK> for the nearly <#> years ?"
"if they aren’t broke and can accomplish the goals , why replace them ?"

the best comparison is that you trade in your reliable low maintenance car for a sports car that is in the shop <#> weeks of every month .
why spend the money on something not being used ?

"growing up in central florida with plenty of lakes nearby , for a kid like me it was great ."
"<UNK> was my favorite and to this day , i have some of the best memories of my life from there ."
<UNK> had a small beach area that was a <UNK> <UNK> in piece of sand that came away from the water only about <#> feet .
at the edge of the fence the grass was always trying to <UNK> this piece of land that my young life <UNK> around .
a single <UNK> metal - framed <UNK> stand stood centered above the sand .
behind and to right side of the beach was a large <UNK> area with tall pine trees that kept the ground covered in dried pine needles and shade .
i’d get dizzy looking up into the <UNK> .
sometimes us kids <UNK> a few of the pine needles into little <UNK> and try to make the others cry and give up .
"sometimes , like it does when kids play rough , <#> of us would get mad and then there were be a <UNK> thrown blindly behind tears ."
there were covered concrete <UNK> with bar - b - que <UNK> .
"standard park <UNK> , metal box on a pole with a greasy <UNK> on top that has never been <UNK> clean of cooked <UNK> ."
nearby would always be the <UNK> <UNK> sticking <UNK> out of the ground .
water always <UNK> out wildly from it in all directions .
"farther over was a canal that ran into the lake , <UNK> from the surrounding area ."
we’d find some that were as big as our <UNK> .
"at the bottom , it was just a thin layer of loose sand and the rest was hard pack ."
"on the way up , i’d open my eyes and see the sun <UNK> through the green <UNK> of the lakes water ."
"i could hear the <UNK> of ski boats farther out , like a <UNK> under water ."
<UNK> run parallel to the shore <UNK> a <UNK> who would sometimes end the ride into the tall <UNK> of the other side of the <UNK> .
we’d <UNK> out deeper until just our heads were <UNK> and wait on the wake from the boats to push us toward shore . once in
awhile there would be a giant <UNK> <UNK> just over the waters surface looking for a forehead to land on and take a big bite .
a quick slap would take care of that <UNK> .
the <UNK> was also a place to scare us .
"it would be nothing but <UNK> , <UNK> , and big black water bugs crawling around ."
we could see small fish swimming through the grass along the sides .
"when it rained is when we had the best time , the water would rise and move fast down to the lake ."
"we would get pieces of <UNK> , boards , and even old dry <UNK> shipping <UNK> and ride the current down a length of the canal ."
usually stopping at a tunnel that ran under where the roads <UNK> .
"in addition , we never ever went into the last short part of pipe that <UNK> into the lake . here"
the mouth of the canal <UNK> and was shallow enough to walk around just ankle deep at times .
other places the volume of water flowing out to the lake cut <UNK> <UNK> in the sand .
we’d walk around on the ever - changing sand bars catching <UNK> or just exploring .
"when it was deeper , you could see bass jumping <UNK> out of the water in pursuit of <UNK> and <UNK> ."
where the pipe <UNK> from under the last street the concrete <UNK> at the bottom of the pipe was <UNK> under to form a <UNK> .
"in that little cave , under the water was the <UNK> animal of the lake ."
"he was big , <UNK> and always pissed off ."
"to my childhood memory , he had to be about the size of a car tire ."
his shell was looking <UNK> and <UNK> looking .
"closest we would come to the thing was on <UNK> that would form , <UNK> , and reform within the canal ."
"however , it was always deep right were the water poured in from the pipe ."
his head would pop up from below and <UNK> at us in pure hatred .
"that caused a lot of excitement for us , and fear ."
of course the line would always snap and we got to watch our <UNK> move around on the surface and then sink .
i imagine it had a lot of <UNK> stuck in that jaw .
i never thought much for bass fishing with the endless casting out and <UNK> back in .
i wanted to have a <UNK> set for about <#> feet deep and a real piece of <UNK> on the hook .
the summer when i was about <#> it was always with another kid named roger .
i always thought he looked like a really white version of the <UNK> big boy .
he was always up for going and i don’t think we missed a day of fishing that summer .
"this was back in the some years when there were still <UNK> in all the <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> areas ."
during a good rain at night there would be nothing but the sound of thousands of <UNK> calling to each other in the dark .
walk outside and you’d see them hopping all over the road .
the next morning there would be nothing but flat <UNK> of <UNK> that never made it back into the <UNK> .
after a couple days of summer sun beating down on the remains they became flat dried frog .
"made great weapons for a couple young boys to throw at each other , just gross enough for us to really enjoy ."
he made a great target for <UNK> the skills for frog <UNK> .
when we went to the water it was with <UNK> in hand and all our tackle in a red <UNK> wagon .
a tackle box each and an old butter bowl with holes cut into the top by a <UNK> and fresh dirt and worms inside freshly dug from <UNK> yard .
the <UNK> were ready to go as soon as we got to the water .
"our tackle boxes next to each other in middle of the wagon , the worms at the very back ."
"once we got to the lake we didn’t stop at the edge , we went right into the water , clothes and all ."
lots of tall grass sticking through the surface that we just knew hid millions of hungry fish .
the wagon came right along with us . once in the water
we <UNK> up and cast the lines away from us .
the wagon <UNK> or was getting hit from waves created by the wake of boats .
my most memorable day was while we were involved in our routine .
roger <UNK> in a good - sized <UNK> and needed help getting off the hook and onto the <UNK> .
i set my <UNK> into the wagon and let the rod itself <UNK> into the water .
just as we got done with his fish we both see my <UNK> making its way across the water under its own power .
followed by my rod pulled all the way into the water and the <UNK> metal sinking it to the bottom immediately .
the only way to find the rod was that the <UNK> was still pulling across the surface ; it still had slack in the line .
"if we didn’t get it before the fish pulled the line tight and the <UNK> disappeared , no more pole , we’d never find it ."
i was in a little more than waist deep and trying to do the water run that is all <UNK> and very little movement .
roger was a little smarter and used his rod to <UNK> my line pulling it into reach .
"between the both of us we got the rod back up , drained the water from the gear housing and started <UNK> in the fish at the other end ."
"it wasn’t a monster <UNK> but it had us excited over the way we caught it , <#> fish at the same time ."
the beach is <UNK> with warning signs of “ danger : no swimming ”
"a place that meant , means so much to me and so many other kids now adults has been reduced to just another <UNK> area no <#> can enjoy ."
part of growing up is saying goodbye to childhood .
"if anyone happens to see this , here are <#> other links : urllink <UNK>"
did anyone see that photo of john kerry on the flight deck of the space shuttle in that little bunny costume ?
"where were the ears , the pink nose and <UNK> ?"
. only in white ( of course ) .
"even funnier is the fact that after it hit the press , his camp got all <UNK> and embarrassed ."
"maybe that 's true , but it does n't take anyone else to make him look like the boob he is ."
who does kerry 's camp think they 're kidding ?
they arranged this photo - op and it <UNK> on them .
i know this is trivial but so is he and i 'm having fun with it .
"the hours will be worse , in a way ."
i previously worked noon to <#> pm and that gave me time for a bike ride almost every morning and time do those little things .
"starting august 9th , i will work 8:30 <UNK> pm ."
"it will require tremendous determination to get home , throw on the bike clothes and go ."
it 's simply out of the question to do it in the morning .
i 'm working on clearing out a file cabinet and came across the divorce <UNK> from my first marriage .
"new york state requires a reason to get divorced , <#> has to provide a definition of <UNK> differences ."
initially i started divorce <UNK> and my ex - husband decided that he needed to be the <UNK> since he did n't want to divorce .
it did n't matter to me as long as i could get the divorce .
"reading the complaint a couple of nights back really shook me , as the reasons were all about me not wanting to sleep with him ."
what scared me was the fact that i am so not interested in sleeping with m right now .
"( no , i orgasm just fine ) ?"
am i so selfish that occasional <UNK> is all i need ( maybe ) ?
my least favorite part of all this is the fact that i dislike myself right now .
"all the thoughts that literally rush in - <UNK> are a lousy wife , you are selfish , you are lazy ."
"those come in the night , there are better thoughts in the day ."
this post goes to fear and its plague in my life .
i am to meet a friend today for a bike ride .
"anything out of the ordinary , any change in routine , any <UNK> from the pre - work routine <UNK> me ."
this section is where i do my <UNK> of speed and effort and can feel the muscles burn in my ass and thighs .
"if change is what i 'm after , then let me try change and risk the rain and <UNK> road ."
"all went well and while a small <UNK> was found , the doctor feels it 's nothing to be concerned about ."
"doctor 's offices are interesting and <UNK> places , i find ."
a wave a guilt and anger crosses through me each time i have a casual conversation at my job .
"a voice always talks right behind my head -- "" get back to work , get back to work . """
i 'm taking m in for a <UNK> ( routine ) and then heading to work late .
it takes all i have to make it through a day there .
"good , smart people i work with , but the pressure and daily failure take a toll ."
there must have been a heavy rain last night .
the <UNK> i ride by on my usual bike route seem filled with water and the air is damp and <UNK> .
m ( my husband ) returned from a weekend music festival late last evening .
the entire weekend was mine to do with as i pleased and i decided to slow down and rest .
instead i took the dog to the ice cream <UNK> .
she enjoyed her vanilla cone and then promptly threw it up .
"chocolate peanut butter with coconut <UNK> delight in a <UNK> cone was my treat , which i did not throw up ."
"a long conversation with a friend came next , talk of marriage , bike riding , family --- i ca n't say how these conversations help me ."
"a nap in the <UNK> came next , after reading several chapters of the wheel of time by robert jordan ."
no thanks <#> times and the dog giving her <UNK> opinion the whole time .
"all of a sudden , i 'm shy ."
i also hope to keep friends posted on the <UNK> on in my life .
my poor husband bears the <UNK> of all my dismay and perhaps i can ease that burden by writing here .
"gosh , this makes my life sound so miserable ."
"the standard laundry list of a satisfied soul , sounds like , but i only feel satisfied in my own home ."
"<UNK> by my books , fabric , garden and people ."
"it 's my job that brings misery . or that i let bring me misery , to be precise ."
"coming on my <UNK> birthday , as i will be in <#> years , i 've been thinking about where i 'd like to be then ."
"so i am here , thinking out loud and seeing what this will bring , this blog ."
my grandmother died a few years ago and my mother had a stack of her love letters .
"my grandmother 's second husband ( my mother 's father ) had written them and they were beautiful , <UNK> , and a treasure ."
"ever since reading those , i 've often thought what a sadness that a life would not have a record ."
"<UNK> in life have always <UNK> me up , making me <UNK> my goals and what 's important ."
the job i 'd taken proved to be <UNK> with very little pay .
i did it well and was able to deposit $ <#> a week into my bank account .
"not bad , considering that i had no income before ."
"still , i was tired of living in <UNK> rooms in and around l.a ."
", dealing with people ten years my junior , and performing <UNK> work that kept me on my feet all day ."
i 'd taken my home <UNK> course on <UNK> with me and managed to complete the first assignment .
"after that , exhaustion and defeat took over ."
"i found myself at <#> of the lower points in my life , feeling like a <UNK> failure ."
i 'd told my husband as much when he called me .
the crew i worked with invited me out to dinner and <UNK> .
i jumped at the chance because i was beginning to climb the walls in my room .
<#> couple having sex with their clothes on up on the stage while <UNK> music <UNK> the crowd .
i found myself up on stage dancing by myself .
i think i shocked my crew because they were still talking about it <#> weeks later .
"but it was something that i needed , apparently , because i began to feel better ."
"i was able to go home for thanksgiving , but had to fly up to washington state and then out to phoenix ."
"i decided to take my <UNK> with me , which weighed a ton in my carry - on bag ."
"my novel is set in the <UNK> , west of phoenix , so i was excited about going on this trip ."
"i <UNK> a chapter and went <UNK> to <UNK> , a small town <#> miles <UNK> of phoenix ."
that trip was the highlight of my road job .
", where i received the news that we may be working up to christmas eve ."
"so i went . luckily , the manager needed a secretary ."
i would be working by myself for <#> hours a day while everyone was on the road .
the office was so quiet it was almost <UNK> .
this was my chance to study my <UNK> course .
"i not only studied <UNK> , but returned to my study of internet marketing , where i studied the sales letters of the con artists versus the legitimate <UNK> ."
i had <#> question on my mind : can i use their techniques to sell my book once it 's finished and published ?
hundreds of writers are using this service to find <UNK> work .
a few have made quite a success at it .
"i thought i would give it a try , despite the <UNK> registration fee ."
the first thing i did was check the profiles and <UNK> of my competition .
most of them had bs degrees in english and impressive <UNK> .
"i have an as in computer graphics , <#> published short story , my <UNK> that did n't get a great reception , and an <UNK> novel ."
"thanks to my experience in hr , i managed to land a $ <#> resume assignment within a month and got a <UNK> review to boot !"
i posted more <UNK> for projects that i felt i was qualified to do .
"a few <UNK> asked for samples ( which i did n't have ) , but most ignored me for the more experienced <UNK> ."
"the day after i got my new ipod , apple <UNK> a new version - typical !"
they dropped the <UNK> version and knocked $ <UNK> off the price with longer battery life too .
"just my luck , but i do nt care i like mine a lot ."
"got a new <UNK> over the weekend , an <UNK> ipod and its brilliant ."
"loaded almost my entire music collection onto it , and there 's still <UNK> free space left ."
i love shoot - em - up games and my <UNK> game at the moment is <UNK> enemy territory .
had been <UNK> dust in the back room and was about to be <UNK> into the rubbish skip .
"well i thought is was too good to miss and ended up taking it home , hoping to sell for few bucks ."
<UNK> up your index page and make sure your assignment list includes the following assignments :
"for adults or children ? ] , which rides , <UNK> , games , entertainment you would include , season length ."
<#> ) why your theme park would survive in that area and with that theme .
essentially you want to compare your proposed park to entertainment competition in your chosen area .
remember to discuss challenges and proposed solutions of that area .
"keep in mind physical resources in the area you choose ; cost of living ; population <UNK> , growth , and <UNK> ; weather patterns ; transportation access ."
"you will present this information in a <#> - <#> minute <UNK> presentation on wed , aug <#> ."
after your presentation you will turn in the <UNK> report to me .
post questions about this assignment in the comments section .
", i got up and put on a shirt that i had no business wearing in public ."
so i went out to run some errands and i stopped at my favorite cafe .
i had some lunch and then made my second mistake .
"i thought it would be smart to take a short cut back to my car through the long , <UNK> , back alley .... in downtown detroit !"
"i had no means of defense on me , not even a phone ."
"i pass by a <UNK> looking man with a beard , a cap , and sunglasses creeping around by the <UNK> ."
"my eyes were fixed on the the blade , dreading what he might do with it ."
"he held the knife at my belly and began edge the blade toward my vulnerable , bare mid - section ."
"he held the knife still , nearly touching my stomach ."
then he pulled a hand gun from his back pocket and aimed it right at my nose .
i handed him the purse and he put down the gun and the knife .
he took the cash and credit cards out of my wallet then pressed the hand gun firmly into my belly button .
i turned them inside out to clarify i had nothing else .
he put the gun away and ran off with my <UNK> .
"just to be safe , i stayed at my mom 's house until a few months later when they caught the guy ."
"as much shame as i feel in sharing this story , i hope it will be learned from ."
"so if you do n't want to be <UNK> or have your belly <UNK> , do n't take back <UNK> alone and wear shirts that fit ."
we 've finished <#> out of <#> days of our <UNK> class .
"there are about <#> people in our class , a lot of really , really good people ."
"finally , i walked into a room and for the first time , i felt like the baby in the group ."
"it 's been <UNK> , the combined energy just <UNK> everyone up several levels ."
i suspect we 're weeks to even months ahead of where we would be had we been working alone .
"prior to class , i quit most other forms of healthcare maintenance i was doing , except <UNK> ."
( the things i do in the name of research ! )
i 'd mixed so many different <UNK> that when my health improved it was impossible to tell which <UNK> or <UNK> were responsible for the improvement .
"but i honestly did n't know if <UNK> therapy alone was sufficient , and i wanted to find that out this weekend ."
prior to class i knew enough to start practicing on myself .
i tried and tried and tried to <UNK> my own <UNK> <UNK> .
"i 'd seen articles <UNK> the idea of <UNK> <UNK> because when they did tests , <UNK> could n't seem to agree on the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"first day we got in there , and luckily with the background work i did , i could at least admit i felt something . and"
"surprisingly , about <#> % of the class felt something ."
"most of my classmates are , at this point , suffering from information <UNK> ."
but i admit i 'm probably driving the instructor <UNK> .
":p she most likely thinks i 'm not listening to her while she talks , but i am . and"
reading the notes is challenging enough ; having to solve a <UNK> before reading the notes - no way .
"my first day was a challenge ; at our school we got a good foundation in the basics of massage , but nothing out there like energy work ."
"my partner was a student at <UNK> , a school in safety harbor where they apparently teach you a little of everything ."
"so her main strength was energy , but not really massage , so she did n't have good body <UNK> ."
"as soon as she leaned over me and started working on my throat area , i felt <UNK> and had an immediate , full blown emotional reaction ."
"it sent me back in time <#> years ; i was <UNK> , after so much work , what was i doing back here ? !"
"i left class that evening , bumped around at home for awhile and slept ."
"when i woke up the next morning i laughed , because i realize why this had happened ."
even though i have n't had any energy training i 've always been aware that it 's around . and
"<#> other <UNK> work at the same office as the therapist originally recommended , but they 're not as experienced ."
she said of <#> : in a pinch you could try her .
"but do n't try the other person ; your <UNK> energy - wise , and she does n't have very good energy ; she 's very chaotic and negative ."
i remember leaving my <UNK> 's office scratching my head because i had no clue what she was talking about .
"it was n't until i woke up the morning of the second day of class that i understood , at a <UNK> level , what that statement meant ."
"it meant this stuff exists , it 's powerful , and along with that power comes responsibility ."
"i do n't want to give them anything <UNK> , nor do i want to pick anything up <UNK> ."
i need to learn to be just a <UNK> .
the second day we covered a lot - part of a <UNK> protocol that dr .
it was a bit rocky but a necessary part of the learning experience .
start - i had my rocky experience at the end of the first day .
i 'm sure other students were curious to see me leave crying .
"by the end of today , we 'd been working on each other , and the instructor and <UNK> had been working on students with particularly challenging problems ."
"the end result was by the end of the day , everyone could feel the <UNK> <UNK> because they were so strong ."
i realized the reason i could n't feel my <UNK> for a months is because my neck and <UNK> was so badly <UNK> .
"the instructor fixed me by using me as a demo , and after that i could feel my own <UNK> ."
we heard plenty of stories like : my <UNK> got <UNK> !
"wow , you look a lot better - your skin , you 're more <UNK> , your eyes seem more focused ."
a chronic bruise at the site of an installed steel plate disappeared practically overnight .
"and the icing on the cake for me was the afternoon , when my <UNK> input began to <UNK> with my partners ' ."
"we learned how to push clients into a <UNK> , then wait for their systems to start up again ."
"when my last partner worked on me , we both felt the <UNK> and felt when it started up again ."
the same happened when i worked on her .
i 've learned i definitely have a <UNK> <UNK> below which i ca n't perceive much .
and that 's what we 'll all be striving to improve from this point forward .
"time and space are an illusion , so why do we perceive time and space ?"
"why must we grow old , <UNK> , and die ?"
"i 've always looked on this universe as a giant playground , a place to explore ."
do we perceive time and space so that we experience what we otherwise could not ?
what would happen if we did n't have time ?
would we enjoy the dancer who <UNK> <UNK> across the stage ?
"there are times we all feel <UNK> by time and space , we 'd love to break those <UNK> and see beyond them ."
", i feel it 's inevitable . but as we seek beyond what we know , do we truly appreciate what we do have ?"
"<UNK> , <UNK> , the july , sept , and <UNK> <#> classes all had nearly <#> students , forcing the school to divide each class into <#> groups ."
"many in my class came from an it background , which i think was a huge reason why more than half of our class graduated with <UNK> or honors ."
"also , there is still a <UNK> of talented it professionals who truly understand what they are doing , especially in the oo and <UNK> worlds ."
"i 'm sure a lot of people wondered why <UNK> happened : corporate greed , the fact that <UNK> leads to replacing humans with technology , etc . here"
"i asked why , and she said there had been no impact in japan , simply because few indians speak japanese ."
projects that are <UNK> require <UNK> and that does n't seem to work at all .
i 'd always looked upon the english language as an awesome example of global glue .
"our wedding in <#> was a mini global gathering ; i 'm asian , my husband 's dutch ."
i 'd always thought the us had an edge over <UNK> that consisted of a <UNK> of countries with different languages and different cultures .
"not only do you have to get your work done , you have to <UNK> energy <UNK> everything into different languages ."
what <UNK> of creativity are <UNK> because of the delay or <UNK> to cross - <UNK> in communication ?
"but when it comes to <UNK> , this has definitely bitten us in the butt ."
"india was once an english <UNK> , so most indians speak english as a second language ."
we are literally at the mercy of anyone who is english - speaking anywhere in the world willing to work for less .
the healthcare crisis gives a whole new shade to <UNK> .
"so not only are the <UNK> there lower , but corporations do n't have to foot the bill for healthcare ."
it 's time to get off the <UNK> ( and
"<UNK> back , that 's another reason for the career change ; i 'm hoping to enable others to get off the <UNK> ) ."
"boy , a private practice today has a lot of neat options for <UNK> the reception and appointment handling !"
"i 've been doing a little research and ran into an answering service that could set up appointments , using online appointment tools like <UNK> ."
"very convenient for doctors , <UNK> , etc ."
"on another note , we 've been in a holding pattern to build a more energy efficient home ."
"unfortunately , our greatest challenge seems to be finding a general <UNK> who is n't too busy to build our home !"
yesterday we visited the property because it turns out we have some banana trees and they were making bananas !
i 'd never owned a <UNK> banana tree before .
"there he was , in broad daylight , hiking across the lawn ."
"i knew where his <UNK> was , so i quickly jumped out and ran over , and stopped him ."
"i was surprised at how quickly he can move , i 'm sure he saw me , but i got him anyway ."
"he 's quite heavy , a good <#> - <#> pounds ."
"so after we all got a good look at him , we let him go and off he went , back in his <UNK> ."
"i say "" fishing "" because we 're great at feeding the fish , not catching them ."
i do n't ever remember having so much trouble catching anything in nj when we were growing up .
"in fact , i have <#> childhood picture of my sister and i <UNK> smiling for the camera , along with a monstrous <UNK> sitting in front of us ."
"yep , it was as big as my little sister , and she was the <#> who hooked it ."
"we tried to catch <UNK> with bread , and kept the <UNK> near the surface so we could see ."
"almost immediately when the <UNK> goes in , you see it <UNK> around wildly as the fish <UNK> away ."
"within seconds it 's gone , and you do n't even have an opportunity to set the hook ! must be using the wrong hook ..."
here 's an interesting link : urllink <UNK> i take <UNK> 's <UNK> i class starting thursday .
"i still have some work to do to prepare for this class , and i have a feeling i 'm going to get <UNK> ."
i 've also stopped seeing my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for months now and my back has gone back to being a little messed up .
"that 's because i 've noticed if you mix too many <UNK> - <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , etc ."
"also , i 've found <#> very good <UNK> <UNK> in the tampa area but they use <#> slightly different <UNK> ."
"direct techniques , which she uses , mean <UNK> to areas where clients do n't like to move , to allow them to find a way to release ."
"i do n't think either because they 've both worked for me , with the right <UNK> ."
"and they 've both not worked for me , with the wrong <UNK> ."
i do feel each technique is better suited to different situations .
"if i have a client who 's more <UNK> to self - heal given the chance , i might try <UNK> techniques ."
"if someone is stuck and ca n't get out of that <UNK> himself , i 'll try the direct techniques ."
"of course each side poo - <UNK> the other , which i think is not right ."
"i 'm just thinking out loud as i begin <UNK> together material for my business website , <UNK> ."
"it 's already up , but i 'm thinking of a number of important <UNK> ."
"i 'm in the latter state right now , <UNK> since it 's been awhile since i 've been this inspired ."
"the inspiration is also coming from working on my business plan , which is <UNK> up nicely ."
i could n't believe we had <#> people show up at our house to watch the <UNK> dvd and hook in to a <UNK> <UNK> .
urllink <UNK> other interesting sites : urllink <UNK>
"tomorrow , sunday , we 're hosting an "" <UNK> "" party ."
the previous weekend we participated in a <UNK> call - a - <UNK> in an attempt to register as many new voters as possible .
and that does n't include the tons of messages we left on peoples ' answering machines ; i wonder what kind of effect that has ?
hope they have more call - a - <UNK> like this !
i also did most of the shopping necessary to start my new business .
"found a small desk , <UNK> unit , filing cabinet , etc ."
that will all fit comfortably into a <#> ' x <#> <#> ' room .
"i prefer starting off small , and i would n't mind staying like this for quite awhile since the executive <UNK> i picked already have a shared <UNK> area ."
the initial overhead in running a business like this ( successfully ) is not trivial .
i also have to work on getting an establishment license and <UNK> license .
"as you might tell from my bio , i 've been a <UNK> for <UNK> years ."
my sister gave her first concert when she was <#> <#> years old .
my dad assumed he had <#> little <UNK> for daughters but it turns out that 's not true .
<#> teenager wrote to my dad recently to follow up .
<#> using the techniques <UNK> in my dad 's book .
"<#> months later he entered a <UNK> competition hosted by his high school , and came in first place ."
he beat out others who had been taking lessons for <UNK> years .
and now i send in the application for my state of florida license and i 'm on my way to becoming an <UNK> .
"just in time , i have a lot to do before i can open up my office ."
i think the most <UNK> thing so far in switching from it to doing this type of therapy is helping people with <UNK> .
i have <#> patient who was in so much pain she was popping <#> - <#> <UNK> <#> hour pills each day .
"she came to me in tears because her mom suffered horribly before she died , and this woman did n't want to suffer the same way ."
"probably <#> of the most devastating aspects about <UNK> is the fact that <UNK> <UNK> often ca n't sleep , probably because of the pain ."
"same with this woman , she could n't sleep , she had restless legs , etc ."
"that 's a real dilemma because sleep helps soft tissue to heal , so the situation quickly <UNK> into a vicious spiral ."
"since i 've worked on this woman , her pain has gone from unbearable to between good and uncomfortable ."
"urllink <UNK> <UNK> - a national <UNK> here is the other article i forgot to mention regarding this subject , near the end ."
"it 's an idea i 've <UNK> around for awhile <UNK> , and now it seems others may be coming to a similar conclusion ."
"when <UNK> asked : "" well , how is history likely to judge your iraq war ? ”"
", bush replied : "" history , we don’t know ."
"we 're close to reaching the phenomenon in time known as "" peak oil "" , with no true alternative energy solutions in sight ."
"we 're deeply in debt , with no end in sight ."
"did you see the <UNK> tv ad "" child 's pay "" ?"
"we have seen a <UNK> slide in our rights and freedoms as americans ( patriot act ) , and the <UNK> possibility for martial law ."
"and now we live in a world <UNK> with an increasing human population and <UNK> resources , and why has n't the second coming occurred already ?"
is it because they have not yet accomplished all of god 's will by <UNK> the world of evil ?
urllink <UNK> americans need to arm themselves by <UNK> themselves .
"we need to register to vote , and hit the polls in november ."
and we need to ensure that the election results are not stolen again by companies like <UNK> .
"not much of an <UNK> for those of us in the tampa , st ."
"however , <UNK> <UNK> and other smaller towns were <UNK> ."
"instead , <UNK> <UNK> shortly before <UNK> into a cat <#> , possibly <UNK> cat <#> ."
"for about a half an hour to an hour , we sat <UNK> in front of the tv , feeling a bit like deer in the <UNK> ."
"frank made the comment it reminded him of the uncertainty principle - the more precisely the position is determined , the less precisely the momentum is known ..."
looking at the live footage from <UNK> <UNK> - few had prepared for the hurricane and they <UNK> possibly hours before the hurricane hit .
"i realize it is far better to feel <UNK> because you prepared and never got hit , than to not prepare and get <UNK> ."
not that i would ever want for this to happen
"such evidence would make people realize that alternative types of homes - homes that are more energy efficient , more <UNK> proof , etc ."
"are really the ideal way to go , especially all along <UNK> in hurricane - risk areas ."
"louis county library interesting link on the last <#> about <UNK> , but traffic must be high because i ca n't seem to access this site right now ."
so we 're taking the day off to trim some branches and trees to prepare .
:) the <UNK> must have anticipated a run ; i was surprised to walk into <UNK> and find there were still <UNK> goods available .
"i had a hurricane store but it was a bit old , and <#> can exploded some time ago"
so i thought now was a good time to replace it .
the other thing i 've been <UNK> over was a <UNK> like survival instinct for longer term food storage and water <UNK> .
"at a time like this , i wish we 'd been able to build our <UNK> home ."
"even though my office still is n't ready yet , i figure it will take time for awareness for my new business to <UNK> through the bay area"
"so i went to a network of executive women <UNK> today in downtown tampa ; the speaker was the mayor of tampa , pam <UNK> ."
she is dynamic and engaging in person ; this was the first time i 've ever met her .
"in the past , through the <UNK> chamber of commerce , i 've had the opportunity to meet <UNK> mayor jerry <UNK> and house representative <UNK> <UNK> ."
i did n't have a laptop with me so here are some highlights i <UNK> down from mayor <UNK> 's speech .
"she is a mother of <#> teenagers , so she began with some amusing stories on that subject ."
she seems committed to cracking down on drugs .
"currently , there is n't much <UNK> and activity in downtown tampa past business hours ; high on her priority list is building a <UNK> to attract more residents ."
she said the advantage of term limits is that it helps create a sense of <UNK> for projects like this .
she said she 's delivered a budget this year with no increases in spending .
<#> interesting question someone asked concerned <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> of new programs .

"okay , if this entry gets posted , the problem between blogger 's updated <UNK> editor and <UNK> ( my current default ) has been solved ."
"lately , i do n't know what 's gotten into me ."
i have a lot chances to get out of the house but i usually end up on my ' book for the rest of the day .
"but i think something really hit me the other day after i had gone to watch the action film i , robot ."
"well , as you probably know , i , robot just opened"
so i ended up <UNK> the crowds to watch the film and maybe it was a mistake .
"going to watch a film after it had played for a while , you tend to see the same type of people ."
"i.e. , people like myself who are watching the same film , in the same theater , by themselves ."
i think it 's time to take a breath of fresh air .
to get back into the world and join the masses .
"btw , it looks like blogger 's <UNK> editor is working on <UNK> now although it 's still not working on <UNK> ( my default web browser ) ."
"that sucked , but i guess it 's the price of free ."

i think that would make a cool touch to an already promising blogging tool .

” <UNK> lion in winter buying new clothes can be so much fun because they give you a chance to see yourself in a new way .
but sometimes shopping is not such a happy occasion .
"i bought all black , of course , but since it was an emergency i had to take whatever black pants i could get ."
"that ’s how i wound up with black <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a summer - <UNK> pattern : sun glasses , bathing suits , beach chairs ."
"i wore them yesterday , and all i needed was a big red ball to put on my nose ."
i pray that this is the last time i have to buy emergency pants .
i have been watching <#> remarkable events at the olympics today .
the first is the usa v. <UNK> <UNK> in men 's basketball .
"they won by <#> goals , a big margin in soccer , and <#> of the goals for portugal the iraqis accidentally kicked into their own goal ."
"i missed that match , but now am getting to witness them play ."
"if the iraqis win , they move on to the next round ."
a tie still keeps them in <UNK> to move on .
the energy and joy with which the iraqis are playing is <UNK> .
the next item on the list of <UNK> views concerns chemical weapons .
let ’s start by <UNK> some of what urllink the public version of the <UNK> said about iraq ’s chemical weapons .
"the bush administration claimed publicly that iraq posed a threat because of its ability to deliver chemical and biological weapons via <UNK> <UNK> vehicles , or <UNK> ."
"in urllink a speech on october <#> , <#> , president bush said “"
we 're concerned that iraq is exploring ways of using these <UNK> for missions <UNK> the united states .
"” then he said the following in urllink a speech on february <#> , <#> : “"
iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on <UNK> <UNK> vehicles with <UNK> far beyond what is <UNK> by the security council .
a <UNK> launched from a <UNK> off the american coast could reach hundreds of miles <UNK> . ”
"powell ’s <UNK> message included the following : “ according to iraq 's december 7th declaration , its <UNK> have a range of only <#> <UNK> ."
but we <UNK> <#> of iraq 's newest <UNK> in a test flight that went <#> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> ...
the <UNK> over the past ten years between iraq 's <UNK> program and biological and chemical warfare agents are of deep concern to us .
"iraq could use these small <UNK> ... to deliver biological agents to its neighbors or , if <UNK> , to other countries , including the united states . ”"
in the urllink “ <UNK> on the absence of wmd ” post
"i will discuss each of those , and i am going to start with a general examination of the october <#> national intelligence estimate , or <UNK> ."
this was the primary document upon which the bush administration based its case that saddam had wmd and had to be taken out via military force .
"even so , the <UNK> shows that it contained numerous <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> opinions ."
"in the august <#> issue of time , <UNK> is the <UNK> of the weekly "" <#> questions . """
"urllink the third question starts out with "" in your book , you <UNK> yourself , president bush , and secretary donald rumsfeld of inadequate <UNK> planning . """
"well , i agree that <UNK> is not responsible for the "" inadequate "" <UNK> planning ."
"however , as i will explain in a later post , the ultimate responsibility for that planning lies with the national command authorities , of which there are <#> :"
<UNK> said in the <UNK> of his book that his greatest surprise was “ the absence of <UNK> wmd in iraq .
"” in urllink parade , he insisted that “ every sign ... from arab leaders to intelligence <UNK> , had <UNK> that saddam had them ."
"again , this is something <#> would expect the bush administration to jump on ."
"here is a <UNK> war hero , a tough , no bullshit army general , saying everything <UNK> that saddam had wmd ."
surely that provides a justification for going to war .
"from <UNK> ’s book , it is clear that he does not like richard <UNK> ."
"in both urllink the parade interview and his book , <UNK> says “"
i never received a single page of <UNK> intelligence from richard <UNK> .
general tommy <UNK> has been in the news lately .
"last thursday ( july <#> ) , urllink cnn published an article that was basically a preview of an interview published sunday in urllink parade magazine ."
"i have read <UNK> of <UNK> ’s book , american soldier , and they say pretty much the same thing the articles and interviews do ."
i am quite sure bush and his supporters are going to try to use some of <UNK> ’s statements to their advantage .
"however , they had better be careful , for <UNK> also said some things that will not help bush ."
this will be the first post in a series about what <UNK> has said . before getting into the first topic
", i want to say that as a military commander , i have much <UNK> and respect for general <UNK> , and i agree with him on some issues ."
"the times article says that <UNK> <UNK> "" reliable intelligence sources , "" while <UNK> <UNK> conversations between <UNK> officials and saddam ."
"a similar denial came from a <UNK> royal palace official : "" his <UNK> did not have information that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction . """
"<UNK> asked <UNK> about these <UNK> , and here ’s what <UNK> had to say : "" uh - huh ."
""" at this point i’ll take general <UNK> at his word ."
"however , this raises at least <#> questions ."
"britain were on the wmd issue , and <#> ) do not want the rest of the arab world to think that they encouraged the u.s ."
"other than these possibilities , i don’t have an answer ."
"that is just as well , for the second question is more intriguing to me ."
"if <UNK> and <UNK> did make these statement to <UNK> , why is the bush administration not shouting this from the <UNK> ?"
why was there no mention of this in the senate intelligence committee report ?
i did various word searches on the entire report and found nothing about these statements .
it is hard to <UNK> that the senate intelligence committee knew nothing about this .
it is likewise difficult to <UNK> that the white house did not receive this information and has not previously <UNK> it .
"as with the first question , i have no <UNK> answers , but i do have some informed <UNK> ."
the first is that raising this issue could cause problems for a big potential arms sale to jordan .
"government officials have said jordan reached advanced talks with european <UNK> , mainly german and dutch , but that financial terms had not been <UNK> ."
""" so , we have a country wanting to buy a major weapons system from the u.s ."
while at the same time shopping for other major weapons systems from other countries .
"there is more to this potential arms sale to jordan , and it leads to guess # <#> ."
"the reason the state department is defending the possible sale is that israel is trying to block the sale , according to both urllink reuters and the urllink ap ."
"at the very least , that makes the deal a very tricky matter in <UNK> terms ."
"consequently , a retired general doing anything which could make an already <UNK> situation even more complicated could be <UNK> ."
"if the bush administration were to say anything about <UNK> ’s claims , that could really screw things up ."
poor w ... caught between making money for <#> of his defense <UNK> buddies and <UNK> israel .
either way he goes he runs the risk of losing political support in an election year .
and there is yet another political side to this .
jordan is a moderate ( as in non - <UNK> ) arab nation that is a key player in keeping the peace in the middle east .
"it has been at peace with israel since <#> , when the countries signed a peace <UNK> ."
has good <UNK> in an arab country which is not openly hostile or a threat to us .
"as such , jordan can play a key role in maintaining whatever credibility we have left in the arab world and <UNK> that credibility ."
"in other words , it would be a bad idea to piss off king <UNK> ."
it would be a bad idea to <UNK> him in any way .
"hello sweet girl , man i ca n't believe what happened today ."
"you know how conflict works , you basically try to resolve it and the situation is either <UNK> or not ."
"well , let me just <UNK> and say that over the last few years , i have had quite a few situations that were not <UNK> ."
"i feel sooo free , but at the same time , emotionally drained ."
"i feel that i finally have rid myself of some very very toxic garbage from my body , mind and soul ."
"i will use yada yada yada for my thoughts , feelings and desires ."
"well , today is my day , and it was ok ."
"i am amazed by the day , and how quickly it passed ."
"how quickly the last <#> years have passed , it <UNK> me really ."
"it seems to be a blur , and i am sooo set that i will not let the next <#> years be a blur ."
"the last <#> did matter , but i feel i wasted so much time ."
"i am tired of feeling so "" old school . """
i am amazed that how quickly time has passed and the 80s are now on cable and considered old .
we are on opposite sides of the room for most events .
"strange it is to me , i would like to at least be civil enough to sit somewhat close to each other , but kind of not really ."
"i mean , the tension , it is still soooo thick ."
at least now he is at the stage in which he <UNK> to a hello with a hey .
it used to be silence when i said hello .
it seems she <UNK> that at all costs .
he comes to the door to pick up my daughter
", i do n't know what it is , but wo n't say hello to my new husband ."
so the new squeeze stayed behind my ex and never moved .
why wo n't my ex 's ( new squeeze ) even come close to me ?
"why if my ex is sooo "" over "" me why does n't he at least behave in a civil manner ?"
"<#> . why ca n't we sit together , and be somewhat civil ?"
why does the fairly odd ex mother in law hate me ?
"i am immediately irritated , cynical , and hate that the <#> females are close enough friends to attend movies together ."
hate that they are sitting so close that their hair is touching .
"i wish i had a sister , a mother or someone i could do that with ."
when will i be the woman i so admire ?
"i can be instead of hiding from the world in my mind , house and soul ?"
when will i be the mother and wife that wants to bring their friends around to meet me ?
"maybe it is not as bad as it seems , maybe i am that woman and continue to beat myself up because of the tragedy ."
what can i do to get over the tragedy ?
what can i do so that it does not own me ?
i feel that every day i awake and kind of dread the day because i know that my overall feeling will be sad .
"i do n't know the answers to these questions , i know i want to be all i can be , but how ?"
maybe i just do it to quote another slogan .
i guess i will ask questions that never leave my mind . <#> .
was my family so oblivious to the fact that i was a child and should have been taken care of ?
"<#> . do men think it is ok to stare at women 's breasts , or do they just not think . <#> ."
why do men blow there noses in the shower ?
<#> . am i loved by my friends ?
"it is raining here , a huge <UNK> a bit ago , it was wonderful ."
"family is out shopping for me , it is my birthday , <#> week from today ."
i will be <#> and i am so glad i am here every day with my beautiful family .
the remainder of this week will be full of final <UNK> for next .
"then it all begins , my favorite time of year , fall , <UNK> and the lot until <#> ."
", i feel good , my skin is <UNK> which makes me frown , and am still <UNK> <UNK> for my own good , but that will come ."
my son is still <UNK> from the day before of <UNK> .
"this week i would like to say goodbye in my own way to the summer , and hello to the next act ."
i want to find good ways to <UNK> my little girl inside and cherish her .
"not sure how yet , but that would be a definite goal ."
"i want to start being more romantic and caring to my love , and cherish "" us . """
"i feel <UNK> sometimes , i am sure he does too ."
"hello sweet girl i clearly know what that means , and it has not been too bad ."
"i felt pretty good this weekend , after soaking in the hot tub on friday and getting my nails done on thursday ."
"<UNK> can do a world of good for me , let me tell ya ."
"hmm , the house <UNK> 's are soooo coming along and it looks so nice and <UNK> ."
"baby boy is off the <UNK> and he is ok , however i think something dramatic is up in his world ."
baby girl comes home tomorrow and the <#> of us begin the last week before school <UNK> <UNK> .
"that 's right , it is my <UNK> year and baby girl 's 7th ."
"i ca n't believe it , yet i can ."
":) i want of course to make this birthday <UNK> of something for me , not sure what yet ."
the drama with our families has slowed down mostly due to us just saying no .
"ok , enough for now , make this week matter , make a difference , be happy and be good to you ."
"husband arrives home , watches me carefully being <UNK> , talk son and husband into <UNK> spaghetti dinner , eat , rest , and blog ."
"i need to get out and heal me , i need to <UNK> me , i need ..."
is it unfair to say that i really do n't care what his friends or their parents feel ?
"<UNK> , my son is in a band , and let me say , <UNK> in a very inappropriate manner , hence the <UNK> ."
"it is so weird to live in a desert , coming from new england ."
i am used to <#> types of people ; fan people and air <UNK> people .
it is truly unfortunate when the <#> types marry each other .
"in may when it got to be <#> degrees with <#> % humidity , mark would try to sneak the air conditioning unit into the window frame ."
"mark , being from warm <UNK> , wanted to know why we would blow hot , humid air around the house when we could have air conditioning ."
"i think it goes back to my childhood , when the seasons were true seasons ."
"the sound of the shades getting sucked into the open window frame , wearing just underwear to bed , and waking up chilly with dew on the ground ."
i still remember taking <UNK> to the sound of the heat bugs .
we played in the <UNK> and made mud holes to lie in .
the only place that had air conditioning was the library .
we used to walk <#> miles just to hang out there and read .
"they had fans going as well , and i can still remember the loud sound of it in the <UNK> ."
it cracks me up that we then had to walk <#> miles home again in the heat holding library books with plastic covers sticking to our arms .
i think the church had the same fans as the library .
the best thing about mass in the summer was that it was usually quicker .
or maybe the time passed faster when we made <UNK> <UNK> in our <UNK> to fan ourselves .
"of <UNK> we had fancy , uncomfortable church clothes on that <UNK> when we sweat ."
the highlight of the summer was the swimming lessons .
"boy , was it hot walking to the community pool , but coming home with wet hair felt wonderful ."
"i used to play a game with my sister and my best friend , if we had money for an ice cream , what flavor would we get ?"
i think the last day of swimming lessons we got to get <#> .
i think that is what made summer seem so long .
now it seems to go so fast because we actually sleep at night and eat real dinners .
during the summer it was too hot for my mother to use the oven and we had a lot of great light meals and <UNK> .
i made zoe walk to the library with me this morning because it was only <#> .
"if you live in a desert climate , you understand that this is totally do - able ."
she complained the entire way and kept <UNK> me that it was hot .
i told her to be quiet so she could hear the heat bugs .
she said they were telling her it was hot .
"our apartment faces north and south in the shade , so i do n't have to turn on that dreaded ac until late afternoon ."
i put the <#> kids down for <UNK> at 2:30 and zoe asked me to lay down with her .

like a child ’s game they change the rules whenever things don’t go their way .

oh it ’s not much less <UNK> cheat <UNK> .
i sometimes go days without sitting at my home pc !
it was once my best friend . perhaps .
the information on the web just isn’t as good or as accessible as it used to be .
"try searching for <UNK> , msn , yahoo , it doesn’t matter ; ads are the first thing you see ."
"i could just read quality online , <UNK> still <UNK> to <UNK> online and the ny times is free ."
at least the print versions have the <UNK> to make the ads <UNK> attractive .
and the layout in print <UNK> itself to reading better than online .
"too much time staring at the computer all day as it is , my eyes need a break ."
"i think , in the end , it is about quality ."
read yahoo news and you get up to the minute crap .
"everyone <UNK> the same story on their own sites , exactly as the ap wrote it ."
"do a search sometime for a string of words from an article , see how many times it shows up exactly as printed ."
sure the ny times has had some egg on its face of late ( nothing like the post though !
but they also have quite a string of wins to their credit .
"well , i just skip the editorial <UNK> at least they aren’t owned by news <UNK> ."
"it ’s , by analogy , like bio - diversity ."
"they read their <UNK> , wide - spread , <UNK> , news and think that they have a good grasp on things ."
"as for <UNK> , well , i guess i just like to <UNK> people ."

so i was <UNK> by the article about the author 's <UNK> in choosing for whom to vote .
"i just needed to take issue with a few things : "" that [ <UNK> ] root causes lie in poverty and state failure "" wrong ."
it was common belief before ( and apparently after )

what else could explain their decision to give up life just to hurt someone else ?
they must not have had much to live for .
the profiles of the <#> <UNK> are more <UNK> close to middle - class than most people expected .

turns out that it is plain old middle - class guilt .
"the same motivation that drives <UNK> young white college girls to turn <UNK> and "" bi - <UNK> want to show just how devoted they are to their ideology ."
they want to show just how much they care about the ethics of their class .

"that , and they are too stupid to realize that they are being used ."

"personally , i found the animal rights <UNK> more entertaining than the show ."
"some of them were a little rough in my opinion as they called people "" bad parents "" and "" poor role models "" as they walked by ."
for some reason they did n't say anything to me .
maybe it was the i eat beef and i 'll knock you on your ass if you complain about it
"either way , we all had a fun night ."
the following is a portion of what was going to be chapter <#> of <UNK> .
i have however taken the story in a new direction so the public release of this text is ok .
there are some places in this world that should never be called home .
"for scott nelson , a <UNK> single bedroom apartment at <#> <UNK> street was that place ."
"constructed in <#> as the palace hotel , the <UNK> building stands as a dark reminder of better days long past ."
"once <UNK> to the elite , the palace now only <UNK> the <UNK> and the poor ."
"scott wandered through the main lobby , occasionally <UNK> down at the tired and cracked <UNK> floor ."
"approaching the grand <UNK> , his eyes followed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as it <UNK> up from the main floor to the balcony level ."
allowing his thoughts to drift scott imagined gentlemen in their black <UNK> <UNK> holding the white - <UNK> hands of their <UNK> as they <UNK> down red <UNK> stairs .
"a magnificent <UNK> <UNK> above the <UNK> , the glass reflecting the light in every direction like <UNK> cut diamonds ."
at the bottom of the stairs a hotel <UNK> stands at attention in his <UNK> pressed red uniform and cap .
he smiles and <UNK> to the couples as they pass him by .
the giggles of a child <UNK> jerk scott from his fantasy .
"as scott turns , ten - year - old bobby <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> <#> - foot body into scott ’s arms ."
his mother mary approaches from behind <UNK> to hold onto <#> bags of groceries .
“ he ’s wondering why you keep looking at those stairs all the time .
"” <UNK> bobby to the floor , scott <UNK> bobby on the head before <UNK> mary of <#> of her bags ."
this place hasn’t been a hotel for <#> years .
why you keep thinking of such things is beyond me .
i just wish i could have seen this place when it was worth seeing .
"” turning back towards the <UNK> , the previous vision of the grand <UNK> is now replaced with grim reality ."
the remains of the once <UNK> appointed red <UNK> on the stairs is now no more than a few worn sections of cloth <UNK> to the rotting floor boards .
a <UNK> of yellow tape is tied between the <#> <UNK> <UNK> the stairs off limits .
the brilliant light of the <UNK> has died and been replaced with a row of <UNK> <UNK> lights .
"attracted to the light , a large fly circles the ceiling as it <UNK> and occasionally <UNK> itself blindly into the <UNK> ."
mary gives scott a light bump in the shoulder .
“ are you going to stare at those stairs all day or are you going to help me get this stuff up stairs ?
” bobby <UNK> passed scott and mary as he races towards the buttons for the elevator doors .
mary ’s nose <UNK> as she smiles at her son ’s enthusiasm .
scott eyes the stuffed grocery bags . “ <#> bags .
chin finally give you a raise or something ? ”
i just found some good sales that ’s all .
“ well . if you’d like i’ve got a couple of <UNK> left over from work last night in the fridge .
you and bobby could join me for dinner . ”
i’ve been up all day and i really need to get some sleep .
how about leaving bobby with me and us boys can have a night of pizza and old karate movies .
"” <UNK> with his arms in the air , bobby kicks up his left foot in his best bruce lee <UNK> ."
i spent my week - end building a fort for my daughter sarah .
"at least , she believes its only for her ."
she 'll be surprised when katherine is old enough to play with it .
"for now , it 's easier letting her think its her fort ."
"so , you have somehow made it to <UNK> and want to know a little about me ."
i 'm a <UNK> software <UNK> with dreams of <#> day becoming a fiction writer .
i have a head full of fantastic story ideas that are screaming to be written .
i will share some of them here in the future .
"at the moment , i 'm a little overwhelmed with the amount of work i have to do ."
i have a full time programming job at a local hospital .
"on top of my regular day , i put in an extra few hours at night to help make ends meet ."
"sarah , my oldest is <#> and katherine will be <#> weeks old tomorrow ( yes , she 's quite new ) ."
whenever i can get my bloody palm pilot <UNK> again i 'll upload some photos of everyone .
"for now , i have to get back to work ."
i 've been <UNK> and <UNK> over setting up this site for some time now .
i wanted to have a place where i could post my thoughts and samples of my writing .
i decided on giving blogger a try to see how it fits for content .
the concept looks pretty good and should fit what i 'm going for .
hopefully this site will aid in my writing rather than distract me from getting to work .
i 've been thinking a lot lately about trying to go into business for myself full time .
"it 's a <UNK> thought , but could be very rewarding ."
i 've been wanting to do this for a few years now and have always held back .
it 's pretty safe staying in a well paid job rather than <UNK> it all for the possibility of nothing .
if i can establish a client base before i give up my current job i might feel safer .
being in the programming industry is a tough sell sometimes .
it 's been a busy few weeks since i lasted posted .
during the past couple of weeks i have had a long deserved vacation .
the <UNK> falls thing for a few days and i managed to catch up on my fishing and some movies .
i also found time to launch urllink <UNK> which is a free school for learning web technologies .
"the first course is an introduction to html and i plan on following up with some more advanced courses such as php , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"it has been crazy getting here , as i started this journey on 24th april ."
the truck then promptly broke down <#> miles away from my cousin ’s house !
and then it packing up on her <UNK> ?
<UNK> is <#> of the most beautiful places i have ever seen and well worth a visit if you are ever out this way .
i then rode back down through the <UNK> of <UNK> past area <#> and death valley to las vegas and back to my cousin ’s house in arizona .
"it was good to relax , do some camping , laugh and point at fat americans and take some time out ."
"i am happy out here in san jose , it is incredible ."
i am so happy to be out of new york !
"i am still trying to organize all my <UNK> , lesson plans , etc ."
i ca n't believe i have this much stuff .
lauren was teasing me that if i would throw out a few more things it would be a little easier .
"i did come across some good stuff that i want josh and i to use , so in the end , i guess this will be worth it ."
josh made the <UNK> aa travel team so that combined with all the hiking he does will take care of <UNK> .
i found some good ideas for a few books to read and a couple of <UNK> to go along with them for the presidential election .
he watched edward 's and kerry 's speech with us and gets involved in all the political talk that goes on in our house .
kate and i registered to vote here the other day .
this should be really interesting to follow with josh since we were learning about the revolution last year and went into the declaration and the branches and such .
we 'll see how much either of us remembers .
he 's got the better memory lol and has to end up <UNK> me sometimes .
i really think that because we discuss things so much that it why he tends to hold onto the information .
"in talking about things and telling <UNK> what he learns he "" claims "" the things he 's learning about ."
"my great friend from <UNK> , jan , sent me the following really good websites that i wanted to share with everyone : urllink <UNK>"
urllink <UNK> urllink <UNK> - <UNK> urllink <UNK> hope someone finds these helpful .
well steve and josh are gone to his last ice hockey <UNK>
so i thought i would try and write a little more .
so it 's always best for me to stay home lol .
"the book that josh ask me to read with him was the flower hunter : william <UNK> , america 's first <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> ray ."
i love it that josh still wants me to read to him .
he says he loves my voices that i do when i read <UNK> .
i think we were all inspired to try and sketch things in our nature journals .
"last night i began to read again to josh the book carry on , <UNK> ."
if anyone reads this post and knows how to pronounce this name i would love to hear from you .
i have always said bow like in the bow of a ship .
we had started this at the end of our last term but did n't finish it and had to give it back to the library .
the other day when i was at the library i took it back out .
yesterday as i was browsing through it trying to figure out where we had left off josh told me the exact spot we had stopped reading .
he remembered the last thing we had read of it over <#> months ago .
he wants me to read a picture book in the morning and from a classic book at night before bed .
"i have been cleaning out all my papers i have printed out from the internet with lesson plans , <UNK> etc ."
i go crazy with all these ideas and want to do everything .
i know that josh and i both need some structure or it does n't work for us
but i would really like to read even more this year and not worry so much about the written <UNK> that he is actually learning something .
i know he is and that should be enough !
i have recently began putting together a list of picture books that we use in our studies .
i like to read them in connection with whatever we are studying .
they make a very nice introduction to our topics and helped to expand on whatever we are learning in a short amount of reading time .
they are so well written and many times the pictures that accompany them are beautiful .
i have tried to find a resource that lists them by subject matter .
i have even been <UNK> with seeing if this is something that might be <UNK> .
"when i say ... "" i am a christian "" i 'm not shouting "" i 'm clean livin ' """
"i 'm whispering "" i was lost "" now i 'm found and forgiven ."
"when i say ... <UNK> am a christian "" i do n't speak of this with pride ."
i 'm <UNK> that i stumble and need christ to be my guide .
""" i 'm not trying to be strong ."
i 'm <UNK> that i 'm weak and need his strength to carry on .
"when i say ... <UNK> am a christian "" i 'm not <UNK> of success ."
i 'm admitting i have failed and need god to clean my mess .
"when i say ... <UNK> am a christian "" i still feel the sting of pain , i have my share of <UNK> so i call upon his name ."
"when i say ... <UNK> am a christian "" i 'm not <UNK> than thou , i 'm just a simple <UNK> who received god 's grace , somehow ."
"in my so - so recent history , i was confronted with an illness that left me in a <UNK> state ."
a helpful book at that time <UNK> my <UNK> as chronic fatigue .
a friend advised me to go vegetarian and so i did .
"apparently , my <UNK> <UNK> didn’t help much either in <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> ."
what followed was a down - to - earth lifestyle that was <UNK> in itself .
"nowadays , when someone ’s cranky , i turn cranky . and"
"at the end of any emotional debate my only <UNK> is : what ’s eating you , ba ?"
[ don’t you ask that ? ] some <UNK> <UNK> that we <UNK> the characteristics of the animals we <UNK> or wolf .
"out of observation , i kind of believe that , really ."
"today , there ’s a <UNK> to go pure veggie again ."
it seems that there ’s something to it that i miss [ or perhaps due to this <UNK> and <UNK> that i wish to <UNK> ] .
"as i recall , someplace tucked in my journals is this floating personal premise : <UNK> good food is to be <UNK> of the company you keep ."
"hmm , so <UNK> that i have remembered it today ."
"somehow , i can figure what ’s been eating me all the while ."
"we decided to have a quiet evening of acoustic <UNK> music at conspiracy garden <UNK> , where accomplished musician - poet joey <UNK> was playing for the night ."
the friday crowd was greeted with <UNK> ng <UNK> and was entertained with more <UNK> from the artist ’s archive .
"among the audience was <UNK> folk musician <UNK> , sporting a pink shirt sans the familiar long hair ."
part of our <UNK> was some of joey ’s mellow alternative hits <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> volunteered in <UNK> .
"by this , joey ’s songs became more tangible to us in thought ."
"that is why probably , i favor to hear songs where it can possibly be most intimate and animated ."
"when the phenomenon is heard , there is the realization of the universal connection , which some of us , if not all , seek to recognize and remember ."
"people are often <UNK> , <UNK> , and self - centered ; forgive them anyway ."
"if you are kind , people may <UNK> you of selfish , <UNK> motives ; be kind anyway ."
if you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies ; succeed anyway .
"if you are honest and frank , people may cheat you ; be honest and frank anyway ."
"what you spend years building , someone could destroy overnight ; build anyway ."
"if you find <UNK> and happiness , they may be jealous ; be happy anyway ."
"the good you do today , people will often forget tomorrow ; do good anyway ."
"give the world the best you have , and it may never be enough ; give the world the best you 've got anyway ."
"you see , in the final analysis , it is between you and god ; it was never between you and them anyway ."
having a new <UNK> named <UNK> is a unique experience .
"to begin with , i haven’t met anyone named <UNK> [ there ’s this song though that strikes in my head ] ."
"young and pretty mac , as i got to know her , is a creative and gifted being ."
"some people , on the other hand , exercise a huge amount of effort to keep others at bay ."
"mac and i didn’t talk much , such that our <UNK> conversations consumed only <#> minutes [ or <UNK> ] of our built - up lives ."
my short chat with mac <UNK> a spontaneous <UNK> of <#> swirling rainbow <UNK> engaged in <UNK> <UNK> .
it is amusing if you see it this way [ also a handy tool when you encounter <UNK> <UNK> down the stream ] .
"that same evening with mac , other observed <UNK> in the room were pulling attempts to <UNK> with the seemingly <UNK> <UNK> in sight ."
"<UNK> , perhaps , but that is how some <UNK> behave ."
"so as mac and i continued to enjoy the music in between our conversations ; and conversations in between songs , a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> our meeting ."
"the <UNK> goddess dancing on the candle - lamp <UNK> our table seemed to have been enjoying herself , too ."
"and so , the evening faded , and the <UNK> turned into tiny <UNK> bubbles as the music played ."
"i <UNK> mac farewell as we end another day , and perhaps , meet each other again in the stream of dreams ."
"karma go in peace , you will be missed ."
"karma mum was with you at the last final breath , a sigh in her heart for eternity ."
"loss , such a small word , sorrow of <UNK> ."
"it 's strange how life so often ( always ? ) gives you what you need , when you need it ."
"i have a birthday upcoming , part of which will <UNK> a piece of new equipment for my studio ."
"after all , the muse can not communicate through you if you do not place yourself at its <UNK> to begin with ."
"this is out of balance , for me , and must be <UNK> ."
i 'm at least feeling lighter and more positive than when i started this blog .
"firstly , i want to thank you for your very kind and encouraging words about my music ."
"i am honestly stunned by the feelings you express for the work i have done , and it does mean an incredible lot to me ."
"i do n't know anything about being a musical "" genius ."
right now such experiences seem long distant to me .
"that does not rule out having future experiences that rival , or even <UNK> , them ."
"but , for the moment , there 's "" nothing there . """
"secondly , you speak about forgiveness , and as you have read , a lot of what i 'm currently exploring with myself <UNK> around this issue ."
"( <UNK> or <UNK> , or both - <UNK> . )"
"i was never in any doubt that you were in as much emotional <UNK> as i was , back then -- i suspect you were in more ."
i have no doubts that you have grown and changed a great deal since last we spoke -- <UNK> years is a long time .
i have grown and changed <UNK> in that time .
"( and yet , as you have seen from my blog entries , i still <UNK> with some of the same issues that troubled me back then . )"
i hope to hear from you via e - mail .
i really am happy to hear from you .
<UNK> tests are tests that measure some aspect of an implementation 's behaviour against an expectation and answer whether the software <UNK> with the expectation .
"for example , a test that measures the time required to perform a specific task is not a <UNK> test ."
a test that measures the time required to perform a specific task and <UNK> it to a <UNK> is a <UNK> test .
<#> very strong benefit of using <UNK> tests is that creating the tests forces the development team to achieve detailed and objective designs .
this <UNK> beyond the coding team to include program and product management : writing tests that <UNK> <UNK> with requirements force product management to articulate detailed and objective requirements .
"if the requirement are not well understood , you will end up with a solution to the wrong problem : this is more difficult to change ."
"the <#> most important types of <UNK> tests are : acceptance tests , which <UNK> an implementation 's <UNK> with requirements ."
"unit tests , which <UNK> an implementation 's <UNK> with a design ."
acceptance tests acceptance tests <UNK> an implementation 's <UNK> with requirements .
<#> style of development is to write detailed requirements and then translate the requirements into acceptance tests .
a <UNK> approach is to write less detailed requirements and to consider the acceptance tests as an extension of the requirements document .
"when using the <UNK> approach , it is important that customer or market facing <UNK> retain ' ownership ' of the expression of requirements ."
"a protocol i have seen work very well is for a program manager to write requirements , and then the program manager <UNK> acceptance tests with the programming team ."
"for example , a <UNK> is allowed to reject any acceptance test that <UNK> an implementation rather than a requirement ."
this is quite properly the <UNK> of unit tests and not an issue for the program manager to determine .
"consider a high - level market requirements document ( "" <UNK> "" ) ."
"what does it mean to "" flesh out the <UNK> with more detail "" or to "" drill down into <#> of the requirements "" ?"
"well , it does n't mean "" write <UNK> for a solution ."
"that 's a common <UNK> : when asked for more detail , product managers get sucked into designing software ."
"more detail for an <UNK> should mean "" describe the problem to be solved in more detail . """
the most useful detail possible is a complete list of acceptance tests .
this test is now a detailed expansion of some requirement .
write as many acceptance tests as you can .
"for incredible <UNK> , <UNK> your acceptance tests using tools like urllink <UNK> ."
unit tests unit tests <UNK> an implementation 's <UNK> with a design .
"since requirements are implementation - free , there should be no <UNK> between the definition of unit tests and the definition of acceptance tests ."
customer or market facing <UNK> such as program managers have an abstract interest in unit tests for this reason .
but changes to acceptance tests reflect changes to the product contract : they are an element of the plan of record .
"bugs and <UNK> when a release ( internal or external ) is tested , bugs are inevitable ."
"<UNK> , this test was already expressed as an acceptance or unit test ."
"in practice , a bug report often <UNK> an <UNK> test , <#> that was n't spelled out as part of the process ."
this is not a bad thing : tests <UNK> as the team 's understanding <UNK> .
it 's important to <UNK> bugs that reflect <UNK> in acceptance from bugs that reflect <UNK> in design .
"say there 's a menu option that displays a <UNK> key , but the key does n't work ."
"you can write a unit test for this bug : "" pressing control j should <UNK> the jump command . "" but that is n't an acceptance test ."
"an acceptance test would be "" for every menu item that displays a <UNK> key , the <UNK> key should <UNK> the command ."
because <#> way to fix the broken control j would be to not display the <UNK> key in the menu .
"the software would still <UNK> to the acceptance test , but it would fail the unit test ."
<UNK> <UNK> over bugs is <#> excellent way to raise your chances of shipping acceptable software on time .
"i tried to write "" from my heart "" and to express <UNK> principles rather than give a specific prescription for how to write software ."
"in this article i 'm going to use some of the same quotes , only i 'm going to give specific directions ."
everybody is talented because everybody who is human has something to express are you working on a personal project right now ?
are you working on something that will have an <UNK> stamp of you in it ?
are you holding back because you do n't have that <#> - dollar idea that will change the world ?
"this is a subtle way of beating yourself down , of not giving yourself credit for the talents you already possess ."
"you are talented , you have something that should be shared ."
"of course , it may be a big hit no matter how <UNK> it sounded when it started ."
urllink dave <UNK> started a company to sell a <UNK> environment .
he ended up with a company that helped launch the weblog revolution .
do n't get me started talking about urllink the guy who created a web site for selling <UNK> <UNK> .
"what about the millions of <UNK> tons of books published with the advice to research , research , research before you start your business ?"
i have a longer answer about market research below .
<UNK> ! a <UNK> word ! as though shakespeare could spell !
absolute crap sells when it brings a new idea to the world .
the quality of the idea is more important than the quality of the software .
"do n't <UNK> your software , <UNK> it for years lest someone file a bug report or tell you that you ca n't code anything ."
"urllink worse is better : release early , release often ."
get it into the world and <UNK> it with feedback .
it 's easier for critics to find flaws than to appreciate the <UNK> of the change you are <UNK> .
"when apple released <UNK> , what did people say ?"
"how about "" it sucks , it only has <UNK> . """
"well , of course they had to add more memory ."
did n't the first pc come out with <UNK> ?
the point is that the most important thing is to ship your software .
you 'll have many chances to polish it later .
"get it out early , do n't worry about the <UNK> , and let it surprise you ."
and it always feels like making your software better will take more time .
how many are there because they capture some essential truth in the software ?
and how many are there because there 's some ' should ' or ' ought to ' that drove the decision ?
"for example , if you 're writing a web application , does it really need to be .net or <UNK> ?"
do you really need <UNK> to implement <UNK> ? or would <UNK> get the job done faster and simpler ?
"there 's a whole debate on faster , lighter development ."
"the point is , unless the core of your idea is about xml and <UNK> , you do n't need it ."
you may choose it if it helps you express your fundamental idea more <UNK> .
"but if it 's a lot of extra work , what are you writing ?"
why should n't you do market research before you write your software ? by all means research the market when you 're ready to sell . and
maybe at that moment you 'll make some changes .
what 's the market for another <UNK> to go head to head with apple computer ?
what 's the market for a mouse and bit - <UNK> graphics ?
"good thing you skipped the market research , because you 're apple computer and in <#> you will change the world with <UNK> ."
": <UNK> 's customers have voted thumbs down on their star <UNK> and your own customers have told you that "" lisa technology "" sucks ."
"anyways , here 's the real issue : market research is adding and <UNK> and <UNK> letters ."
"well , <#> possibility is that you do n't write your software ( "" nobody wants to pay for it "" ) ."
"write what 's in your heart , and let 's find out . once again"
", this post was inspired by a chapter in urllink guy <UNK> 's book urllink the computer <UNK> ."
"if you 'd like more inspiration , buy guy 's book the <UNK> way , where he shares his feelings about beautiful software and beautiful companies ."
sort of an interesting challenge : had to write a story that could only be <#> words .
"not <#> , not <#> , but <#> exactly , and the only guidelines were the theme "" alien candle shop ."
""" have my short story "" <UNK> summer "" submitted to <UNK> <#> <UNK> ."
could be very cool to be included in that <UNK> .
"getting settled in place here , and ready to start <UNK> ."
"the move was monstrous , the days hotter than hell and humidity sky - high ."
"of course , now that we 're done that part , the <UNK> have dropped to a comfortable cool ."
my new house has a <UNK> lot <#> side ; and i 'm surrounded by death on the other with a <UNK> .
"funny thing is , i have n't felt this alive in years ."
i took a walk on sunday morning ; <UNK> along the <UNK> and woods surrounding me .
"<#> large <UNK> and a couple of <UNK> got <UNK> by me and took off , white <UNK> waving good bye as they <UNK> ."
rabbits are everywhere and i saw the <UNK> <UNK> i 've ever seen .
"between that and the ridiculously <UNK> <UNK> , i feel like i 'm in a nature preserve ."
how the hell did i not go postal living in the city that long ?
all i know is that i was well on my way .
i 've been here sleeping since last wednesday and i 'm amazed at how comfortable i feel here already .
"but those things are like looking at tiny scars or <UNK> on the face of an old , familiar friend ."
"today , i make <UNK> on a new house ."
"well , i mean , it 's not new ."
"actually it 's sort of old , but it 'll be new to me ."
there 's so much concrete around here that it <UNK> up blood and secrets more <UNK> than a triple <UNK> <UNK> sheet .
and there 's so many like - minded negative people in this city that they just suck the energy right out of ya .
my new place is by a <UNK> ; lot of old deaths in there .
but the town i live in now is so much more haunted .
time to go to <UNK> in a half hour .
i 'll bring a few <UNK> wooden <UNK> with me .
he is <#> years old and faces charges of <UNK> us economic <UNK> against the former <UNK> by playing an exhibition match in <#> .
he has been in <UNK> from the us since he was <UNK> later that year by a federal grand jury for <UNK> the <UNK> .
"the un imposed <UNK> against <UNK> for supporting <UNK> aggression in <UNK> , and the us banned its citizens from doing business there ."
"let me repeat this part , because ... oh , i do n't know"
... it sounds sort of important ; he is being charged for playing an exhibition match in <#> .
"mother , do you think they 'll try to break my balls ?"
"okay people , i 'm only going to post this once , so i expect you to commit it to whatever <UNK> brain cells you have left ."
poor planning on your part does not justify an emergency on my part .
i just watched cnn a few minutes back and saw a segment related to the tiger that escaped and was shot .
the guy who used to play <UNK> had a pet tiger that was like <#> years old or something .
"he got loose and eventually , "" authorities "" shot and killed it ."
<#> . <#> . <#> . a lady is getting charged with animal <UNK> .
she offered to use her pet pig as <UNK> to try and <UNK> the tiger in and capture it .
"she drove it to the area in the trunk ( air conditioned , btw ) of her <UNK> and someone got bent about that"
does anyone else have a problem with this ?
they think it 's cruel to put a pig in an air conditioned trunk ?
"i got some info for anyone who thinks that was cruel : pigs are breakfast . and that , people , is the <UNK> 's report ."
the fact that the subject of this prayer was for my own selfish desire to survive does not <UNK> from <UNK> which i applied to my devotion .
we did in due course arrive at the hotel .
i have been assured i am now immune from small <UNK> and <UNK> blessed .
my first meeting with <UNK> was good and meeting up with the small international community of yoga students has been great .
"life in <UNK> is simple , slow yet filled with intense <UNK> and powerful yoga practice ."
tina is a local indian woman who has a cafe of sorts in her home for students to eat .
i often stay there for a time to paint in my sketch books .
the rest of the day is spent either exploring the region or relaxing .
"i spend part of every day drawing and painting from my imagination and studying <UNK> , chanting and the yoga <UNK> ."
"my <UNK> teacher is <UNK> , who <UNK> me i still have much work to do in order to be perfect in my studies ."
he is very strict but in a good <UNK> indian sort of way .
i <UNK> that if i continue to progress in <UNK> at the current rate i will have some <UNK> in ten years or so .
"often students spend the day <UNK> at the pool at the southern <UNK> a large hotel nearby , or sometimes <UNK> around on our <UNK> ."
i 'm trying to get in as much study and relaxation as possible before returning to my hectic new york schedule .
he is full of laughter and light and wisdom .
there is a <UNK> festival going on and folks are carrying around <UNK> of the elephant headed god .
"richie had the <UNK> to make everyone feel good about being around him , and helped everyone to feel better about themselves ."
"he was telling me what a good woman i was , and how he respected me and was happy for me in my life ."
"he was spending good time with <UNK> , who had loved him deeply for so long , and who was just so happy being in his company ."
"his sister gina was a <UNK> at a home for mentally challenged adults , and we were hanging out with the guys in the house that night ."
<#> loved richie like a brother and <UNK> him around all the time .
"richie would treat him equally , as we all did , but they way he treated him was just so touching , it made me cry ."
"he was a loving , caring , man who shared his heart and soul with so many people and touched so many lives ."
"she sounded sad and <UNK> told me to sit and said ' a terrible thing happened . """
"richie <UNK> was killed in a car accident this morning "" ."
over and over <UNK> friends were trying to comfort me and
my mom just told me to stay where i was and that my brother would stop there to see me and then he 'd be coming up .
i knew i could not just leave my car in maryland .
i knew that i had school the next day .
my brother came by and hugged me and we cried .
some girls gave me a beer and hugged me .
<UNK> came out and i actually cried through the whole concert .
i knew we had a new angel in our lives watching over us .
and i have felt him with me every single day since .
thanks for loving my family and being like a brother .
you are always an angel in my heart .
", there 's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground"
"so , i ask you ... why do we build up so much drama in our lives ?"
thursday is the day i 've been dreading for the past <#> weeks .
"as you can imagine , trying to <UNK> something that will please everyone is nearly impossible ."
my personal preference was to go to hot air <UNK> .
"so , we took this vote and to my <UNK> they all chose the backyard <UNK> ."
i guess you can never predict what women will do .
"so , we 've determined it 's a <UNK> ."
"oh boy , that will be fun at the height of hottest time of the day in the texas heat ."
did i mention that it 's supposed to be <#> degrees tomorrow ?
"so , where do we have this shin - dig ?"
"so i can use my new picnic basket ( complete with all the "" stuff "" ) that someone bought me last christmas ."
"however , against my better judgement they talked me into having it at my house ."
"plus , i live about <#> - <#> minutes from the office and that 's without traffic ."
"now , keep in mind i keep the house pretty clean but have been <UNK> it up a bit over the last day or so ."
"these women love to pick up <UNK> tips , so i want everything to look like we actually do n't live in the house ."
"after all , i have a reputation to keep up ."
after having you read <#> paragraphs about this i 've suddenly decided it was a big ol ' waste of time even writing about it .
"let 's chalk it up to "" just trying to fill the space . """
i 'll end that topic with i 'm not looking forward to it and the best i can hope for is that nobody <UNK> anything from our house .
"we try to stay busy and do at least something every night ... run an <UNK> , hang out in the backyard , etc ."
", it 's way too hot here so when we got home"
we took off our work clothes and hung out in the darkest room in the house in our boxers watching t.v .
we did n't even open the garage door and take a dip in the pool .
"all in all , it was a nice night ."
"that 's it for now . until then , <UNK>"
guess i 'm still thinking about it <#> ) ( i 'm assuming the other posts on responsibility are under our belt )
so if we find ourselves discouraged by the tough things in our lives or distracted by the enjoyable things in life there is <#> answer .
we have allowed our driving passion for god to either be overwhelmed by either pleasure or pain .
".... <UNK> way , we 've put another god in charge ."
but that 's all words .... the doing is another thing entirely .
just realized that comments were restricted to those people who also had blogs registered to <UNK> .
i 've changed that setting to be open to all ... so comment away !
read what i wrote last night ... hope it was n't confusing .... but was thinking more 2day .
the relationship between driving passion ( <UNK> ) and responsibilities ( <UNK> ) can be seen in so many areas of our lives and @ so many levels .
because of my <UNK> for my family i take on the <UNK> of my job .
"the <UNK> for my family <UNK> to a <UNK> for my job but not for the job 's sake , it is still for the families ' sake ."
because i now have a <UNK> for my job i take on the <UNK> within my job .
and so the things my job requires me to do that may be <UNK> to me
"i have a <UNK> to do , not for their sake , but for my families ' sake ."
it is like the layers of an onion .... in some way .... i guess :)
so ... as we follow god what can come between us unless we choose to exchange our <UNK> for him with a <UNK> for something else .
"basically , unless we begin to worship something else as god ."
surely not those things we do n't enjoy or that cause us pain !
our <UNK> for god makes those things <UNK> and as james said we are able to <UNK> in the hard places of life .
not because they are hard but because our <UNK> for god makes them a <UNK> thing if they fall within our <UNK> .
so .... the question then is .... what has your <UNK> ? ? ? ? ?
<UNK> ps - now u know why i call this thoughts crashing :/
as i was working today i had thoughts about responsibility running around my head .
sometimes they are but probably an equal time they are not .
that got me thinking about whether you are supposed to enjoy your responsibilities .
and if you do n't are you in the wrong somehow ?
i wo n't bore with the entire thought path it took me to get to my end thoughts and i 'll just jump to some of my conclusions .
if i enjoy a responsibility of mine and develop a passion to accomplish it i 'm not sure that is a good thing .
"if part of my job is to fish and i grow to absolutely love it , let 's say , more than i love my job ."
in some sense it has replaced my original passion for my job with a passion for fishing . and
in some ways my passion for fishing may very well conflict with my passion for my job and my <UNK> of my other responsibilities .
a good example would be a parent working to provide for their children .
short - changing their children ( their original passion ) in the process ?
"well , anyway , that 's what i was thinking today ."
"that 's why jesus said "" greater things than i have done you will do . """
because he knows that his passion <UNK> us to surrender all to him .
all that we like and all that we do n't .
if i 've confused instead of <UNK> just chalk it up to someone with too much time on their mind <#> ) <UNK>
"<UNK> climbing <UNK> with bare hands seemed impossible to me , but i have realized that the impossible remains until you make it possible <UNK>"
<UNK> robert urllink <UNK> robert - risk urllink what is the level of your risk ?
urllink into the wardrobe : a web site devoted to c. s. lewis great website -- will give you a good <UNK> of lewis .
you become the container that people with passion move through .
"the <UNK> pipe is part of the equation , i guess , but the water that is flowing through the pipe ... that is the moving agent ."
"when your life lacks passion you are not a <UNK> , you are an exist - er ."
"you are not an <UNK> , at best , you are an <UNK> ."
you are not the gun but the <UNK> .
"i guess a response may be "" but are n't the pipe and the <UNK> needed ? """
but i think that just <UNK> where the analogy breaks down and our fears succeed in convincing us that to never risk is a good thing .
nobody i know grew up thinking that in their <UNK> dreams they would be the best water boy a super bowl team was ever served by .
we dreamt we were the <UNK> of the team .
"for the large majority of us , we never dreamed to someday be in the hole we 've <UNK> out for <UNK> ."
they were going to have a real and lasting impact .
well ... looks like the world is safe .
i 'm just not happy with that ' cuz it stinks .
i refuse to believe that we ca n't change things .
i believe we can turn the world upside down .
those who oppose and do n't run are just dumb .
i think we hold in us a power that our bodies should struggle under the weight of .
<UNK> would be a good word to describe it .
so ... i guess i 'm just tired of the middle ground huh ?
whatever i am i 'm guessing it will be fun !
""" <#> of the worst things about going is the leaving behind . """
"it is almost like the force of gravity , as if it had fingers and hands physically <UNK> you , begging you to stay ."
it is almost a <UNK> or denial of the place you 've been .
kind of amazing that in our cultural christian belief system we take the example of jesus ' sacrifice and call it <UNK> to live exactly the opposite of it .
jesus poured his life out in <UNK> to what he knew would be our only salvation .
peter said that he set an example for us to follow .
"but in the church today we believe that the more we obey and sacrifice the more blessing , and health , and wealth we will be showered with ."
god would never expect us to give it all would he ?
when did self - sacrifice come to mean - giving up the things that you do n't want or need .
the <UNK> scream with their lives that self - sacrifice is to give up those things that you desperately need to live .
to spend yourself like money in god 's kingdom until you have nothing left to spend .
maybe this is why the church in america is in decline but throughout the world it is not .
have we sold out some core values that belong central to the faith ?
"and if we have , what is the state of our foundation ?"
do n't know if that is new and revolutionary or old school :)
thought i would start a little online journal while i am searching for jobs and god 's direction for my life .
here 's a copy of the email i sent out in may about my situation ...
"while the timing of this is a bit unexpected , i believe that god led me to <UNK> , and he will lead me on ."
"and during this transition time for me , i greatly appreciate your prayers as i seek god ’s fresh direction ."
"not sure yet , but i still want to do campus ministry somewhere ."
"i love working with college students , and i feel that i have been gifted to do so ."
"i truly believe that god led me here in <#> , and he <UNK> that by giving so much fruit to this ministry ."
and now i believe he will lead me elsewhere - so i am not alone in this at all .
"at the same time , if you know of any leads , please let me know !"
i’m happy to share more if you like - just drop me a line .
urllink <UNK> news - saudi arabia : a house divided
"<UNK> seminar for <UNK> of the seminar , the costs are about php <#> which feeds around <#> - <#> people per day ."
blessing in disguise that only <UNK> <UNK> showed up .
would <UNK> that other <UNK> be about this size as well .
quality not <UNK> . also suggested that <UNK> for youth leaders and possibly <UNK> be encouraged .
however not everyone in the philippines speaks english let alone reads english .
"as a matter of fact , many of the remote <UNK> do n't even read their local <UNK> ."
government <UNK> : philippines borrowed almost $ <#> <#> from the world bank .
<#> % of the current <UNK> budget goes to paying off what is <UNK> on the loan .
"if the <UNK> program works in <UNK> , <UNK> can be used as a model community for building social capital and increasing community capacity ."
usually there are no educational opportunities for <UNK> in <UNK> unless they move to santa <UNK> or <UNK> .
i was informed that there was once a school in <UNK> and that a good road existed however after mt .
"<UNK> 's <UNK> , the school was destroyed and the road was <UNK> ."
the php <#> was split between the <#> <UNK> council members .
they in turn took the php <#> each and split it up among friends and family members they knew they could trust in regards to paying back the <UNK> .
those who borrowed php <#> are expecting to make php <#> at the end of the <UNK> project .
of special interest is an increase of <UNK> that are moving into <UNK> communities .
"<UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> community remotely located about <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
the only non - natural looking structure in the community is the deep well <UNK> in the middle of the village which was installed a few years ago .
there is no school here and i doubt the parents would want them to walk the <UNK> to the nearest <UNK> .
there are no medical facilities here so pretty much they are on their own should an emergency arise .
the residents remember fighting the japanese in the mountains before finally settling at <UNK> .
previous to this there are no records since the <UNK> <UNK> to be <UNK> prior to their need for permanent <UNK> .
many people ( adults and children ) collect <UNK> stones that are used in <UNK> ' stone washing ' techniques .
each bag which <UNK> maybe <#> <UNK> <UNK> a price of php <#> .
illegal <UNK> is also a source of income with many <UNK> collecting around php <#> per tree they chop down .
there is also some <UNK> however i think for most of the people it 's for personal <UNK> rather than an income source .
recently this community received php <#> for <UNK> projects .
this <UNK> will be paid back with interest ( <#> % <UNK> ) .
i 'm curious to see how this ends up .
"in <#> , the local <UNK> communities were involved in a php <#> <#> project funded by the <UNK> ."
which <UNK> failed due to <UNK> issues : <#> ) <UNK> that were supposed to go to community members were instead given to only a few <UNK> .
<#> ) <UNK> that were planted and supposedly that were promised to be bought were n't .
"<UNK> community at <UNK> <UNK> , meeting with some home study participants ."
"they have problems with math , science , and english ."
they are looking for <UNK> to assist them with their questions .
went to <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> village in <UNK> ) and met with the <UNK> council .
noticed a few things and were told a few things . <#> ) no <UNK> human waste .
possible human waste <UNK> due to bare - foot traffic through those same areas . <#> )
again garbage is <UNK> ' where ever . '
<#> ) village states that well water is causing <UNK> .
<#> ) noticed that chemical <UNK> in stream leading from village to <UNK> .
<#> ) <UNK> also complained of <UNK> and other <UNK> problems .
the village is very near clark <UNK> and probably has a history of <UNK> being dropped on them .
garbage is also burned in the community creating toxic smoke .
smoking also <UNK> with adults smoking around young children .
<#> ) educational services have declined in the <UNK> .
interview with kids : the program started in may <#> .
"* regular public school is still expensive for some families that need to buy supplies , transportation , and food for the kids who are attending school ."
* relatively no supplies ( just a work book ) so costs are minimal .
* parents as well as children work in some families so there 's no time for children to attend traditional <UNK> .
suggestion by the kids : * review more often to go over questions and answers in the work book .
* have <UNK> times for reviews so the students can <UNK> their review sessions .
* most problems are with science and english with less concern in math and reading .
the kids fill out the <UNK> and the <UNK> are sent to <UNK> college for <UNK> .
"if the kids pass the <UNK> , they can take a test to rise to the next grade level ."
the <UNK> are definitely a <UNK> society with little to no resources available to them .
in <#> almost php <#> <#> were given to the <UNK> in <UNK> by the united nations for <UNK> development .
leadership classes are scheduled for later this month to go over responsibilities of loan agreement .
<UNK> activity in the location i 'm going to .
the most active being the new people 's army and the the break off <UNK> the <UNK> revolutionary army .
the <UNK> is <UNK> to be funded by the government and that they <UNK> money from the local population .
because of their mixed <UNK> it 's not <UNK> for both groups to clash .
a few months ago about <#> <UNK> were in the <UNK> village we 're travelling to .
for the most part the encounter was peaceful ( the <UNK> were in the village looking for <UNK> water ) .
the <UNK> chief requested that the <UNK> leave which they did .
<#> people died along with <#> civilians . also in the area are <UNK> groups that <UNK> money from the local <UNK> .
the military was <UNK> and drove the <UNK> away but were unable to catch any of the <UNK> .
<UNK> are seen as a ' lazy people ' by other <UNK> .
i asked what they did for fun and they mentioned that they wonder what they will eat the next day .
actually the <UNK> i 've met have been very <UNK>
so i 'm sure this popular <UNK> is <UNK> .
<UNK> explained that the <UNK> live for the present and do not generally have any long term goals .
<UNK> usually stop education after elementary school for financial reasons since access to high school is limited and <UNK> .
"of the <#> <UNK> in the <UNK> region , very few if any have an education higher than elementary ."
they are also <UNK> by the military on <UNK> for weapons and <UNK> weapons the <UNK> use for hunting .
kind of toxic if you think about it with all that plastic being burned as well .
there will be <#> <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> ) .
each village will receive php <#> for their <UNK> projects which will be paid back at <#> % interest <UNK> .
the <UNK> <UNK> : <UNK> at <#> % interest .
"enough in <UNK> to give each family in the <UNK> about php <#> for <UNK> , garden needs , etc ."
local <UNK> <UNK> are actively engaged in <UNK> protection through a grant by the department of <UNK> .
"the grant is <UNK> every <UNK> . the <UNK> plant fruit bearing and <UNK> trees to fight <UNK> , <UNK> , and to protect <UNK> and well locations ."
most <UNK> occurs <UNK> with local government units ( <UNK> 's ) turning a blind - eye .
about <#> <UNK> can be planted in a single <UNK> .
<UNK> ( <UNK> ) is the language spoken by the <UNK> in <UNK> .
additional fruits that are <UNK> are sold for extra income .
<UNK> naman po ang <UNK> mo <UNK> nasa <UNK> ka lang ?
= what do you do when you stay at home ?
adult <UNK> think about what they will eat tomorrow .
fortune <UNK> still hunt for <UNK> 's gold in the mountains around the <UNK> communities .

other concerns are possible deep and shallow well projects for the <UNK> communities .

thought for the day : <UNK> is the better part of <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> : over <#> rural <UNK> in the area .
education level for these <UNK> 's rarely <UNK> primary school level ( if educated at all ) .
no <UNK> population reservations exist in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ) .

many have access to non - <UNK> river water that is currently being used maybe be <UNK> with chemicals and/or <UNK> .
"therefore , the <UNK> foundation has <UNK> the <UNK> of several wells to support rural <UNK> <UNK> who have currently <UNK> water sources ."
clean sources of water are important for increasing community capacity because it <UNK> issues concerning poor health .
would be interesting to conduct a before and after health survey to see if the deep wells made any health <UNK> on the lives of the <UNK> <UNK> .

"okay , not much since i 'm overwhelmed on how much i need to <UNK> ."
"suffice to say , if you 're really interested you may enjoy my observations ."
so i 'm sure anyone should be able to follow along .
"that 's enjoy the notes , not as in ' enjoy !"
most ( if not all ) live in small houses on private owned or government owned land and face the <UNK> of <UNK> .
"many homes are <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> - created <UNK> , <UNK> tin <UNK> , and plastic <UNK> with no window covers ."
the main concern of the parents as well as the children are those of income : <#> ) an increase in their <UNK> from the foundation .

some of the children work on the weekends and after school already which <UNK> the amount of quality studying time needed for their courses .
the public school system in the <UNK> is also stressed .
"although public , tuition and books must still be paid by the students ."

i ca n't say i did n't see the potential .
his home was a modest little place ... <#> could even say <UNK> .
"but the building , and whatever charm that managed to peek through , it was n't mike ."
"no , mike was <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> with nothing but a broken tv , a sleeping bag and a fish tank so <UNK>"
you wondered how anything could possibly live in it .
the sleeping bag was indeed the only <UNK> in the house .
the kitchen table was defined only by the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> that literally <UNK> each room .
days and weeks worth of <UNK> meals that had <UNK> themselves to <UNK> as though <UNK> on for dear life .
in fact he held onto that place as if it were his life ...
"like it was some sort of security blanket "" just in case "" ."
why is it that we always seem to ignore the biggest flags of all ?
the ones that wave frantically from the very top of the flag pole ? the ones that flash like <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> rage ?
"we 'd only been married a few months ... <UNK> , in fact ."
we should have been on top of the world .
but the <UNK> glow of a love struck groom soon gave way to the <UNK> <UNK> of a drunk .
it was midnight when i got home from work .
"as much as it disgusted me , i was not surprised by the empty house ."
it had been happening more and more frequently in the weeks following our wedding .
by now it was <UNK> for him to <UNK> in at <#> or <#> in the morning .
"but as the clock saw 4:00 and 5:00 come and go , my anger <UNK> as i became more and more concerned ."
"i made phone calls to family , friends , police and hospitals .... and i worried ."
"i had spent the night <UNK> the floor , wondering if mike had finally become another <UNK> ."
i was beyond angry ... beyond hurt ... beyond tears .
"i was in full blown panic when the police called at 9:30 to say they 'd found mike at the home of his brother , matt ..."
the only <UNK> i did not have a phone number for .
matt was also an active alcoholic ... and did n't have a phone ... go figure .
it was just after 11:00 am when mike came <UNK> in .
he wore his self righteous arrogance like a <UNK> as he <UNK> into the <UNK> .
we had dated for nearly a year before we decided to get married .
how on earth did he manage to keep this secret ?
"his face <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> expression , finally settling on a most self righteous <UNK> ."
""" i did n't do nuthin ' wrong "" ."
"funny , i could n't seem to think of <#> thing that had been right with the last <#> hours or so ."
i had worked an <#> hour shift the evening before .
the ride home found me tired and so looking forward to <UNK> up with my new husband and relaxing the days <UNK> away .
"i was physically and emotionally exhausted and , in a few hours , i had to leave for work again . """
would it have killed you to let me know where you <UNK> ... that you were n't coming home ?
"still laughing , he pointed his finger in my face . """
"i saw red ... and i wanted him to see it , too ."
the reality of that moment hit me hard as well .
i had been abused ... and now i was <UNK> .
"mike just sat there , stunned , holding his face ."
he pulled off his wedding ring and threw it across the room .
it 's been awhile since i posted an entry .
i saw <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> tuesday night .
it is the funniest movie i 've ever seen .
i learned what a <UNK> is ( part lion part tiger ) .
we 're going to see it again on saturday ( this will be the 4th time this week for the <UNK> ) .
we will definitely buy the dvd when it comes out .
i had lunch with a co - worker at <UNK> 's today .
i got the <UNK> and <UNK> chicken without the chicken .
the waitress looked at me like i was a little strange when i placed my order but i did n't really care .
i 'm thinking about changing the cut and color of my hair .
the last time i tried to go darker my hair ended up green .
i will definitely choose a better salon this time around .
i saw some good shark shows on the discovery channel this week .
"there is a movie called "" open water "" coming out in august that is supposed to be very good ."
it 's based on a true story about <#> <UNK> who came to the surface only to realize that the boat had left them .
i would n't handle such a situation very well .
"well , i need to go put on the rice ."
we 're having chinese take - out for dinner tonight .
i have the day off tomorrow and i should be happy but i 'm feeling kind of down .
i 'm also bothered by the sandy <UNK> <UNK> .
this man should be arrested and put in prison for stealing those highly classified government documents .
the fact that nothing has been done about it as of yet is very disturbing to me .
the husband and i are on a quest to cut back on the money we spend eating out .
dinner is n't a problem because we would much rather eat dinner at home than in a restaurant .
and i like knowing exactly what i am eating .
"i do n't have a problem paying for indian food , chinese food or mexican food because i ca n't make it taste like that ."
but i have a hard time paying $ <#> for pasta at a restaurant when i can make it at home for half of that amount .
i love the smell of fresh garlic and onions <UNK> in olive oil .
the experts say that the number <#> reason married couples fight and get divorced is money issues .
"thankfully , the <UNK> and i see eye to eye when it comes to <UNK> ."
when i eventually built up my <UNK> to $ <#> i thought i was rich .
i wish i would have known the husband back then and he could have taught me how to invest that $ <#> .
he 's very smart and well - informed about money matters .
i think he would be a great financial <UNK> .
"i have n't seen everybody since that day at <UNK> 's and matt was n't there so it was n't an official "" family gathering "" ."
", well , it 's been so long i ca n't even remember ."
"if you 're reading this family , we need to get together soon ."
i wonder if the brother - in - law is still lifting the weights .
i 'm really enjoying the sister - in - law 's blog .
i 'm still laughing about the vegetable <UNK> website and the picture of the apple left to die alone on the grocery store floor .
"well , i gotta go put some <UNK> <UNK> on the north star that has appeared on my chin ."
i noticed the <UNK> made a post on his blog about our opposing views on gun ownership .
i believe it is a wise thing to have a gun in the house with all of the criminals running <UNK> in our society .
to be <UNK> is to be a potential victim .
"the husband was stabbed , beaten and left for dead ."
it turns out that the husband had a shotgun .
the <UNK> wo n't be <UNK> and <UNK> anyone else .
i 'm hardly a match for a man of any size ( except for maybe a small child ) if he had evil on his mind .
i never give such things a thought when <UNK> is home .
but when he goes out of town i hate it .
when we first moved here it was really bad .
i usually ended up at my parents ' house because i could n't get any sleep .
i 've asked the husband if i could get a gun and he said no .
he 's afraid i 'd shoot him . not likely .
i 'm not an idiot - if i heard noises i would grab the gun and wait for the person to come into the bedroom .
by this point you might be wondering where my fears come from .
"well , when i was <#> years old we were robbed ."
i stayed home sick that day but i 'm quite certain i really was n't sick .
"anyway , i heard <#> male voices downstairs and i was terrified ."
i hid under my bed and prayed that they would n't come upstairs .
"that incident , coupled with way too many horror movies , has caused me to battle fears when i am home alone ."
"remember my "" piece of plate in the <UNK> that cracked my tooth "" incident ?"
"well , i had the crown put in place about a month ago and thought everything would be dandy ."
"well , there is an area that hurts like you would n't believe when i hit it with the <UNK> ."
i called the dentist today and he said to give it a little more time .
he does n't want to do a root canal unless it 's absolutely necessary .
i just want to be able to brush my teeth without fear that i will hit that spot .
i know the husband wishes i would stop talking about it .
i figured i would talk about it here and spare him .
our cat who <UNK> a baby <UNK> seal appears to have gotten even bigger .
i do n't think he 'd take kindly to a <UNK> .
he 'll put forth a little effort when i get the stick with the <UNK> on it out but he tires easily .
"i stopped feeding him any <UNK> food and he eats all natural , indoor - only cat food that is supposed to prevent <UNK> ."
supposedly it contains something that <UNK> the <UNK> and keeps cats from getting fat .
"anyway , maybe i should take him to the vet to see if he has a <UNK> problem or something ."
we 're going to have veggie burgers and <UNK> fries for dinner .
i 'll tell you why this election is so important in a minute .
bush <UNK> thomas - republican - nominated by george <UNK> .
bush david <UNK> - republican - nominated by george <UNK> .
just because they belong to the republican party does n't mean they hold conservative views or vote <UNK> .
<UNK> is a radical liberal who needs to be <UNK> .
when the liberals ca n't win at the polls they go to the supreme court to <UNK> their agenda .
"<UNK> thomas , <UNK> <UNK> and william <UNK> seem to be the only real conservatives on the court ."
the fact that these <UNK> are n't getting any younger means that there will likely be several holes during the next presidential term .
if kerry is elected and is given the opportunity to <UNK> a justice or <#> ( and they are approved ) it could be <UNK> .
clinton took the cake with <UNK> - they do n't come much more radical than she is .
"i find it quite telling that only <#> <UNK> did n't vote either way for the federal marriage amendment - yep , you guessed it - kerry and edwards ."
they did n't want to offend any potential voters .
it was n't worth their time to take a firm stand on <#> side of the issue or another .
i honestly ca n't listen to either <#> of them
kerry is the most liberal senator and edwards is # <#> .
.... you do not want kerry in the white house and it 's not for the same reason that hillary clinton does n't want him in the white house .
but that 's a whole other blog entry .
this election is about so much more than the war in iraq .
"but sadly , many people ca n't see past that issue and will vote for kerry in hopes that if he gets elected the troops can come back home ."
that is not the kind of america i want to leave for my children and my <UNK> .
the only sane vote is a vote for bush .
"well , the husband made his best cake ever today ."
he made the second best cake ever last thursday night .
we took several pieces over to my parents earlier today .
"i told mom that they could freeze half of the pieces and she said , "" honey , these are n't going to make it to the freezer "" ."
my grandmother and favorite aunt were in town last week .
my mom made an incredible dinner friday night and we all ate until we were about to pop .
there 's nothing like a <UNK> meal they say .
"i have about <#> meals i cook "" at home "" ."
we kind of <UNK> them so we do n't get tired of any <#> meal .
my aunt bought me a really cool vegetarian <UNK> so i 'll see what i can do with some of the recipes .
"well , after the husband and i dropped off the cake and ate lunch at a <UNK> mexican restaurant we went to <UNK> ."
"besides , there is a <UNK> in <UNK> that i can visit tomorrow ."
"we saw tom cruise 's movie "" <UNK> "" yesterday ."
but i did n't think it was as good as the reviews <UNK> .
i ca n't wait until it comes out on dvd so i can buy it .
"the shark movie "" open water "" opens this weekend ."
<#> of my dreams is to cage dive with some great white sharks .
how cool would that be ? ? ? ?
"anyway , i think i 'm going to take a nap now ."
that 's a nice thing to do on sunday <UNK> .
"my husband had back surgery on tuesday , and i have n't been able to do much of anything except take care of him ."
i have n't had time to even water since monday and i 've been very worried .
the amazing thing was that on thursday morning it rained !
the universe seems to be helping me out .
i did manage to fill the <UNK> yesterday and my younger son has been picking the tomatoes .
i hope i can spend some time in the garden today since my hubby is doing a lot better .
i need to <UNK> and clean up almost all of the flowers and i need to weed the flower beds .
"i also lost some more of the <UNK> , but they are <UNK> , so i 'm not upset about that ."
i just need to empty the pots and store them .
"i also need to mow , <UNK> , edge and sweep ."
all of the chores i 've neglected this week .
<#> appears to be almost pure white and the other <#> are almost pure black .
we will need to be very careful about who <UNK> them .
for some reason cats that are solid black tend to be abused .
maybe it 's the whole historical myth idea that black cats are bad luck or <UNK> ' <UNK> .
fluffy is black with a lot of other colors and i am pretty sure that the daddy is the big yellow tom in the neighborhood .
"this morning we discovered that the stray cat , fluffy , who has adopted us for some reason , has given birth ."
i knew something was up yesterday because she was acting strangely .
"i ca n't see all of them yet because she 's so protective of them , but we think there 's <#> or <#> ."
"<#> are black , maybe <UNK> ; <#> is white , possibly <UNK> ; <#> is a more <UNK> white ... which makes sense ..."
"we think there 's another <#> , but we have n't been able to see him yet ."
the cats also caught <#> of the <UNK> .
i came out to the garden and found <UNK> and down everywhere .
i feel a little guilty because it 's almost like i wished it on him .
"( not the <UNK> <UNK> ) then , my <UNK> came by and helped me <UNK> the <UNK> pile away from the house ."
then we spent some time getting my <UNK> bin <UNK> out .
the big <UNK> was the discovery of some of those plastic cable ties .
they came in really handy for <UNK> the <UNK> to the posts .
when i was putting the <UNK> into the new bin i discovered that some green tomatoes i had thrown out had <UNK> .
"then , he made the big discovery of the day ."
"i apparently have a lot of poison ivy in the yard , some of which i have even been watering !"
i just need to remember ... pointed leaves in groups of <#> . a few days ago
i saw a bird at the <UNK> bird <UNK> with a black <UNK> on his face who was <UNK> on the plastic .
"i 'm not really sure yet because in all of the pictures i 've seen of <UNK> , they have some sort of red something on their head ."
"my <UNK> seeds are <UNK> already , but there is no activity in the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i have looked <UNK> to see if i can find better <UNK> seeds , and <UNK> ."
i think we 're going to have to break down and order some online .
i am also trying to figure out what <UNK> to plant .
"that is going to be a tough decision , but looking through all of the pictures of the various kinds is fun ."
"to have the proper flowers in the spring , you have to plant your <UNK> in the fall before the first <UNK> ."
"so , i have to make a decision and order them soon ."
"i know i want some <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> , but i have no idea about color , variety , height ."
i have n't been <UNK> much the past few days beyond watering .
"so , i spent my saturday morning happily <UNK> ."
"i think i <UNK> it , so i put it in a place less likely to catch water <UNK> ."
i <UNK> the <#> empty <UNK> the <UNK> like and then cleaned the <UNK> <UNK> .
"i just realized that the cold <UNK> recipe seems to be the preferred <#> , so i am <UNK> the <UNK> using that <UNK> ."
my son <UNK> for me this morning and i will edge and <UNK> either tonight or in the morning .
i cut back some of my <UNK> pretty <UNK> last week and they are actually coming back .
i <UNK> them there as a last resort and they are <UNK> .
"they are still producing , but at a slower rate ."
"i seem to be "" hose - <UNK> .... that is ... unable to use a hose without getting it <UNK> ."
i try ... but the hose has a life of its own .
so we put up a homemade hose rack this morning .
"it 's too hot outside to do anything right now , so i guess it 's <UNK> ."
this morning i mostly finished cleaning up my new <UNK> area .
but i also created the <#> <UNK> <UNK> .
i also <UNK> pretty thoroughly around <#> am .
some of the dollar store flower seeds i planted in front seem to be <UNK> as well .
i seem to be <UNK> <UNK> earlier and earlier every day .
audrey name - to - be - <UNK> - later booth was born at <UNK> pm today at <UNK> women 's hospital .

"unfortunately , it 's about the best <#> i have . since i usually end up taking the pictures , i 'm not in that many of them ."
"this is a good thing , since our camera does n't have a wide - angle lens ."
we have a urllink swimming pool in our back yard that 's a refreshing way to cool off on those hot summer days .
"now all we need are some hot summer days , and we 'll be all set ."
here are the girls and a couple of their cousins trying to look happy while freezing on <#> of the typical <UNK> we 've been having .
<UNK> and ethan are their <#> - year - old cousins .
at least i 'm pretty sure those are all the right ages .
they say the mind is the first thing to go ...
"on the friday before independence day , <UNK> had their annual fireworks display in <UNK> park ."
the fireworks came out pretty well for not having the camera on a <UNK> .
i 'll be curious to see if any of these links actually work .
so i found an urllink <UNK> generator the other day and decided to plug my name ( michael <UNK> ) in .
"lo and behold , the first <#> on the list was a chicken helmet ."
"of course , the odds are still pretty slim that i 'll continue to find the necessary motivation , but at least this way there 's a chance ."
a number of ladies have developed shin <UNK> over the past <#> weeks .
please let your mentor know if you are suffering from shin <UNK> and we will work with you to <UNK> them .
rest the <UNK> by pool running or <UNK> jogging for <#> - <#> days if you have access to a pool .
<UNK> jogging uses the same muscles as running and is an excellent way to <UNK> injuries and <UNK> while staying on track with training .
this will require a <UNK> belt available from most pool supply or sporting goods stores ( $ <#> or so ) .
just <UNK> jog in the deep end of the pool for the same length of time you are scheduled to run for .
icing is a wonderful natural way to reduce <UNK> .
this is best done when the injury is <UNK> .
take an over the counter anti - <UNK> medicine such as <UNK> or <UNK> for a couple of days .
soak in a warm bath with <UNK> <UNK> after icing .
the main thing is to rest the area by doing something other than running for <#> - <#> days .
when you resume running make sure you go easy .
stretch your <UNK> per the links below before and after running .
shin <UNK> updated <UNK> sooner or later almost all runners experience pain in the <UNK> or shin .
there are several types of <UNK> injuries that may develop in this region as a result of the repeated pounding from running .
"shin <UNK> , stress <UNK> , and chronic <UNK> syndrome have a common mechanism of development ."
understanding the circumstances that lead to these injuries is the key to preventing <UNK> overall <UNK> theme that leads to <UNK> running injuries is excess training with inadequate recovery .
excess and inadequate are relative terms and must be judged against <UNK> usual training routine .
the more that excess and inadequate <UNK> from the usual training routine the less time it takes for an <UNK> injury to develop .
each foot - strike <UNK> a <UNK> that travels up the leg .
this energy must be absorbed by the <UNK> system .
the harder the running surface the greater the <UNK> .
"soft grass , smooth dirt , <UNK> , and concrete represent , in order of increasing <UNK> , the usual spectrum of commonly encountered running <UNK> ."
they help absorb shock and <UNK> efficient energy ( motion ) transfer .
"matching the type of running shoe to the <UNK> specific <UNK> , and proper shoe fit are important ."
"similarly , worn out shoes should be replaced early because of reduced shock <UNK> capacity ."
both tend to develop shin <UNK> term shin <UNK> refers to a painful condition that <UNK> along the inside ( <UNK> edge ) of the shin ( <UNK> ) .
"the usual location is along the lower half of the <UNK> , anywhere from a few inches above the ankle to about half - way up the shin ."
"<UNK> , this represents a spectrum from mild to severe ."
the pain will often return after exercise or the following morning .
"as the injury <UNK> the athlete will experience more time with the pain , and less time without it ."
"eventually , if ignored and training continued , the pain may become quite sharp and may focus on a very small area of the bone ."
if this happens a stress <UNK> should be <UNK> treatment for shin <UNK> is rest .
depending upon <UNK> it is often necessary to completely stop running for a period of time .
generally this is done until day - to - day activities are pain free .
when running is <UNK> <UNK> and this is where many injured runners make a mistake <UNK> it must be significantly different from the routine that lead to the injury .
the concept of relative rest <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> between training as well as <UNK> the volume and intensity of training .
"<#> can often substitute cross - training activities ( e.g. , <UNK> ) for running to help increase the <UNK> between running days ."
however the most important <UNK> strategy is not to repeat the mistakes that lead to the injury .
"examine all the training <UNK> <UNK> surface , shoes , training volume , intensity , workout type , hills , weather conditions , etc ."
"this all takes time and effort , but it is well worth it ."

by now the <UNK> drugs are likely <UNK> from my system .
"as i write this on saturday evening , i find that i am feeling better ."
"outside of some body aches , minor headache , and a little hint of <UNK> , i came through this pretty well ."
i 'm not sure if all of the side effects are from the <UNK> or from the shot i had to self - <UNK> yesterday .
previously <UNK> has been <UNK> in <#> week <UNK> because it took <#> weeks for a body to build up the blood counts again .
"through the miracles of modern medicine and a drug called urllink <UNK> , it is possible to build your white blood cells and have <UNK> in <#> week <UNK> ."
i had to learn how to self - <UNK> the <UNK> .
"after years of giving my mom <UNK> <UNK> , i just have to apologize to her ."
"because my mom has never complained , i just thought it was a pretty <UNK> procedure ."
luckily i just need <#> after each <UNK> treatment .
"the phone calls , cards , emails , and comments on this site lift and carry me ."
the <UNK> ’s office always has an impact me .
there is such a range of experiences and emotions for everyone there .
the patients in the waiting room tell a story with their eyes .
there was a woman there with her <#> children .
<#> was a <UNK> and the other was probably around <#> .
she was giving him instructions to sit nicely and wait patiently while mommy went in to talk to the doctor .
he couldn’t come in because the doctor needed to tell mommy something .
just then i said a prayer for her and for her fragile little family .
the <UNK> room reminded me of the television room at a fire station : a line up of <UNK> and a nice television set .
of course this room was a little more <UNK> and had an <UNK> of medical supply <UNK> and iv stands and <UNK> .
"there were plenty of <UNK> little stuffed animals and craft items <UNK> the room and a selection of magazines , books , and videos ."
most striking were the eyes of the patients and their family members .
<#> woman across the room had a look of quiet desperation mixed with pain .
“ would this work and is it worth it ?
he daughter <UNK> <UNK> her feet and hands while the woman <UNK> <UNK> off .
the woman next to me had enough energy and a smile to light the room .
she was in las vegas feeling great when suddenly she became very <UNK> .
when they finally diagnosed her she was stage <#> <UNK> cancer .
she said she wouldn’t know there was anything wrong with her if the doctor didn’t keep telling her .
the man down the way kept talking to people about his involvement with his catholic church .
it seemed be the thing in his life which made him most proud .
"when someone would talk to him or tell him he looked familiar , he would say it must be from church ."
it was obvious his faith put that smile on his face and gave him the strength he needs right now .
another woman came in after obviously crying all the way to the office .
she went into a private room to lay down and get her treatment .
another woman was so afraid to make eye contact with anyone .
she didn’t want to look at us or be seen with us because then she might be looking at herself –
i had that look my first visit to the office .
it was <UNK> off with a photo of her proudly wearing a graduation cap and holding a diploma .
"if her smile could heal , we could have all left early ."
"it would be followed by stories of <UNK> , treatment , side effects , and helpful tips ."
"as much as our <UNK> are separate and distinct , we weren’t there alone ."
"... i do n't know when i 'll be back again ... """

i 'm in a new york state of mind today and so not motivated to write much here .
"if you 're looking for something to read , go check out urllink <UNK> 's awesome review of "" garden state . """
"i saw a screening of "" without a <UNK> "" tonight ."
"sometimes you 've just got to go to nyc , you know ?"
""" garden state "" opened in limited release today ."
it 's <#> of the best films of the year and needs to make a ton of money .
"that would have caused a <UNK> in the space - time <UNK> , i can assure you ."
i rode my horse and slept way more than i probably should have .
"i did get <#> movies seen though , so i guess put that in the "" productive "" column ."
"so , as promised last week , i 'll do the movie review thing seeing how it 's monday and all ..."
"well , i saw "" the clearing "" and "" before sunset . """
"all - in - all a decent flick , but <UNK> not <#> that will end up in my dvd collection ."
"urllink "" before sunset "" was the better film ; totally character driven ."
"i saw "" the bourne <UNK> "" last night ."
i loved the first film and this <#> was even better .
matt <UNK> does a great job <UNK> his role as jason bourne and the supporting cast ( especially karl urban ) are excellent as well .
"if i had to pick <#> reason to recommend this movie though , it would have to be for the <UNK> car chase near the end of the film ."
it is some <UNK> footage that is edited near perfectly .
definitely the best chase sequence to ever hit the screen .
"( yes , even better than the ones in "" <UNK> "" and "" the french connection . "" )"
"so , go see "" the bourne <UNK> "" this weekend ."
"it will give you something good to watch until "" garden state "" goes into wide release :)"
"today is brought to you by the letter "" v . """
why is it that all of a sudden i seem to be going to movies that put me into an <UNK> kind of funk ?
"maybe i 'm just entering the "" blue period "" of my life , you know like <UNK> or something ."
"anyway , i saw "" de - lovely "" last night ."
"overall , not a bad flick , but it wo n't be winning any awards or anything ."
"kevin <UNK> was great as usual and the music was outstanding , but the film itself can probably best be described as "" <UNK> . """
"<UNK> said she found it "" oddly <UNK> "" and i totally agree ."
"it was short - lived and all seems right with my world by the light of day , so who knows ?"
maybe there was just something in the air last night ...
urllink <UNK> this site is horribly <UNK> and time consuming .
i highly recommend it ... nothing else to report today .
i 'm actually trying to be semi - productive @ work ;)
i 'm thinking that normally mondays will be movie review day for me .
"i watched "" return of the king "" again ."
"<UNK> and i have a trip to nyc coming up at the end of the month , so at least things look to pick up a bit then :)"
<UNK> <UNK> and i keep the coffee bean <UNK> of the world in business .
( if you do n't know who urllink <UNK> <UNK> is then you should sooooo not be reading my blog . ) that 's it .
"- flash <UNK> for everyone who shares this illness with me , i found the above quote on a cool page that is all about about coffee : urllink <UNK>"
"that 's what i 'm in the mood to post today , so poetry it is ..."
"wow , i can do anything i want here on the blog ."
it 's sorta like ruling my own little country .
california dreaming every time i come back here i remember why i left .
the happy press of the bubble - headed masses does nothing but distract me from my <UNK> - ian journey .
"my soul is here , no matter how many times i say it isn’t"
out here on the fault - line of my life they look pretty much the same .
"i don’t want to leave , but at the same time i can’t get away soon enough ."
i think the sun has finally fried my brain .
"dig the shake <UNK> and roll , <UNK>"
hi gang ... just sitting here wondering what i should write about .
"i can either kill a few minutes and tell you about the mundane <UNK> i have to do , or tell you something interesting ."
"the most exciting thing i can tell you about , is that i have <#> sons ."
he has been selected to travel to the sunny land of iraq shortly ... pray for him and all of our soldiers .
"my second son , has major las ( lazy <UNK> syndrome ) ."
he 's graduating this coming june ( i hope ) and still <UNK> and <UNK> on whether or not to join the air force or army .
"no , these are the paths they have chosen in their lifes journey ."
number <#> son better soon make up his mind ... time is running out ...
<#> years of high school left to go .
"as for number <#> son , he should become a <UNK> or politician ."
he has so much <UNK> with him he keeps me in stitches .
the crazy boy had the school nurse believing he was attacked by some small furry creature that jumped up and attacked him in the woods last year .
i was wondering why the lady was calling me ...
i told her not to believe what comes out of his mouth until she asks me first .
how many kids do you know that will trade their teacher <#> of their shoes for a pencil ?
"yes , he did give the pencil back at the end of class and <UNK> his shoe ..."
"as <#> number <#> , his view on life is that schools should be banned ."
"by sending kids to <UNK> : prison ) , parents are being cruel and <UNK> ."
"do n't worry , he will be released by the year <#> ."
i can say that the last <#> years they 've been great ( and my husband included ) .
he works hard everyday by supporting our butts by building houses .
this past may i graduated from college earning a bachelor 's in history .
"i 'm a <UNK> alpha <UNK> ( history honors ) , and get excited by dusty old stuff that has a past history ."
"you think i 'm bad , you should see the gang i hang out with ."
"our last outing was to the national <UNK> in washington , dc ."
"<#> of the younger members in our group , on occasion , practices by playing on the <UNK> organ ."
the architecture of the building is awesome as well as the stained glass windows ...
this days i am trying of create my own <UNK> .
"i am using the program "" urllink font creator "" ."
a very good program who give all the functions that i need to create my <UNK> <UNK> .
i am reading <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> de <UNK> .
a tale of <UNK> ( de <UNK> did a lot of these ... ) and the effects of it on the family .
the ending is a lot like a <UNK> tragedy ( urllink <UNK> )
"yesterday i saw a mexican tv program conducted by "" <UNK> <UNK> "" called "" urllink <UNK> <UNK> "" he interviewed a "" carlos <UNK> "" a real <UNK> ."
he lived a case of possession and now he is trying to help to another people who live situations like this .
"he explains his story in the book "" urllink <UNK> "" ."
if you want to know about him you could see his site urllink <UNK>
"i got this <#> also from <UNK> <UNK> , and i think it is very inspiring stuff !"
learn how the <UNK> <UNK> urllink strange <UNK> - an animation <UNK>
we have just had the <UNK> football with its surprising winner greece .
surely a good greek <UNK> this year as it has only just started .
even people <UNK> football will be <UNK> why do we do that ?
i think that media consumption is getting more and more <UNK> and we liked that .
"to have our own communities of interest , our own very special sites ."
"we want something to talk about , some common ground ."
"football is such common ground , the orange clothes tell us we all belong together as we support "" our "" team ."
"the <UNK> of terrorism , the growth of religion <UNK> ( and i mean christian as well as islamic ) made the world a less safe place ."
"we want to be safe , it is a very basic need ( remember <UNK> , the second level of needs ) ."
we want to feel bound to a save group .
we look for <UNK> in something that <UNK> the difficult religious or political discussion . and football as many other sports is able to just do that .
"a <UNK> approach would be to <UNK> this feeling , to establish more common ground ."
"to <UNK> the feeling you belong to that group , where you will be safe ."
"<UNK> should not be <UNK> on <UNK> individual differences , but group <UNK> and <UNK> ."
<UNK> got me on track with someone who off course is of great importance to studying <UNK> communication .
i would like to meet him <#> day.. urllink henry <UNK>
"i just "" met "" <UNK> on the internet and i think she is doing some very interesting work ."
i feel there is parallel thinking going on here .
i met <UNK> on the <UNK> conference in march in manchester this year where she invited me to speak on <UNK> at the conference .
urllink this link will tell you more of <UNK> in <UNK> and their <UNK> research
"the website of <UNK> where you can find information on the conference and speakers from the <UNK> industry , gaming industry and the <UNK> as microsoft and bt ."
i was there to discuss about <UNK> and i met some interesting people .
"as i just started this <UNK> blog , <#> of the first things that came to my mind was , can people interested in this subject find me ."
so i am stepping into the subject of rss and feed burning .
i will let you know how i see this <UNK> our ability to cross communicate with each other .
"so i can better make you find me if you want to know everything there is to know about <UNK> communication , which i plan to offer to you ."
this makes it possible to transform from <#> - <UNK> communication ( <UNK> - > <UNK> ) to multi - <UNK> communication ( <UNK> <UNK> .
the level and depth of involvement will be more personal and therefore more relevant and powerful .
my work is currently much related to retail communication .
this is because retail is now able to use ip based services to its own advantage .
a couple of years ago the <UNK> were told they would get <UNK> because of the <UNK> .
meaning that the brick and <UNK> shop would get <UNK> in favour of us buying everything on the internet .
some products and services will be mostly internet based and the brick and <UNK> will get rare to <UNK> .
"the brick and <UNK> music store will become such a rare species , the traditional <UNK> is another <#> ."
but at the same time a pure <UNK> company such as apple is <UNK> in high profile <UNK> in every important town centre .
it means that when you need to explain features of your product it is good to get in touch with your customers .
"but mostly if you want to play a role in peoples lives you have to be there , in their places of worship ."
the function of a store for a customer is not about buying products !
every <UNK> is dreaming of getting his store or products into places of worship .
he/she wants to influence his image to the customer . but how to do that best ?
<UNK> applications are getting more intelligent in the store .
"the publicity of <UNK> <UNK> is a sign of this , although i fear another <UNK> development here , it is <UNK> an interesting <#> ."
currently i am working on a pilot to develop a service for <UNK> to actually ' see ' what people do in their stores .
"the <UNK> they take , the time they spent , the places they attract to and the ' dark places ' that are not working for the store ."
"this information helps the <UNK> to better design his store , but also to plan and design his <UNK> communication to be most effective ."
now you have the possibility to <UNK> interactive possibilities that the internet can give in a real environment .
"mixing the real with the virtual , to <UNK> the story you are telling ."
"how will it influence the <UNK> of a better life , more comfortable , more <UNK> , more in style ?"
i was pretty tired yesterday so i decided to listen to my body and take an extra rest day .
"<#> miles <UNK> , not too hot , fairly pleasant run ."
<#> degrees and sunny was nice weather to run in .
"knees felt ok , legs a little tired at end , <#> <UNK> taken at miles <#> ."
"yesterday was a nice day off , i did n't get the <#> calories like i said , maybe <#> ."
today 's swim was harder than it looked on paper .
"it took me about an hour and a half for <#> <UNK> , some pulls , catch - ups , kicks and <UNK> along with some breast strokes ."
"broke my strap on my <UNK> , luckily i had my <UNK> with me ."
"form seems to be comming back , i worked on sweeping my catch during warm - up ."
"right hand is good , left hand needs some work ."
"<UNK> , i am so beat from the weekend . <UNK> off at <#> pm last night and slept straight through to my alarm this <UNK> ( <UNK> ) ."
"i need this rest day , after work i 'm going to eat <#> calories and go to sleep at <#> pm ."
saturday starts with a medium distance swim at spring mill pond with norm and <UNK> .
"<#> laps , <#> miles , then <#> miles on the bike in about <UNK> and followed by a <#> mile run ."
"<UNK> kept me company on the ride , it was a long day ."
that was my first <UNK> and i wanted to know what it felt like to run afterwards .
"i really felt pretty good , surprising ! ! !"
"sunday i rode with <UNK> cycling club , <#> easy miles followed by a <#> mile run ."
kind of tired on the run so it was cut short from <#> miles .
went to dinner at dad 's house afterwards and worked on his computer .
"<#> miles on the bike in <#> degree weather , it does n't get much better than this . the warm sun on my skin makes me feel great ."
"put on lots of <UNK> and drank lots of <UNK> , <UNK> of water and <UNK> ."
"i think i will swim tomorrow at lunch , it 's only a half an hour , then speed work on the track ."
"weather channel says a high of <#> tomorrow , a drastic change from yesterday and today ."
! almost <#> degrees . started out easy and hr went up to mid <#> 's
early so i went with it keeping the same pe .
kept the hr there and the pace started to slow so i picked up the pace to average <#> <UNK> for the whole run .
"average hr was <#> <UNK> , not as high as i expected ."
got home and did n't have time to cook dinner to i went to taco bell .
"next weeks run will be <UNK> and i will run to hr instead of pace or pe , well , maybe pe ."
"i might ride with roman tonight , do n't know how his <UNK> is"
"oh , i <UNK> forgot , my knees are feeling much better ."
i read that during the <UNK> that you should land on the outside mid - foot then roll to your ball of your foot then to the toes .
i worked on that instead of just landing mid - foot and it works much better .
"<#> <UNK> , <UNK> , kind of tiring , i went pretty hard and i 'm still looking for the form i had a month ago ."
"this pool at <UNK> 's is slow , at least the water was a bit cooler today , i 'm guessing <#> <UNK> ."
"even though i am tired i have a sense of accomplishment after this swim , my left shoulder does n't hurt and i swam hard to the end ."
got to get lot 's of rest cuz tomorrow is a long run day .
"oh yes , lance took the yellow jersey today ."
my mom was so depressed yesterday because the insurance did n't really cover her <UNK> costs .
she wo n't even check out <UNK> shops because she 's decided she does n't want the stuff back .
"there were really only <#> pieces that mattered : her mom 's <UNK> ring , her sister 's ruby ring and her grandmother 's <UNK> ."
l and i saw the ' home at the end of the world . ' interesting flick .
"a few people walked about at the first "" gay "" scene ."
really it was n't that <UNK> sexual but a lot of <UNK> .
colin <UNK> did an amazing acting job and i almost always like <UNK> <UNK> .
"it starts in <#> and this <#> - year - old kid <UNK> his pot - smoking , crystal - <UNK> - taking brother ."
"his brother has a bad - ending but in a sad and expected way , and the kid sees it ."
"eventually his parents die , and as a teenager he lives with his best - friend 's family ."
he grows up into this very pure - hearted type of person .
"it was a <UNK> of a period in his life , without an obvious point or conclusion ."
"at least , l and i have n't figured it out yet ."
it was a fun evening ending in ice cream and good thing to do since i still ca n't go to <UNK> .
kelly wanted to throw me a more traditional party but i am too old for that .
she thinks i am a big dork and wo n't come to the <UNK> party .
i think it will just be l and the <UNK> .
really fucked up my foot and knee yesterday at <UNK> .
not sure how long it will take to heal up but i hope not too long .
<UNK> using <UNK> but they are more trouble than they 're worth .
we are probably going to see the home at the end of the world tomorrow night .
an <UNK> film with colin <UNK> . should be good .
"yesterday , as we were driving to <UNK> , a stray dog came running out on to <UNK> ."
"he came in front of my car , so i stopped and hit my <UNK> ."
"i <UNK> to scare him off , but it did n't <UNK> him ."
so i <UNK> my car door and he jumped in .
"we pulled into the house he just walked by , but the owner had n't seen him before ."
so we took him to my parent 's house and tied him up out back .
we called him stray dog and he turned out to be the best stray dog ever .
"he was so ugly he was cute , and all <UNK> but that was ok too ( not <UNK> , just <UNK> ) ."
on the down side he was definitely part pit - bull .
we taught him to sit and lay down in the afternoon .
mom and i were very taken with stray dog but i think dad and paul were less <UNK> .
"anyway , animal protection picked up stray dog today and they hold him for <#> days before turning him over to the <UNK> society or some equivalent ."
he is so friendly i am sure someone is looking for him .
wish i could keep him but i have a dog and <#> cats already .
so my parents house was broken into yesterday and robbed .
"the <UNK> took pretty much everything ... dvd , computer , jewelry , but not furniture etc ."
"on the up - side , this thief was n't overly <UNK> ."
"he did n't smash things for no reason , and he did n't hurt the dog ( a little white puff ball ) ."
at least i understand the thief who <UNK> for money .
i do n't get the <UNK> kind at all .
is it that the energy around them is so great that others are <UNK> drawn to and affected by them ?
i would like to figure out my spirit animal but have n't had time to sit down and do it .
very <UNK> because it is things like ' cleaning house ' that are taking up time .
"i have been <UNK> down my <UNK> moments things like driving along and i think there 's a cop ahead , or there are donuts in the <UNK> ."
these times are like an idea pops in my head out of nowhere so strongly that i know it 's right .
i am taking friday off to go hiking in canada - should be quite wonderful and i hope the weather stays nice for it .
having some good conversations about <UNK> and all things <UNK> ( my <#> favorite topics ! ) with a uk native .
trying to fit it all in between work and people coming into the office .
it 's neat when you can connect with someone so far away .
he gave me a list of things to understand some of the things i see when <UNK> so i am anxious to get home and try it out again .
i am moving back to the other house soon - and am not really looking forward to it .
i have a pattern set down at the house i am trying to sell and i will miss it .
"i have plenty of time in the evenings for doing me - things , and that wo n't be the case when i move back ."
my future mother - in - law is spending a week with me at my house .
she is trying to be good about letting me get about my business .
i do miss spending time at the other house now though .
l and i chatted on the phone for quite a while - it was a nice <UNK> from chatting with my <UNK> only .
i am spending too much time on the forums lately .
they are very interesting though and i enjoy reading them .
"my foot , ankle and knee are a bit closer to getting better ."
i ca n't wait to get back to <UNK> .
"i will probably miss testing this month though , because of the injury ."
i do n't have much to talk about but felt i should keep my log up .
"l got a <UNK> with a <#> "" <UNK> monitor - very nice ."
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> - i mean , omg i went to the <UNK> on friday ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
he was <UNK> of my <UNK> because he let us through then .
i walked around the beach and even went in the water ...
i made friends with a little <UNK> there ... very nice <UNK> .
"<UNK> blew me off a little at the beach , but i 'm not offended ."
he likes the waves way more than me .
after that my owner tied me up so i <UNK> a lot .
"they ate lunch and i tried to get some , but she is tricky that way ... putting her food on the table and not letting me up ."
we walked <#> cool paths and ran into a bunch of people .
i <UNK> some at a german lady - she understood i was just doing my job .
actually it was her son i was barking at - he looked a little shady .
he kept <UNK> around and passing us so i figured it was a challenge .
then i <UNK> and shed a bunch in the kitchen - hehe .
so i did n't have a chance to nap .
i ran around the kitchen some and <UNK> some stuff .
"the other day though , i could have killed my owners ."
the she - <#> comes down and starts opening all sorts of good smelling stuff - not the least of which was beef !
she put it in a bowl and left as usual .
then the most wonderful smelling stuff came from the bowl .
all day i was driven insane but good smelling beef . all day ! ! !
i jumped up a lot but could n't reach the bowl . when they came home they did n't apologize or even share .
but i <UNK> my tail and ran around because i forgot to be mad at them .
a number of ladies have developed shin <UNK> over the past <#> weeks .
please let your mentor know if you are suffering from shin <UNK> and we will work with you to <UNK> them .
rest the <UNK> by pool running or <UNK> jogging for <#> - <#> days if you have access to a pool .
<UNK> jogging uses the same muscles as running and is an excellent way to <UNK> injuries and <UNK> while staying on track with training .
this will require a <UNK> belt available from most pool supply or sporting goods stores ( $ <#> or so ) .
just <UNK> jog in the deep end of the pool for the same length of time you are scheduled to run for .
icing is a wonderful natural way to reduce <UNK> .
this is best done when the injury is <UNK> .
take an over the counter anti - <UNK> medicine such as <UNK> or <UNK> for a couple of days .
soak in a warm bath with <UNK> <UNK> after icing .
the main thing is to rest the area by doing something other than running for <#> - <#> days .
when you resume running make sure you go easy .
stretch your <UNK> per the links below before and after running .
shin <UNK> updated <UNK> sooner or later almost all runners experience pain in the <UNK> or shin .
there are several types of <UNK> injuries that may develop in this region as a result of the repeated pounding from running .
"shin <UNK> , stress <UNK> , and chronic <UNK> syndrome have a common mechanism of development ."
understanding the circumstances that lead to these injuries is the key to preventing <UNK> overall <UNK> theme that leads to <UNK> running injuries is excess training with inadequate recovery .
excess and inadequate are relative terms and must be judged against <UNK> usual training routine .
the more that excess and inadequate <UNK> from the usual training routine the less time it takes for an <UNK> injury to develop .
each foot - strike <UNK> a <UNK> that travels up the leg .
this energy must be absorbed by the <UNK> system .
the harder the running surface the greater the <UNK> .
"soft grass , smooth dirt , <UNK> , and concrete represent , in order of increasing <UNK> , the usual spectrum of commonly encountered running <UNK> ."
they help absorb shock and <UNK> efficient energy ( motion ) transfer .
"matching the type of running shoe to the <UNK> specific <UNK> , and proper shoe fit are important ."
"similarly , worn out shoes should be replaced early because of reduced shock <UNK> capacity ."
both tend to develop shin <UNK> term shin <UNK> refers to a painful condition that <UNK> along the inside ( <UNK> edge ) of the shin ( <UNK> ) .
"the usual location is along the lower half of the <UNK> , anywhere from a few inches above the ankle to about half - way up the shin ."
"<UNK> , this represents a spectrum from mild to severe ."
the pain will often return after exercise or the following morning .
"as the injury <UNK> the athlete will experience more time with the pain , and less time without it ."
"eventually , if ignored and training continued , the pain may become quite sharp and may focus on a very small area of the bone ."
if this happens a stress <UNK> should be <UNK> treatment for shin <UNK> is rest .
depending upon <UNK> it is often necessary to completely stop running for a period of time .
generally this is done until day - to - day activities are pain free .
when running is <UNK> <UNK> and this is where many injured runners make a mistake <UNK> it must be significantly different from the routine that lead to the injury .
the concept of relative rest <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> between training as well as <UNK> the volume and intensity of training .
"<#> can often substitute cross - training activities ( e.g. , <UNK> ) for running to help increase the <UNK> between running days ."
however the most important <UNK> strategy is not to repeat the mistakes that lead to the injury .
"examine all the training <UNK> <UNK> surface , shoes , training volume , intensity , workout type , hills , weather conditions , etc ."
"this all takes time and effort , but it is well worth it ."

"<UNK> will soon be making an appearance at the <UNK> county <UNK> , sometime in late september ."
"there will be no pictures taken or <UNK> signed , nor will mr ."
"what is new with francis <UNK> , you ask ?"
"i will answer pitiful ones of less fortune , for i am francis <UNK> , which puts me at liberty to discuss myself , francis <UNK> ."
"my desert tour went , how do you say , really great !"
"<UNK> , white racist <UNK> that go to <UNK> meetings and beat <UNK> have brought charges against me for what they call "" burning down a house ."
""" i call it "" spreading the grace and wisdom of <UNK> , through the use of <UNK> ."
""" i was un <UNK> , the worst city in , how do you say , the world ! for ice cream"
"i was flying back to germany is a <UNK> of dance , when i felt the need for <UNK> , and order the <UNK> bird of flight to land !"
"the city of <UNK> calls it a fire <UNK> , i call it <UNK> !"
"i will <UNK> with your souls , yah , because i am <UNK> god francis <UNK> , and all will <UNK> with my dance ."
"be lucky <UNK> , because while <UNK> in las vegas i will post in this blog , yah ."
after i leave las vegas i shall travel my native <UNK> of <UNK> and spread the dance to my <UNK> brothers .
"get your <UNK> yah , because all shall <UNK> with my dance and shake the sand from their shoes ."
"then i am off to the <UNK> , germany , where i am teen idol , <UNK> god francis <UNK> ."
i 'd have more than <#> place to turn .
it turns out that most people do n't have that .
the <UNK> has certainly not worn off in the last <#> hours .
hopefully soon i 'll be able to bring the funny .
"dear big cheese of <UNK> , here at team <UNK> we know that a job description is a jumping off place ."
the members have the opportunity to stretch their limits and use all of their skills .
sometimes ones we did not even know we had .
", it is time for me to bow out <UNK> , for my own good as well as that of the team ."
"please let this serve as my <UNK> , perhaps in the future i can assist the team in another capacity ."
"sincerely , the chick who is crying in the bathroom every day"
trusting myself enough to know that if i want to do it then it 's worth trying .
i 've wanted a blog for a long time .
i <UNK> between thinking i 'd be good at it and wondering why i 'm so damned interested in the lives of people i 've never met .
everyone and their dog has a blog these days .
if i like this i 'll have <#> pretty soon .
<#> for here and <#> for events that will link to my web site ( <UNK> ) .
"and , particularly for this <#> , it does n't matter if i 'm good at it ."
"and , if all they say is true , i 'll get better at it the more i try ."
"right now , no <#> knows that i have this ."
at least for the next few minutes no <#> even has a way to search for me .
stories and ramblings and opinions without back up and <UNK> and who knows what else .
a start . a way to get over the first tough step .
a pile of boxes and bags probably <#> feet long and <#> feet high at least .
"i do n't remember what we were talking about , because what could we be talking about ?"
"life as we knew it was moving . and this family comes along , <#> women and i think <#> kids , elementary school age ."
they saw the couch and the living room chair and they were considering taking them home .
"l and i , desperate for our <UNK> home not to be thought of as useless and <UNK> , proceed to sell the items ."
"not for money , i mean , but tell that family how comfortable and how easy to carry ."
"more importantly , not knowing at all if the wife would recognize me if she saw me ."
"thinking about it now , it 's embarrassing and ridiculous ."
so later that night we 're getting into the car .
"uncle j driving , mom in the passenger seat and me behind her ."
"so i 'm sitting there and mom says , "" j , i 'd like <UNK> to have mom 's rings ."
"i mean , after all , it might be the only diamond she ever gets ."
"i mean , who could have refused that pitch in honor of my pathetic <UNK> life ."
i did n't realize quite how pathetic and <UNK> until mom pointed it out .
and i 'll bet a dollar that if i told that story to my mom she 'd tell me it never happened that way .
"so , how did i spend my friday night , completely exhausted and in a fog from the work week ?"
"odd , but i finished a story that i started earlier this week ."
"for once , i actually did pull myself out of bed , turn the light on , and <UNK> down some notes ."
"tonight i finished it , after realizing i wanted to do it from the points of view of the <#> main characters involved ."
"so yeah , saying i 'm "" finished "" does n't mean much ."
"it means it has a beginning , middle and an end ,"
"it needs editing , <UNK> , thinking through if it really makes sense , red pen surgery --"
but it 's in much better <UNK> than you get sometimes .
"it 's amazing , how sometimes a story just sings ."
you can tell the difference between <#> your heart got into and <#> that is awkward and may never know where it 's going .
"which reminds me , i have another that i have started and abandoned ."
i usually do n't start another story till i 'm done with the first .
it might tell me that other <#> just does n't have the muse .
"is it depressing , this <#> that just got "" done "" ?"
i think this <#> pretty much lives a life of its own .
"on that note , i 'm totally exhausted after a rather unexpected night of <UNK> ."
so today i am commenting on an older issue of <UNK> . who says i 'm not a little <UNK> ?
"<#> , which happens to be the 20th anniversary issue , which by my <UNK> , means it 's the <#> issue ."
how much has changed in a few short years ....
"well hell , <#> sounds like just yesterday , but it 's actually been a long time , now has n't it ?"
"anyway , starting off with the <UNK> section , there 's an excerpt from a book by <#> of jack <UNK> 's wives , joan <UNK> <UNK> ."
"let 's face it though , it 's kind of all gossip and <UNK> , but fun to read . )"
"a great piece was the flesh made word , by nick cave , the musician from bands the birthday party and bad seeds ."
"( you know , "" jesus <UNK> without a board "" --"
"as a consequence my words <UNK> with a nasty , new energy , "" he said ."
"i highly recommend the essay , it was interesting and certainly not even close to what i expected ."
"interestingly , the poems in this volume do n't do it for me like the ones in the other issue i read , no ."
"i kind of wonder if it has something to do with <#> , and what was still going on in the poetry world then ."
"most of them struck me as more <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
"however , there were probably <#> or so poems i enjoyed , including more from <UNK> straw , who was also published in no ."
"i just started on the fiction section , and will report on that later ."
"a friend of mine turned me onto a site called urllink strange <UNK> , a site that <UNK> in <UNK> fiction ."
steel yourself for the possibility that <#> of your stories might fit the criteria of what they definitely do not want to see !
"anyway , from <UNK> around on the site , there 's a lot of neat stuff there ."
"i read a random <UNK> of stories , and especially enjoyed the <UNK> for love , by ken <UNK> ."
"even if you 're not a writer who <UNK> in sci fi , fantasy , or <UNK> fiction , i think it 's worth a look ."
"all the names have been changed to protect the innocent , "" that sort of thing . of my body of work"
", about half are pretty closely based on real - life experiences or people ."
"at some point , the characters tend to take on lives of their own ... <UNK> <UNK> lights on people than perhaps they deserve sometimes ."
"i guess he did realize that regardless , it 's a good thing to be <UNK> in print . )"
"recently , i got <#> older story published that was so close to truth that i ended up <UNK> ."
"it was probably <#> of the most ironic events of my life , really ."
"how a certain character <UNK> might have <UNK> , given a situation ."
"anyway , i have definitely wondered what other writers feel about this ."
"fact vs. fiction , and the <UNK> shades in between ."
"but then , i 've wondered if they might feel sold out ."
"so , this is just a post about a question that i have no answer to ."
"and if anybody has any thoughts , please comment or email me"
", i would imagine it 's a common question ."
"when you 're a writer , <UNK> has to be your middle name ."
"( some might call it stubborn , or hard - headed , or <UNK> , or what have you . )"
"i always knew i wanted to be a writer -- before i could read or write , i would sit and <UNK> pages and pages of <UNK> ."
"( that 's either <UNK> or me being a really crazy kid , i 'm not sure which . )"
"when i was in the 5th grade , <#> of my teachers , who was actually very supportive , asked what i wanted to be when i grew up ."
"so anyway , if there are any <UNK> writers out there who are tempted to quit because they got <UNK> , do n't give up ."
"we all get rejected -- many , many times ."
-- there 's the old joke of <UNK> your walls with them .
most people are not the lucky few who get their big breaks in high school or college .
"and , if you get any sort of personal rejection -- take that as a real sign that your story is good , and you have talent ."
"seriously , if someone takes the time to give you encouragement or make feedback , then they see something there ."
that had to serve as justification for a little more of a decade to come -- <UNK> <UNK> as opposed to form <UNK>
": "" thank you but we ca n't use this "" being standard form -- those personal <UNK> became a weird sort of victory ."
"sometimes , it may be years that that 's the best you can do ."
i do happen to have a happy outcome of the last <#> years .
"i 've gotten <#> of my short stories accepted and published in the last year , by internet literary magazines ."
"despite many years of doubt and wonder if there was any point to the struggle , i did receive some degree of justification ."
i 'm just hoping it wo n't be another <#> or more years before i see more literary success .
i 'm hoping this is the start to an <UNK> <UNK> .
writers who have been at this for a while know about the importance of being stubborn .
"so anyway , like i said at the beginning , i 've seen too many new and promising writers get frustrated and give up too soon ."
"so , having finished the fiction section of <UNK> , it was basically all so great"
there 's really no point in listing out every story that rocked the house .
"<#> is a good bet , if you like <UNK> , <UNK> stuff that 's free of conventional <UNK> ."
the new nose by steph <UNK> and <UNK> vs. alice cooper by <UNK> <UNK> were also awesome .
"so , there , i 've teased with a few worth <UNK> but the full fiction section is really about <#> pages of literary delight ."
"see my last post for more on this issue of <UNK> , as i began with the poetry -- again"
"thanks for reading , and write on , <UNK>"
but it 's that exciting to share immediately .
"i got my hands on <UNK> , no ."
"<#> , and so far , it 's everything i feel a literary magazine should be ."
this <UNK> <UNK> off the demons of convention and <UNK> .
"<UNK> was started in <#> , you can view its history here : urllink <UNK> ."
"so , it was a pleasure to run across it once again -- apparently it was on <UNK> for a spell during the ' 90s ."
"<#> through <UNK> , though i suppose with a little more effort i could have found it carried <UNK> , since it 's operating from my <UNK> ground ."
"<UNK> ; and "" fashion magazines , "" by <UNK> su ."
"and , there 's a great <UNK> : "" i should have been <UNK> , "" and "" gay italian man , "" both by <UNK> straw ."
"those are just my favorites , i give gold stars to most of them ."
"and i 'm saving the part <UNK> of this post for the fiction section of the magazine , which so far , has been blowing my doors off ."
"so anyway ... thank you <UNK> ... for the focus on sharp , dark wit , irony , <UNK> , and disregard for the flat conventions of yesterday ."
( and it 's full of those post - it flags i mentioned in my last post ! )
"well ladies and gentlemen , the project to raise funds to replace the van that was stolen and destroyed last weekend has ended as quickly as it has started ."
"i am happy to say that this story does , indeed , have a happy ending !"
i just received the following news item in relation to the project : fm <#> <UNK> come through !
monday morning <UNK> and donna each <UNK> $ <#> towards the cost of replacing the vehicle and fm <#> <UNK> were quick to follow suit .
over $ <#> had been <UNK> by noon monday .
<UNK> ford heard about the cause and is <UNK> a completely <UNK> wheelchair accessible vehicle for the family .
thank you to all the big hearts out there who made a <UNK> to this effort .
all dollars <UNK> have been placed in trust for the family .
"so , the <UNK> will have a new fully accessible wheelchair van and will have $ <#> in trust as well to help them out ."
today is a very happy day ! :)
i would like to thank everyone who spread the url for your time and caring .
"again , thanks to everyone for caring and getting behind me in this <UNK> ."
"first of all , i 'd like to wish my dad a happy <UNK> birthday !"
dad turns <#> on thursday july <UNK> and we are all looking forward to sharing some birthday cake with him !
"here 's wishing you a great day , dad and many more to come ! secondly , i want to <UNK> your help ."
this is very important and i am hoping that each and every <#> of you can help in some way .
this van was a wheelchair - accessible van and was worth over $ <#> and the insurance on the van does not cover theft .
"to make matters worse , the van was found a couple of days ago and had been <UNK> and was completely destroyed by fire ."
"now , this <UNK> old mother has no way to get her child to doctor 's appointments and just to get out anywhere ."
"she can not even afford a car , let alone a new accessible van ."
"let me make something clear , i do not know this young lady or her son ."
i was just very much <UNK> to hear that someone could do something so evil that affects a disabled child .
i feel the need to try to do something to help .
the method i have chosen to help is to create my own website <UNK> people can donate money to help purchase a new van for this child .
the money will be handled by me and every penny <UNK> will go directly towards the purchase of a new wheelchair accessible van for this child .
i have created a <UNK> <UNK> button on my website that people can easily use to make a <UNK> .
"so , you 're probably wondering how you can help ?"
"well , you can help in a couple of ways ."
"first of all , you can make a <UNK> ."
i know many of you can not afford to donate money so the second option is critical .
i would appreciate it if all of you could forward the url of the website to as many of your friends and family as possible .
please inform them that this is a legitimate appeal and that you know the person directly who has created this page .
"the internet is a huge community and if this thing is put out there .... potentially , millions of people can see the website ."
"if only <#> % of those <#> people were to donate $ <#> , then we would easily reach our goal of $ <#> !"
it can happen and you can help make it happen !
"so , please please please , pass this url along to anyone and everyone you think would be interested in seeing it and ask them to pass it along ."
every little bit will help and i thank you very much in advance .

a number of ladies have developed shin <UNK> over the past <#> weeks .
please let your mentor know if you are suffering from shin <UNK> and we will work with you to <UNK> them .
rest the <UNK> by pool running or <UNK> jogging for <#> - <#> days if you have access to a pool .
<UNK> jogging uses the same muscles as running and is an excellent way to <UNK> injuries and <UNK> while staying on track with training .
this will require a <UNK> belt available from most pool supply or sporting goods stores ( $ <#> or so ) .
just <UNK> jog in the deep end of the pool for the same length of time you are scheduled to run for .
icing is a wonderful natural way to reduce <UNK> .
this is best done when the injury is <UNK> .
take an over the counter anti - <UNK> medicine such as <UNK> or <UNK> for a couple of days .
soak in a warm bath with <UNK> <UNK> after icing .
the main thing is to rest the area by doing something other than running for <#> - <#> days .
when you resume running make sure you go easy .
stretch your <UNK> per the links below before and after running .
shin <UNK> updated <UNK> sooner or later almost all runners experience pain in the <UNK> or shin .
there are several types of <UNK> injuries that may develop in this region as a result of the repeated pounding from running .
"shin <UNK> , stress <UNK> , and chronic <UNK> syndrome have a common mechanism of development ."
understanding the circumstances that lead to these injuries is the key to preventing <UNK> overall <UNK> theme that leads to <UNK> running injuries is excess training with inadequate recovery .
excess and inadequate are relative terms and must be judged against <UNK> usual training routine .
the more that excess and inadequate <UNK> from the usual training routine the less time it takes for an <UNK> injury to develop .
each foot - strike <UNK> a <UNK> that travels up the leg .
this energy must be absorbed by the <UNK> system .
the harder the running surface the greater the <UNK> .
"soft grass , smooth dirt , <UNK> , and concrete represent , in order of increasing <UNK> , the usual spectrum of commonly encountered running <UNK> ."
they help absorb shock and <UNK> efficient energy ( motion ) transfer .
"matching the type of running shoe to the <UNK> specific <UNK> , and proper shoe fit are important ."
"similarly , worn out shoes should be replaced early because of reduced shock <UNK> capacity ."
both tend to develop shin <UNK> term shin <UNK> refers to a painful condition that <UNK> along the inside ( <UNK> edge ) of the shin ( <UNK> ) .
"the usual location is along the lower half of the <UNK> , anywhere from a few inches above the ankle to about half - way up the shin ."
"<UNK> , this represents a spectrum from mild to severe ."
the pain will often return after exercise or the following morning .
"as the injury <UNK> the athlete will experience more time with the pain , and less time without it ."
"eventually , if ignored and training continued , the pain may become quite sharp and may focus on a very small area of the bone ."
if this happens a stress <UNK> should be <UNK> treatment for shin <UNK> is rest .
depending upon <UNK> it is often necessary to completely stop running for a period of time .
generally this is done until day - to - day activities are pain free .
when running is <UNK> <UNK> and this is where many injured runners make a mistake <UNK> it must be significantly different from the routine that lead to the injury .
the concept of relative rest <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> between training as well as <UNK> the volume and intensity of training .
"<#> can often substitute cross - training activities ( e.g. , <UNK> ) for running to help increase the <UNK> between running days ."
however the most important <UNK> strategy is not to repeat the mistakes that lead to the injury .
"examine all the training <UNK> <UNK> surface , shoes , training volume , intensity , workout type , hills , weather conditions , etc ."
"this all takes time and effort , but it is well worth it ."
"related stretches the urllink <UNK> muscle stretch ( gif <UNK> ) and the urllink the <UNK> stretch ( <UNK> <UNK> ) copyright <#> <UNK> mark <UNK> , md"
"obviously we would prefer the murder option , but knowing the directors are <UNK> themselves is a reasonable alternative ."
"anyway , all the best <UNK> and marie with your new contracts , your new <UNK> gain is most definitely this shit tip 's loss ."

yesterday was day <#> of the summer holidays for my kids .
my son ( <#> ) is threatening to run away from home because he hates us all ( why do you hate us ?
i think it 's because he 's grounded until saturday morning .
he 's grounded because i found a packet of my cigarettes in his pocket .
and i do n't think a a <#> hour <UNK> makes me the worst mother in the world .
"when people ask me why i hate summer so much , i know i do n't need to ask them if they have children ."
i 'm a bit <UNK> and its only <#> .
<#> advantage to being very old and on a diet !
i went to visit my friend <UNK> yesterday evening .
"i do n't see her as often as i should , but then she does n't come and see me either ."
"we had lots of catching up to do , must be around <#> months since i last saw her ."
"and i got round to <UNK> her christmas present , too ."
on the way to the supermarket yesterday we passed someone flying a <UNK> .
"i 've never been tempted before but this time it looked liked fun , and i said so ."
( how come i have no idea about the contents of my house ? )
so we decided we would go fly a <UNK> when we got back .
"our attempts were <UNK> , it kept falling apart ."
"if i was n't shouting at her , she was shouting at me , but i really enjoyed it ."
"now i am glued to ebay and hoping my bid of £ <#> will get me that easy - to - fly <UNK> , only an hour to go ."
i 'm also watching some more impressive ones and might indulge in <#> of those too - or maybe not .
"you see , i 'm well aware that if i do buy a <UNK> then our windy valley will become the <UNK> place on earth ."
"nope , it 's the items i buy that are changing the climate ."
"so , i 've managed to read <#> whole pages in the equivalent of <#> working day ."

its <#> pages long and i 've been trying to read it for <#> days .
"i 'm on page <#> , but i think i read <UNK> at least <#> times ."

"i think i saw <#> that was <UNK> amusing , whilst he read several out loud between <UNK> with laughter ."
do i have grounds for an official complaint regarding my director 's completely <UNK> sense of humour ?
this morning i was listening to npr on my way to work .
they interviewed a couple that supported george w. bush .
they asked them what they thought about their kids supporting kerry instead .
"the immediate response from the mother , the mother for christ 's sake , was that they were stupid ."
can you believe <UNK> <UNK> to me what i dislike most about many ( not all ) conservatives .
they choose their party over even their own family .
they do not try to understand the other side of things .
they lack imagination to put themselves into other people 's shoes .
i 'm sure those people would consider themselves christians as well .
how is anything the republicans are doing christ - like ?
giving money to close - minded religious organizations has nothing to do with christianity .

"in the winter months we sit out on the deck , sipping wine , burning stuff in the <UNK> , and discussing all things philosophical , political , <UNK> ."

"we both have an <UNK> to television , believing that too much television <UNK> away a person 's imagination and sense of self ."

"her blue sofa and all the plants on <UNK> day while <UNK> <UNK> listened to tool with closed eyes , <UNK> heart ."
those became days where a <UNK> ate rat poison and <UNK> <UNK> goo <UNK> with <UNK> black <UNK> bad news all over .

ron is my oldest son who was not living at home when this journal began .
"he is <#> now , and moved back in last year when his marriage to kim ended after <#> years ."
<UNK> is my youngest daughter and is now <#> .
when i began this journal she was living with her husband mark and their <#> kids - andrew and alyssa who are <#> and <#> .
"since this was written she also had twin girls , morgan and madison ."
<UNK> is living at home now also . and so begins my journal of <UNK> .... journal of insanity <#>
i have had probably <#> people in the last <#> weeks tell me i should keep a journal of my life .
i think this is crazy because i do not see it that way at all .
i see it as incredibly stressful and as a <UNK> mechanism i write to friends and bitch .
then i get back letters that say things like <UNK> letter was so funny ” and
“ your house has got to be the funniest place to <UNK> ” the problem with this is that i am not being funny .
i do not see much that goes on in a humorous light .
my husband recently suggested this might be the cause of the headaches i’ve had .
so i have decided to follow the advice of my former friends and keep a journal .
"it seems to me that i have become a victim of my own life , rather than the captain of my ship ."
this may be because i spend all my time putting out fires instead of figuring out what is causing the fire to start with .
dogs are very intelligent creatures and always have <UNK> for their actions .
"granted , most of these <UNK> have to do with <UNK> either ours or theirs and then the <UNK> of that food on my <UNK> ."
"but they have other thoughts as <UNK> love and hate , fight and play , hunt and gather , and <UNK> like the animals they are ."
"the fish are okay , they rarely do anything to stress me out ."
"their biggest issues are their stink but really , they can’t do anything about that ."
"after getting off to a rocky start <#> years ago , we hit the ground running and have been madly in love ever since ."
"fred is the perfect husband ; <UNK> , kind , generous , <UNK> and a great lover ."
( you never know if he is going to read this and we do have to cover all the <UNK>
my ex - husband ( a whole other <UNK> ) had a stack of <UNK> magazines under his side of the bed .
"our bedroom is filled with model cars ; you name the car , it 's in our bedroom ."
i used to feel like those cars were watching me with their <UNK> little <UNK> .
i had bad dreams about them coming to life in a ‘
<UNK> kind of way and i would be found dead in bed from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"our , or i should say , his garage is packed tight with cars and car parts that will probably never again see the light of day ."
"the worst thing i can say to fred is , “"
"gee honey , let 's clean out the garage ."
"i used to argue , then i <UNK> but i have given up ."
you need to accept a person ’s limitations .
so that pretty much describes my sweetheart . except for <#> thing .
fred ’s way of dealing with stress is to stress me out .
he will never just go into the hallway and bang his head against a wall .
"he bitches , he pisses and <UNK> at me like"
i am not experiencing the same damn stress he is and i can do something about it .
he corners me in the car - filled bedroom and just rants and <UNK> .
i need to figure out what to do about these episodes .
"our son michael is not only highly organized , he is very self - <UNK> ."
"many might see this as a great quality in an <#> - year old kid , but to me it is a pain in the ass ."
if mike brings home a paper that has to be signed and returned the next day he will nag me <UNK> to sign it .
he refuses to go to bed until it is signed and then put in his backpack .
he doesn’t understand that the more he <UNK> me the longer i will put off signing it .
i’m the kind of mother who likes to sign things as kids run out the door .
it gives my signature that <UNK> that you just can’t get while sitting at a table or leaning on a counter .
i was the kid who ’s dog always ate my homework so i ca nt even begin to relate to this side of my son .
"i like him best when he is all <UNK> and <UNK> , or when he is a typical pain in the ass kid ."
he couldn’t care less if the teacher ever gets a form back signed unless it <UNK> with his playground or snack time .
he is god ’s way of showing me i had pushed my luck too far by having <#> kids .
"after <#> semi - normal children , i got aaron !"
sorry its been so long since i <UNK> things have been getting away from me lately .
"i like to pretend this is out of the norm , but in reality , i am usually in a state of chaos ."
"as i 'm writing this , mike is on the phone yelling to andrew over and over - "" it 's your birthday <UNK> happy birthday andrew . """
either andrew has been struck deaf on the morning of his 4th birthday or he is just not getting it .
someone should have explained the whole happy birthday thing or he is going to wonder why people are shouting at him all day .
it may even cause him to grow in to the kind of person who hates birthdays .
"but , as i keep telling fred , this is n't my problem ."
the kids are adults now and what they do is their business .
if <UNK> and mark want to keep andrew in the dark concerning his birthday i am going to mind my own business .
hopefully i can talk fred in to <UNK> his own business .
"anyway , while mike was yelling at andrew , aaron was running around the living singing "" happy birthday to andrew "" as loud as he was able to ."
"that , combined with the television blasting , was a little overwhelming to me ."
since i know it is impossible to get aaron to shut up i turned down the tv .
imagine andrew 's horror when aaron took the phone from mike and started the happy birthday song all over again at the top of his voice .
"kids who are <#> do not understand the concept of "" <UNK> ."
i swore for years i did not come in to the world that way .
"i was sure i had been a <UNK> baby , because the alternative was just downright <UNK> ."
of course this was n't the kind of thing i could ask my mother .
words such as <UNK> were never spoken in my home .
we knew because we had never heard the words spoken .
and we witnessed the terribly awkward silence that would meet a visitor who spoke those words .
i raised my kids to be mature about such words .
we are all determined not to raise our kids the way we ourselves were raised .
"when my kids and i needed to talk about sex , we just came right out and said fudge ."
"if anyone we knew had sex , they had made fudge ."
they loved going over to her house and staying with her for weekends or even weeks .
i am going to have to call <UNK> and tell her that it is very easy to explain birthdays to a <#> year old .
i have been getting a lot of feed back about aaron lately .
amber told me he called her cell phone repeatedly <UNK> when she didn’t call him back he made <#> last effort to get her to <UNK>
"it went like this : "" amber , this is aaron ."
i have been calling you and you haven’t called me back .
i need to talk to <UNK> followed by high pitched <UNK> )
"<UNK> , amber , my eye is bleeding , my eye is bleeding . """
then aaron 's normal voice <UNK> you call me back please ?
""" then there is the whole money begging thing going on ."
aaron is no longer allowed to use the i m feature of aol .
it seems he used my screen name to <UNK> video game funds from my friend <UNK> .
"he said "" hi , i need <#> bucks . """
"there was also the time in <UNK> when he went with his brother , ron , to buy a pair of shoes ."
"aaron wasn’t really bothered by the guys <UNK> at all , but his brother was pretty <UNK> about the whole thing ."
here is the first chapter to a book that i 've written .
"if you would like to read the whole thing , send me an e - mail and i 'll send you a <UNK> ."
"also , you will probably be able to tell that it has n't been edited ."
a basic breakdown ( left v. right ) iv .
arguing with a <UNK> v. you are not alone <UNK> .
<#> ’s activists x. gen x <UNK> .
second class <UNK> or minor <UNK> ( everyone else ) <UNK> .
the press ( even though they are now right wing according to the democrats ) <UNK> .
the constitution and how liberals <UNK> it <UNK> .
"conclusion disclaimer : i refer to <UNK> , liberals and democrats with a very broad brush in the following text ."
"please keep in mind , this is a <UNK> not specifically <UNK> at all <UNK> ( just most of them ) ."
"i actually have some good friends that are as far left as you can get , and they actually do , gasp , like me ."
"we have <UNK> debates and generally agree to disagree , so mike don’t get mad at me i still love you but not in a gay manner ! ! !"
"don’t worry , the above was not meant to be some sort of “ politically correct ”"
statement so liberal ’s feelings won’t get hurt .
i just want to make sure you know that i refer to these groups in a variety of ways !
"if they don’t want their feelings hurt , they need to put this book down right now and walk away !"
"i’m a bad ass , and i pull no <UNK> !"
i. introduction a quick note before we get started with the first chapter .
"my dad is going to retire this summer , and my mother is in the process of sending me many of my high school and before memories ."
"i was something of a <UNK> in my younger years , so i got stuff like old notes from family and old girl friends , etc ."
have you ever read notes from old girlfriends ?
my daughter will not be allowed to date until she is <#> .
"<#> thing that i got , i had completely forgotten about , and i think you may like this story ."
"as i was going through my box of memories ( and wishing i was young again ) , i stumbled upon a picture holder from an old wallet ."
"didn’t have but a couple of things in it , but <#> of the pictures sent me to the floor with laughter ."
in that plastic picture holder was an <UNK> photo of richard nixon !
it was actually a picture that i had cut out of a magazine and <UNK> myself .
i remember laughing to myself as i cut the picture of ‘ ol dick taking a swing at a golf ball .
"i would show it to my friends and <UNK> that dick ’s not such a bad dude , he did open up china and all ."
"want to make some of your fellow liberal friends mad , just carry around a picture of nixon ."
i looked at the picture again and just smiled .
"when i cut this picture out , i was just beginning to walk down the path of <UNK> ."
"i was <UNK> , and confused at the fact that i knew more than my parents did about life !"
i was also beginning to form my opinions about my country and my political ideology .
"as you read on , and you think i’m getting to deep or you think i sound like i’ve been smoking crack , think of nixon ( <UNK> ) !"
"<UNK> when i was in college , i knew better than most of americans ."
"i believed in <UNK> action , welfare , etc ."
i would go on and on about how these causes where noble and how anyone that didn’t believe the way i did was either wrong or just plain stupid .
"i voted for anne <UNK> ( democratic governor of texas ) , and i even took place in some political activities at school ."
"i was <UNK> superior , and my ideas ( even though they where not rooted in research or fact ) where superior to those right wing thick headed <UNK> ."
who was going to stick up for the little guy ?
"let ’s hear a real big , hell no ."
the only people that would stick up for these poor folks where people like me .
arrogant college students that knew more than my parents ever would .
i knew darn well that the right wing would not care .
all they cared about was screwing the little guy and trying to pay fewer taxes .
"around my senior <UNK> ) , i think , i began to grow up ."
i remember being in the library at stephen f. austin state university .
"i can’t remember the book , sorry , and i’m not going to waste my time trying to find it ) ."
“ what is this guy thinking ? ? ?
"if it wasn’t for the left wing , the indians would be on their own without any help from the government ! !"
lord knows that they would not be able to take care of themselves ! ! ! ”
i had to put the book down for a moment .
i pushed back my chair and began to think hard about the beginning of this chapter .
"i had only read the <UNK> not his reasons , but in my mind how could an indian ( a minority for god ’s sake ."
"okay , a native american ) make such <UNK> !"
"i looked around the floor and for a moment watched dozens of fellow students reading , sleeping and studying in groups speaking in whispered tones ."
"i guessed that no <#> else had read the book , or they would be putting a hand on my shoulder and say “"
"don’t worry dude , they just don’t get it . ”"
"to put it in a nut shell , he went on to discuss how indians where treated like children ."
how could they grow as a people if they constantly had people telling them what to do and how to spend their hand - outs .
they would rather go without the hand - outs and determine their own destiny than have a group of <UNK> telling them what to do .
it was at that moment that i had a thought of total clarity : “ maybe i’m wrong ? ”
“ am i a ( oh god ) a right <UNK> ?
whoa let ’s take <#> step at a time .
that chapter in that book made so much sense to me .
i began to re - evaluate my political thinking over the course of several months .
"i remember thinking to myself reagan was a good president , and my professors thought he was the anti - christ ."
"i also began thinking about things like welfare and other social programs , and my mind started to slowly change ."
“ why did we need the government to do all these things ? ”
i had to leave the comforting <UNK> of <UNK> and go get a job .
i worked as a waiter for the first <#> months out of the gate .
"finally , i began working for enterprise rent - a - car as a manager <UNK> ."
i remember getting my first paycheck in the mail and being so excited ! then there was an “
oh <UNK> when i opened the envelope that had my pay check in it .
standing in the po boxes of my apartment i was stunned .
"so stunned in fact , i remember dropping the envelope that my paycheck came in ."
"“ boy , they take a lot out for taxes ."
my political though began to mature to the right .
"i can understand paying my fair share , but this was a bunch of <UNK>"
i actually started to open my mind and think .
listen to what the politicians where saying and more importantly what they where doing .
i began to listen to the news media and how they where <UNK> stories .
i moved from a protected <UNK> <UNK> in college to a working american that started to realize that freedom is more important than <UNK> .
that is what has made our country so successful ! over the last several years
", i have kept up with my political <UNK> ."
i love to participate in our political system .
"election night is <#> of my favorite nights of the year ( except <#> and <#> , but i did like <#> ! ) ."
i have shaped my political <UNK> over this time .
i look back at my college years with some <UNK> .
i mean i did have a great time drinking beer with my <UNK> brothers and keeping the debate ( as wrong as i was ) alive .
"this is why i’m sitting here at my , well my company ’s , lap top right now ."
"currently , our country is at war in iraq . being the political <UNK> that i am , i’ve been <UNK> to the war"
i keep thinking about my college days when i was always right regardless of the evidence .
"furthermore , i watch these politicians from the left <UNK> out , in my humble opinion , <UNK> un - american rhetoric ."
how can an educated person think that way ? ?
"i’ve seen the light , why can’t everyone ? but being a right <UNK> , i must respect their freedom to be wrong ."
this is a very subjective and completely un - scientific analysis of the left .
this is my humble opinion of these groups .
if you are looking for <UNK> or first hand knowledge read any other book that has been written by a professional writer whose job it is to write books .
"i’m writing this in my spare time ( and even some time that i can’t spare ) ,"
so what you see is what you get !
this is simply meant to be some light reading about our buddies on the left .
liberal into several <UNK> including : • <UNK> •
homosexuals • <UNK> • the average <UNK> citizen • the yellow dog •
radical <UNK> • the french it is very important that you don’t just use a blanket when discussing our buddies to the left .
each separate species has their own agenda and value system .
"some of these species have <UNK> and values that blend over to each other , but be rest assured these are all very distinct groups ."
the common thread is the <UNK> which i call liberal .
i have been torn as to what to call the <UNK> .
understanding the <UNK> liberal is just as important as understanding the wide variety of species .
i will also be covering this common thread in chapter ii .
you could even get some of your right leaning buddies and try and figure out the species of your friends and famous people .
you may be surprised as you read along who fits where .
"finally , i want to give you some tips on how to handle these folks ."
i hope you enjoy the rest of this .
i’m writing this before i write the rest of the book .
i don’t know how it is going to turn out ( or even if i’m going to finish it ! ) .
"liberal okay , let ’s talk about the <UNK> of liberals ."
i think the first and foremost thing that you need to know about liberals it this : they hate you .
you are also to dumb to realized the peace and <UNK> of the clinton years .
"now , you may be saying to yourself , “ boy jack , that ’s kind of harsh ."
"i’m not rich , and i believe in freedom ."
"your ideas are from <UNK> herself ( well , if god can be female – <UNK> for tat ) ."
the liberal thinks of you as a cartoon character .
you can see it in all aspects of the media and these idiots when they describe the people on the right .
they have a perception that the south is <#> alabama .
"i don’t want to get all historical on you , but i have a theory ( hmmmm , next book material ? )"
: i think this hatred comes from the civil war .
let ’s take the slavery issue out of it for a minute .
<#> of the main issue around the civil war was “ states rights ” .
the south believed in a small federal government while the north believed in a strong federal government .
it is the issue that we have been debating since the <UNK> of our republic .
"when the north won the war , the south was <UNK> <UNK> and socially ."
the victor ’s write the history ” the north made the south look like a bunch of slave beating <UNK> that married their cousins .
the little problem with that stereo type of the typical <UNK> is that it isn’t true .
the south has gone through great changes in the past <#> years .
"today , the south is as strong if not stronger than the north <UNK> ."
"the south is growing in population while the north is <UNK> , but look how <UNK> are portrayed ."
the tv show in the early <#> ’s dallas is a great example .
all it will do is keep the republican ’s in power .
"hand <UNK> religious nut : this plays into the stereo type of the <UNK> , but is also applies to the <UNK> too ."
they look at the lower middle class that is religious as a <UNK> in their side .
that is why they so <UNK> try to keep god out of schools .
"with no morals , you make a much better liberal ."
i’m always amazed at the <UNK> the liberal will have when they find out that a person that has religion screws up .
"as president bush says , “ we are all <UNK> ”"
"a true christian realizes that no <#> is perfect , but we must strive to be the best that we can be ."
the liberal on the other hand will take the phrase “ let he who <UNK> the first stone have no sin ” to a new level .
"in the liberal ’s world this means that you can’t criticize anyone for doing anything wrong , and if you do , be prepared ."
you will have every second of your past looked into to try and prove that you are a hypocrite .
that is exactly why they try to <UNK> the religious leaders in this world as snake handling <UNK> .
"even though you are an adult , you want to be accepted ."
"if you are thought of as a crazy because of your beliefs , you will do <#> of <#> things : <#> ."
<#> . <UNK> try and set the record straight .
which they will in turn make you look even <UNK> .
“ i hate the poor ” business executive : this <#> always cracks me up .
they look at everyone that works for corporations ( that aren’t part of a union ) and thinks they are evil .
chances are you or someone you know works for a large company .
think of them when i’m describing how the liberal wants you or your friend to be portrayed .
they see big business as trying to screw everyone .
the funny thing about it is they love <UNK> ’s coffee .
they will get their copies made at <UNK> ’s while <UNK> on ben and jerry ’s ice cream .
"the liberals hate them because they haven’t yet lost the ability to think for themselves ; hence , they must have been taken over by the evil republican machine ."
"now , let ’s look at this in perspective ."
the news media is controlled by the left .
billions of dollars are spent on news and entertainment is <UNK> to the left .
i guess i can see how the left would be confused by the fact that the am radio dial has “ <UNK> ”
"see , the left as we know it today is rooted in the <#> ’s political <UNK> ( who where rooted in <UNK> more later ) ."
hence their “ belief system ” is no belief system .
listen to all these musicians and actors wax <UNK> about how they where going to change the world .
remember the time cover ( i think it was time )
"america sucks , right <UNK> are evil and the military is a bunch of baby killing <UNK> ! ! !"
left <UNK> will never understand the right for the simple fact that they only hang around other <UNK> .
"rush has commented on this , and so have many other sources as well ."
"here is the <UNK> : since the liberal hates the conservative , why would they hang out ?"
how could bush even come close to being elected ?
"when everyone i meet at cocktail parties ( where we smoke <UNK> , but you better not smoke a cigarette ) voted for gore"
? another reason that liberals don’t hang around conservatives is they are sore losers .
", they don’t want to “ hang ” with those jerks that took power from them !"
they would rather plot the demise of the republicans than get to know them .
the democrats are really pissed that <#> - <#> happened .
now keep in mind that people that don’t have the same value system as you do will sometimes try to turn yours around onto you .
<UNK> <UNK> the majority of the social programs that are blowing up today .
"social security , welfare and a wide variety of agencies that have a <#> letter name ."
<UNK> ’s vision was that the federal government would be able to help the country out of the depression .
"it took a little attack on our navy in hawaii and a war to pull us out , but we where left with the crap that was left behind ."
"i might be a right <UNK> , but harry <UNK> was <#> of my favorite presidents ."
in reading his <UNK> i remember that he was amazed how un - organized the government was when <UNK> died . here
throw a bunch of crap against the wall and see what sticks .
let the someone else work it out . back to my point .
<UNK> was the root of the <#> ’s <UNK> .
"<UNK> , he proved that <UNK> doesn’t work , but he is a hero to the left ."
i challenge you to find a liberal that will say anything negative about <UNK> .
i always thought he was <#> of our best presidents until i began to look at his record .
"<UNK> , he gave a <UNK> for <#> of the bullets in the <#> ’s <UNK> arsenal :"
"<#> . if they don’t agree with you , change it ( see supreme court ) and <#> ."
use the courts to change things if congress won’t .
why do you think they are fighting bush ’s <UNK> so much .
i get so <UNK> when i have a discussion with a <UNK> .
"it is expected that if they make a good point that i <UNK> the point , but if i show that they are wrong , i’m an asshole ."
"don’t be discouraged , it is simply a part of life like the sun rises in the east and sets in the west ."
the best defense is not to get your <UNK> <UNK> .
we screw the poor at home and abroad .
"it will <UNK> based on the species , but the theme is common ."
the united states somehow is the root of all the problems in the world .
"now , you may be saying to yourself , “"
"well , let them leave if they don’t like it ” see you are missing the point ."
see how many of these will root back to the hatred of the right .
"in fact , they love it just as long as you are gone ."
"see , the right doesn’t care about the environment , they hate other countries and the poor should be taken out and shot ."
"hey , don’t get your feelings hurt , that is just the way it is ."
"as far as the left is concerned , the usa is the evil place because of the right ."
"when you watch the news or listen to anyone that has their face in front of a microphone , listen carefully to what they are saying ."
"as i said , i’m writing this during the iraq war ."
they where getting ready to ship out to the middle east .
"several basic “ how and why ” questions where asked , then it came ."
flashed up on the screen was a shot of dead kids and she asked the general “
how does it make you feel when you hear of the death of innocent civilians in iraq ? ”
"hey you idiot , this poor guy isn’t even over there ."
"at that point , i decided that abc news lost a viewer forever ."
the military is a completely different issue than the country .
sure you have heard the “ they are our planes now ” comment on rush <UNK> several times .
"as i was driving to the air port tonight , the radio was talking about an <UNK> ."
professor at columbia university ( <#> - <#> - <#> ) said he wanted us to lose the iraq war and hoped for a <#> more <UNK> ’s .
"see , they think the military is the true source of all evil in the world ."
much of that comes from the people that demonstrated the <UNK> <UNK> war in the <#> ’s and <#> ’s .
"i’m <UNK> the draft , how can they honor their commitment ? ”"
"see , it goes back to questioning authority and thinking you are superior to everyone ."
"furthermore , the <UNK> believes that we should be able to resolve our conflicts with words ."
"look , we may be the <UNK> ones , but there are several countries that hate us ( usually for the same reason as the liberals do ) ."
we need to have the ability to defend ourselves .
"sorry , i’m probably preaching to the choir ."
"basically , the hatred of the military comes from the fact that they hate the country , and want us to get our butts kicked ."
geeks in high school this is just a personal observation about our buddies on the left .
i see most of them ( especially the acting community ) as the people that got their butts kicked when they where in high school .
i think that is why they are always preaching political <UNK> .
"it ’s not like i was the most popular guy in high school , but i didn’t let it shape my life ."
high school was a time in my life that i spend growing into an adult .
"unfortunately , many of the actors in hollywood didn’t bother to attend college , and their world view was shaped by their experiences in high school ."
i’m not saying that you have to go to college to have an educated world view .
"i work for <#> of the smartest people i know , and he never went to college , but he also was able to grow up ."
how do you think we ended up with political <UNK> ?
don’t you think johnny would feel better about himself if we told him that it is okay to think that <UNK> is <#> .
"well , <UNK> may equal <#> on the <UNK> world ."
"in reality , <UNK> and i don’t think our children would die if they found that out ."
do you have to be to get so offended by a simple comment ?
"“ well , that ’s not free speech that is hate ”"
"last time i checked , free speech meant you could say what you wanted to ."
the only catch is no <#> had to listen .
"here is an example : i’m watching tv a few nights ago , and they had a <UNK> album thing on vh1 ."
"i’ve got a question , where were all these groups when ice t came out with cop killer ?"
several species in the liberal world got their butts kicked in high school .
"next time you watch cnn and listen to paul <UNK> , <UNK> “ please don’t kick my butt , sir ” may be the underlying theme of his arguments ."
"( writers note : well , well , well , it looks like our friends at <UNK> lost their time slot ."
from poverty to hunger to racism it is never the <UNK> that people have made .
"“ we need to do more ” , etc ."
i’m always struck on how negative the liberals can be .
"so when bad things happen to me , i always see the light at the end of the tunnel ."
the liberal simply sees an <UNK> worker that is digging through the mountain that will never get ahead in life because of the <UNK> of “ the man ” .
how they get through life thinking like that is beyond me .
i’m sure you’ve heard some of the code phrases .
“ how can you be so happy when there is so much suffering in the world . ”
"“ eat all your food , there are starving kids in <UNK> ”"
"i make a middle class wage , and i’m trying to raise <#> kids ."
"i know that there is <UNK> and <UNK> all over the world , but i also know my limitations ."
i don’t let myself suffer because of something that i have absolutely no control over .
"yes , i will have an opinion , but i don’t lose sleep over the fact that <UNK> ’s civil <UNK> is causing global warming ."
"as i say , listen to what is said ."
they are really just trying to make you feel guilty .
do they propose to solve the problem with personally taken action ?
"no , they want to complain about how bad it is ."
“ let ’s tax the rich and bill clinton will fix it . ”
a major component of the left ’s argument is emotion .
"really , how can you be against clean air and water ?"
do you really think <UNK> should be shot ?
don’t you think we should have peace and love thru out the world ?
"here <#> to think about : • the <UNK> fathers never <UNK> assault weapons , we need gun control ."
"well , i bet the <UNK> fathers never <UNK> <UNK> movie <UNK> either , but you will defend their right to be under free speech !"
the left has become very good at wrapping their issues around emotions .
think of the war the we are currently involved in .
<#> of the main arguments has been that our children should not go over there to die in this war .
where were all these folks when we sent troops over to <UNK> ?
"well , the difference was who was in office ."
"see , if our kids go over to die for a fellow <UNK> it is okay ."
"see , the current problems we are having with the anti - war movement is not necessarily the policy , but who is making the policy ."
lip service to other species <#> thing that has always amazed me about all the species of liberal is their ability to circle the <UNK> when times get tough .
see for them it is far worse for the right to have any little victory v. giving up on their specific agenda .
"for example : if nixon was a democrat , the party line would have been , “"
"look , hotel rooms get broken into all the time ."
“ dirty tricks have been a part of politics from the adams and jefferson <UNK> .
"so they took some papers , it didn’t help the campaign ."
"” see , it isn’t all about sex ."
clinton would have had to walk up to a member of the press corps . and kicked him in the nuts for them to say it was wrong .
it all ties back to the basic premise that they hate the right .
it doesn’t matter if you have to make a deal with the devil .
take a look at the democratic party and their <UNK> ( what we call species here ) .
do you really think that the labor unions give a flip about whether the yellow <UNK> swallow gets to live in its natural <UNK> ?
do you really think that the gay / lesbian crowd really cares that <UNK> in local <#> gets his $ <#> raise to cover the cost of cigarettes .
listening to the various groups and how they would react in other liberal circles .
"so , you right <UNK> , you should feel proud ."
"if it wasn’t for us , the political landscape of america would be like <UNK> with hundreds of little parties ."
you can hear what they are trying to say under the bs .
all you have to do is open up your ears .
"there are more things that hold our buddies on the left in common , but i think this is <#> of the most <UNK> ."
the left wants to tell you what to do .
let ’s look at a couple of examples that will help make this a little clearer .
last time we checked we where adults here .
"everyone know smoking is bad , then why is it"
they are <UNK> the crap out of cigarettes to try and get you not to buy them ?
<#> reasons : <#> . they know that you won’t complain about the taxes ( classic sin tax ) and <#> .
they just passed a law here in dallas that is basically a smoking ban in all restaurants .
isn’t it the <UNK> of the store owner to <UNK> in he/she would like to allow smoking in their establishment ?
"if non - smoking facilities made more money for the owners , don’t you think everyone would be switching to non - smoking ?"
"well , since it isn’t the government is telling us what we should do ."
<#> of my favorite examples is seat <UNK> .
"i don’t dispute that , but it should be my decision if i wear it or not ."
"i’m not forced to wear a life jacket if i go out on the water , so why am i forced to wear a <UNK> ?"
because the liberals are trying to protect us from ourselves .
we are not grown up enough to decide for ourselves whether or not to wear a seat belt .
okay let ’s try and figure out the logic of that ?
"furthermore , here is a real head <UNK> ."
"most liberals support <UNK> suicide saying it is the choice of the patient , but they won’t let me smoke a cigarette and i’ve got to wear my <UNK> ?"
"well , you don’t tax money that is in the bank ."
"they already have it , so they aren’t affected ."
i could go on about taxes but here is another example of the controlling attitude .
i got such a kick out of all the gay groups that had such a cow about <UNK> .
"hate speech , bla , bla , bla ."
"see , if you say anything negative about <#> of the species groups of the left , you are evil , <UNK> , whatever ."
you never see the <UNK> when people make fun of the <UNK> .
those wacky far right <UNK> want to get rid of the <UNK> ?
look at how the religious folks on my side are portrayed ?
"they are cartoons , but if you treated an african american like that , jesse jackson would be knocking on your door with thousands of his paid <UNK> ."
"to put it in a <UNK> , they are trying to change the very way we think ."
make us think that it is better to let <#> states burn up because it is bad to cut down trees .
<UNK> us into thinking that eating meat is <UNK> .
all of this control centers around big government .
"i get <UNK> about the left trying to compare the right to the book by george <UNK> , <#> ."
"in their world , <#> is a dream ."
control of the people to make sure we are all equally miserable is the ultimate goal of the left .
"in the right v left chapter , we will discuss this further , but i think it is <UNK> to touch on this many times ."
"the left is happy with a government that is growing and slowly taking over aspects of our lives to make sure we are “ safe , etc ” ."
the right is working hard to keep with the vision of our <UNK> fathers .
limited government and to give all americans the opportunity to move up by their boot <UNK> don’t fall for it .
i hope you now have an idea who we are dealing with here .
don’t forget that these are the common <UNK> that hold the left particularly the democratic party together .
for any movement to be a movement they have to have a <UNK> .
"their particular <UNK> may <UNK> , but the base is generally the same ."
i would be amazed to see a liberal pronounce that the government should not tell us to do this that or the other .
you will never see a <UNK> <UNK> that the middle and upper class is being <UNK> with taxes .
i love hearing from like <UNK> . now that we have
"the base built , let ’s move onto the <UNK> of these species ."
we will be discussing several species on the left .
"as in this chapter , there will be some common <UNK> that pull them together , but there are some very large differences between the groups ."
don’t be fooled by the rhetoric from the left .
that is why we have so many different groups that are a part of the movement ”
they are diverse as long as you hold the common themes listed above to be gospel .
i 'm new to blogging and have started this account while killing time here at work .
"for those of you that find this before i begin to spread the good word about me , hello !"
i will post often and i hope they are n't too boring .
a few months ago i was introduced to urllink <UNK> . since then
i 've grown my network of trusted business contacts to over <#> .
"with <UNK> , you can wash your own outlook contacts with those using <UNK> ."
it works on the basis of trusted relationships or ' degrees of separation ' .
"those joining my network are able to search my contacts , and if they wish to make contact - ask permission from me and vice versa ."
create an account at <UNK> urllink then invite me to join my sending an email from my urllink contacts page .
hello please feel free to add your comments here and let us know what you think ...
"<#> by <UNK> things i thought only i can manage , people i thought i have to have to complete my life ."
i’m just waving white flag for agony in my heart .
"i will think about those i let go every second i breath , but i will think them without dark clouds in my mind ."
"a while back , i had an idea for a business for myself , and now it is finally happening ."
"a couple of years ago , i started trying my hand at video editing using many different programs ."
i used our family 's own home movies to practice .
"i learned how to physically get <UNK> footage into a pc , then edit , add music , <UNK> , and titles . and"
", i learned how to burn the footage to dvd ."
"now that i have some experience under my belt , i am beginning to do it for others ."
"i take peoples old home movies , clean them up , and transfer them to dvd ."
i believe this is a good business to get into because almost everyone has old home movies that are in need of saving .
right now i am working on a project for <#> of my cousins .
i am making her a <UNK> with music for her mother 's ( my great aunt ) birthday .
i will not do much advertising because i am already getting work by word - of - mouth .
"however , i may put up a website in the future ."
"if i do , i will post a link on my blog ."
they told me that sally had convinced them to come out and talk to the boys .
the cops also said the restaurant is closed down and there is no sign of mama <UNK> .
she declined to return to the condo with the cops .
i called the newspaper and <UNK> told me sally hadn’t called in .
my review of <UNK> appeared in today ’s paper .
they got a bad review on their <UNK> .
i appreciate everyone who stuck with me through the ordeal .
it ’s almost <#> - <#> in the morning .
"i don’t see any sign of the boys outside , and kevin is asleep ."
i figure it ’s about a <#> yards to my car – back out through the condo complex along a narrow <UNK> then into the open lot .
i’m going to carry a cup of hot coffee with me .
the boys came at us right after we signed off late yesterday .
couldn’t post anything because sally and i had to <UNK> down behind the sofa .
"i think they were drunk , or frustrated , or just really angry for some reason ."
do they think i’m onto it after reading my review from <#> months ago ?
"you would think the neighbors would call the cops , but there it is , the cops ."
this whole thing is way over our heads .
they did more than pound on the door .
they threw a rock through a side window and stuck the garden hose in and flooded the bathroom .
the local police won’t help and i don’t know why .
"before it gets dark , i’m outta here ."
i shot up with a start and quickly <UNK> my head expecting the boys to have silently broken in somehow .
sally opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling .
” she was at my side and did her own <UNK> .
“ they may be taking shifts to watch the place .
i’m going to call the police again . ”
i grabbed the phone but my stomach <UNK> .
” i gently set the phone down .
“ you have your cell phone with you ?
"“ you should always keep it with you , ”"
"“ you should always keep yours charged , ” she shot back ."
"i had no idea how long it would take to charge the little thing , but it was worth a try ."
i hit the button on the lamp and just got more darkness .
” i pulled the cord on the laptop and raised the lid . “
"“ you can’t get online without a phone line , sweetheart ."
“ this house is in a hot zone .
"well , we know we can forget the police . ”"
( the above was my last “ diary ” posting .
sally has convinced me that we need to go real - time or else nobody will take this seriously .
"if you have read this far , we will post again in a few minutes ."
“ they can’t be making a big deal out of a report that they delivered food to the park ranger .
his place is less than a <#> yards from the restaurant .
seems natural that he would order from them .
"” “ look at the <UNK> “ well , that ’s around the time the guy was found dead . ”"
“ that ’s the day they figure he was killed .
” i stood and quickly <UNK> the story .
the resident ranger <UNK> the state beach and the park <UNK> to it .
"i remember the police saying his death was suspicious , but nothing <UNK> . ”"
"well , if anyone remembers your story and <UNK> the dots , an investigation might get <UNK> and the boys would be questioned ."
maybe <UNK> got something to hide and they’re tired of your <UNK> around .
” she took a quick look through the curtain . “
” i threw the <UNK> to the floor .
“ how do you know that ’s not someone else ?
” sally gave me a look filled with <UNK> <UNK> .
"that ’s where i saw the boys park their asses this afternoon , the cigarettes have been constant and in the exact same spot . and"
those <#> <UNK> don’t have to worry about being run off by some kids . ”
she waved a hand as if she didn’t care if i told our stupid little story to the cops .
"they wouldn’t believe me anyway , not after calling them to report my <UNK> ."
” “ may sure you tell them that jay has a baseball bat .
those are illegal and it just might get the cops out here . ”
“ i need some assistance with a couple of guys hanging around my place .
“ you sound like the guy that reported the <UNK> ?
you got a <UNK> slice of pie now ?
", okay , so what ’s happening now ? ”"
"“ they’re mama <UNK> boys and they , well , <#> of them at least , <#> of them served me that <UNK> this morning ."
looked like a pretty good <UNK> to me .
we can’t arrest <UNK> ‘ cause they serve <UNK> with funny little cheese designs on them .
” now i was getting really <UNK> . “
i’ve got <#> guys that have been standing outside my front door now for over <#> hours and <#> of them has a <UNK> .
"okay , we’ll send a unit out there as soon as <#> comes available ."
"we’ve got some <UNK> college kids in town tonight , might be some time before we can make it out there . ” “"
"no , they’re not illegal and neither are small <UNK> baseball <UNK> ."
"now , we’ll get a unit out there when we can . ”"
"stunned , i couldn’t think of anything else to ask and hung up ."
“ he said <UNK> and <UNK> baseball <UNK> aren’t illegal .
we wrote up a story on some guy getting arrested for <UNK> <#> last year .
get back on our web site and pull it up .
"it was , may , no , june of last year ."
” i pulled up the article and shook my head .
“ it was a <UNK> and the guy was on <UNK> .
our next call will be to the chief and <UNK> smack those <#> lazy bastards for not knowing the law .
” i shook my head again . “
"i’m sure that was a different voice and besides , those cops never saw the boys ."
they wouldn’t know about the <UNK> baseball bat . ”
” sally turned from the <UNK> of an opening in the curtain .
<UNK> think it ’s them . ” “ for crying out loud !
"” i was frustrated , angry , and yes , scared ."
” i stood up but didn’t move .
“ i should just go out there and find out what the problem is . ” “
"well , if you’re gonna do that i suggest you wait until morning when it ’s light and there ’s other people around ."
"i think i saw jay with <#> of those little baseball <UNK> , you know , like the ones they hand out at baseball games ."
"” i gave her a <UNK> look , then <UNK> back down in front of my laptop ."
do you have any idea what this could be about ? ”
“ tell me exactly what you did yesterday morning . ”
“ i decided to do another review of <UNK> .
"so i went down there early in the morning with my laptop , took a table on the patio , ordered an <UNK> , and started writing the review ."
next thing i knew i was staring down at an <UNK> with this threatening message written in cheese .
"” she ran the back of her hand across her chin , then stopped in mid - stroke ."
“ go to our website and download that review .
” a moment later the <UNK> beach <UNK> appeared over a picture of a setting sun and <UNK> water .
i printed my review of <UNK> from about <#> months ago and handed it to her .
"sally <UNK> the copy then seemed to go over it , slower this time ."
"she took a pencil , <UNK> something , and handed the review back to me ."
i think you had better look at this again . ”
the knock at the door nearly <UNK> me to the ceiling .
i had always thought that <UNK> through the <UNK> in the door was senseless .
the idea was to see who was there and be able to ignore them without them knowing you were really there .
then i was told by an expert that <UNK> would sometimes knock and then . . .
"not important , i told myself . “ it ’s sally ."
""" i know i told you to ignore anybody at the door , but here i am . """
” sally seemed to be trying to catch her breath .
“ the boys are gone and the restaurant is shut down .
"they came to the office asking where you were , where you lived ."
“ why in the hell are they after me ?
” the <#> of us froze at the knocking .
"sally , more brave than i , walked in a <UNK> fashion to the door ."
i thought her peer through the <UNK> was <UNK> .
"she <UNK> away from the door and slid to the floor , her back to the wall ."
her eyes told me her thoughts were <UNK> .
her face <UNK> into a mass of <UNK> lines .
i easily recognized the words she silently <UNK> .
it was sally at the door with <#> big cups of coffee .
"she asked me where the <UNK> was , i told her i tossed it , but that i had taken pictures of it ."
"maybe that ’s why i was the only <#> who could read the cheese , i told her ."
then she blew me away with an admission .
"she could read it too , but didn’t want to say anything in front of the cops ."
” sally took a long sip of her coffee .
"“ you make a police report , the police pay a visit to the boys ."
"they may be football players but they are not too small to play stupid <UNK> , even on customers ."
"if mama <UNK> found out <UNK> kill them , then they would come looking for you . ”"
you mean <#> or both of them took the time to arrange cheese on a customer ’s <UNK> just as a prank ?
” sally let herself out and i got busy on my laptop .
it is unfortunate when a trusted old - time business in this small beach town suddenly turns into . .
i finished the review and <UNK> it off .
<#> minutes later i heard sally ’s voice on the other end of the line .
” “ <UNK> have us in court for the rest of our natural lives .
"but more important than that , i’ve heard that the boys are looking for you right now ."
"i can’t talk now , i’ll have to call you back ."
i’m going to write a review of the restaurant and blast them .
“ you called us over here because of this <UNK> ?
at that moment sally appeared in the open doorway .
she kept <UNK> back and forth between the police officers and me .
she swept her long black hair to <#> side and twisted it over her shoulder as she leaned down to examine my <UNK> breakfast .
"“ okay , ” she said , <UNK> ."
"you can go ahead and give us a clue , ” <#> of the officers said ."
"i said , getting a bit irritated with all <#> of them . “ can’t"
” all <#> leaned forward over the <UNK> .
after a moment <#> officer slowly shook his head and stepped back .
"i said pointing , my finger an inch above the food . “ the cheese ."
they used some kind of yellow <UNK> cheese it looks like .
"” that is <#> of my problems , relating useless information ."
sally kicks me for it all the time .
” the second officer now started shaking his head .
"i’m afraid i just don’t see it , do you see anything like that , bob ? ”"
the other officer had never stopped shaking his head .
"the ‘ <UNK> is a bit <UNK> , and the ‘ <UNK> is kind of tough to make out , but you can see it , can’t you ? ”"
with my battery <UNK> i was eager to record my last few minutes at the restaurant .
"after <UNK> the <UNK> , i asked for a container to put it in and take it home ."
what they had served me had to be further <UNK> and <UNK> .
"mama <UNK> son , richard , gave me a <UNK> smile when he saw i hadn’t taken a bite of the <UNK> ."
“ we <UNK> wrapped it for you in the kitchen if all you wanted was a <UNK> .
i didn’t have my cell phone with me and there was no ‘
"minor <UNK> richard reached for my plate , i held up my hand ."
"“ i’ll just do it myself , if you would just get me the container ."
” i didn’t want him alone with my <UNK> .
i opened the <UNK> container and there it lay .
on a television commercial this would all look delicious .
i suppose the cold coffee put my senses on alert .
"something , my <UNK> told me to be aware , on the <UNK> ."
"i grabbed a fork from a kitchen drawer , for inspection , not eating ."
now i knew i was right to be <UNK> .
"as i lifted the edge of the supposed <UNK> , it came up hard , <UNK> ."
"the rest of the ingredients seemed real , though i had no intention of setting them on my tongue ."
"i had no idea what i was dealing with or what in the hell richard , mama <UNK> , had intended ."
it is saturday morning and with my laptop in hand i head down to the beach for breakfast ( and to secretly review ) <UNK> .
this small restaurant sits on the sand and offers a variety of food from pancakes to pizza .
"her husband disappeared about <#> years ago , <UNK> to dig for gold in brazil ."
i take a seat on the patio and scan the fog <UNK> ocean .
i seem to be the only <UNK> here .
"a menu arrives , but i hand it back and order the denver <UNK> and coffee ."
"mama <UNK> son , the older <#> , a bench - sitting guard on the team , <UNK> and leaves ."
the low battery light on my laptop begins to glow and my food arrives .
"i don’t mean just not hot , it is absolutely cold ."
but i can’t take my eyes off the <UNK> in front of me .
<#> . the first rule is to question everything that the president does <UNK> in a time or war .
it is our duty in a democracy and it is <UNK> not to do so <UNK> in a time of war .
the second rule is always <UNK> the motives of the president <UNK> ’s a personal check and balance that keeps us safer .
<#> . we must always criticize the economy <UNK> of what the numbers show .
can’t be <UNK> it would <UNK> those killed on <#> not to expect more of our leaders .
"<#> . you can cover all political bases by voting for a war , but then <UNK> it later ."
this is an important rule as you will always have <#> sides to stand on regardless of the crowd that you are addressing .
"the <UNK> will respect you for voting for it , and the <UNK> will love you for <UNK> against it ."
if your <UNK> are mad that you voted for the war just vote against the funding of the war .
<#> . attempt to <UNK> everyone in the current administration even if some were appointed by your political allies .
if they mess up <UNK> them and run and blame the administration for keeping him too long .
use any minor <UNK> to <UNK> the opposition .
"try not to <UNK> the soldiers , because the american people won’t like that but the administration is fair game ."
while you are at it <UNK> <UNK> charges against the president just incase he wins a second term - start <UNK> immediately .
<UNK> any horror committed by the opposition as <UNK> for the war in general .
<#> . constantly remind your <UNK> of all the awful things that america has done <UNK> let them de - <UNK> the enemy or label them as ‘
<UNK> because they will relate it to <#> and may rally behind this corrupt administration .
this is what i have learned in the past <#> weeks in my conversations with liberals on these blogs .
"the other side can <UNK> the president of every <UNK> known to man , but i can question nothing about john kerry because he served in vietnam …"
does everyone know <UNK> kerry was on a swift boat in vietnam ?
why was everyone at the convention so very <UNK> ?
will the gop convention be as ugly ?
why did they mention that j. kerry was <UNK> ” <#> times ?
why does <UNK> kerry have so many teeth ?
why did the “ john kerry movie ” <UNK> go - <UNK> <UNK> he a senator for <#> years ?
were the <UNK> on the stage real or actors ?
why doesn’t max <UNK> wear any <UNK> ?
if <#> % of the <UNK> there were anti - war <UNK> all the <UNK> of war ?
"if he has <#> <#> dollars , why hasn’t john edwards had that <UNK> removed ?"
"if they don’t want to “ limit educational opportunities ” , why vote against the school <UNK> program ?"
do you get to pick your own secret service guys ?
why does john kerry always wear the same tie ?
why hasn’t john kerry been back for his follow - up <UNK> <UNK> ?
why is gary heart so damn grumpy ?
why is the <UNK> suddenly claiming the gop values of “
why does john edwards keep having his little kids up so late ?
( this is <UNK> - speak for playing class warfare and the race card ) .
* * * my husband has to have <#> knee <UNK> and i am a stay - at - home <UNK> .
"was the guy asleep , on drugs , over - worked by his <UNK> knows and quite frankly i don’t really care ."
his <UNK> has the potential to ruin everything we have worked so hard <UNK> * * *
i want to see kerry ’s divorce records .
i want to see actions <UNK> <UNK> democrats had jack ryan ’s sealed records opened on a hunting <UNK> - i want an eye for an eye .
i want to know if that is true !
the fact that he wife was suicidal because of their marriage seems bad
<UNK> and that wasn’t <UNK> is he hiding ?
the folks have the right to know <UNK> <UNK> !
* * * we are supposed to be leaving for the beautiful outer banks of north carolina on the <#> th <UNK> have so much to do before <UNK>
* * * i saw a great bumper sticker the other day : “
"if <UNK> doesn’t trust john kerry with her money , why should america trust him with ours ” ."
"do you see what i mean about how people answer the poll question """
"is the country going in the right direction ? """
"uh , <UNK> say it 's going in the left direction ..."
"oh god , i almost forgot ... when <UNK> <UNK> was on sean <UNK> today , she <UNK> these <UNK> of wisdom on the listening audience ..."
"i know it 's kind of long , but worth the read !"
the good : anne <UNK> was <UNK> from her job of covering the “ democratic re - invention convention ” by usa today <UNK> anne <UNK> .
i wanted to post a paragraph from the article that got the papers panties in a twist –
<UNK> <UNK> ( urllink <UNK> ) written by me <UNK> :
mention <UNK> the constitution ( to <UNK> that marriage is between a man and a woman ) and you will hear a collective gasp from the left .
those evil republicans do not respect this sacred piece of paper .
; we have to force these people to be <UNK> honest .
the purpose of a representative democracy is to protect smaller states and keep them politically <UNK> .
a candidate needs <#> electoral votes to win the presidency .
in <#> bush got <#> votes and gore <#> .
the only voters that were proven to be <UNK> were the <#> <UNK> whose <UNK> <UNK> gore attempted to block ( what a patriot ) .
never before in the history of presidential politics has a candidate <UNK> over the outcome of an election . in <#>
when nixon ran against <UNK> there was overwhelming evidence that election fraud had taken place ( especially in southern texas and chicago ) .
"nixon was <UNK> to contest the election ( even by <UNK> ) , but declined ."
"he said , “ a challenge would cause a constitutional crisis , hurt america in the eyes of the world and tear the country <UNK> began the nixon <UNK> ."
in <#> all of nixon ’s <UNK> came to <UNK> .
the country was <UNK> still <UNK> torn apart .
"bush is blamed for this , but it should be gore ."
he didn’t receive enough votes to be president .
if gore would have followed nixon ’s lead our country would not be as <UNK> divided as it is during a time that it is <UNK> we be united .
i am bringing this up to show the <UNK> of the left .
almost <#> years later i still hear some <UNK> the ‘ <UNK> election .
” i hear <UNK> and <UNK> talking heads on the news <UNK> the “ wrong direction ” poll results .
what the question doesn’t ask is “ why ? ”
"get too excited when you read these polls , because i am sure that i am not the only <#> in the country that feels the ‘"
wrong <UNK> has nothing to do with george w. bush .
"<UNK> , which is the nickname for jesus which is pronounced hay <UNK> is <#> of my students ."
he wants a cigarette for an interview on my blog space .
so if the questions are answered well then maybe i 'll give him <#> .
"here goes : question <#> : what is the meaning of life , <UNK> !"
question <#> : if the sun and moon fuck are all fish cows ?
question <#> : what is a movie without popcorn like ?
"okay , now some more personal questions : question <#> : who 's the best teacher at school ?"
answer : <UNK> ! ! ! ! ! !
"excellent answers <UNK> , here is your cigarette ."
he wants me to type really fast now and i 'm blowing his mind .
"so at the year - round alternative high school where i work they 've taken the liberty of accepting a few "" students "" with severe <UNK> ."
and of course i 've been assigned to watch over the young man .
he is less a student than he is a <UNK> .
"he 's about <#> feet tall , sort of <UNK> looking , with those weird crystal blue <UNK> - dog eyes ."
"anyway , he <UNK> into the building in the morning when he is dropped off , literally throwing himself into the walls ."
he does this out of the need to repeat certain activities which make him feel comfortable .
"then he says things like "" christmas is coming -- you 're getting presents ! ! ! ! """
""" it 's like a movie without popcorn ! """
and that 's my job for the day .
"all the other kids are back now , so i must go ."
"basically , this allows you to create virtual machines having virtual hard - drives that can host ' guest ' operating systems ."
"and here 's why : more often than not , a cd is cheaper or at most only £ <#> more expensive ."
"why are on - line <UNK> so expensive , material costs are virtually <#> ?"
"as an example , thin <UNK> - live & dangerous - £ <#> on <UNK> , £ <#> for the cd at <UNK> ."
"you can pretty much play a cd on any damn cd player you choose , you ca n't do the same for your <UNK> protected download ."
the quality of music from a cd is better because the downloaded music is <UNK> using a <UNK> <UNK> .
"you can - usually - rip your cd to mp3 , <UNK> , <UNK> or whatever you fancy and again play the non - <UNK> rip wherever you please ."
"after my experience with <UNK> , ( i was unable to restore music i had purchased because it was no longer available on their <UNK> )"
"i shall never ever again purchase <UNK> music , instead i shall always buy the cd at least for as long as they continue making them ."
right now i am listening to the police ( greatest hits ) and being dragged back to my youth
i read that a year ago was the big <UNK> of <#> .
i 'm in <#> of the areas that was dark ... exactly <#> miles down the road was the <UNK> .
"while people <#> miles from me could not turn on lights , i was sitting in air conditioning watching movies and eating microwave popcorn ."
"and i know i should have felt bad , but i did n't ."
i turned that ac to high and sat back and relaxed .
what would i have done if we lost our power for that long ?
i would have lost a freezer full of food ... deep freezer as well as the <#> in the fridge .
i would have gone kind of nuts not being able to shower .
"as long as i could flush the toilet and wash i 'd be ok , but having no hot water would suck ."
"we are so dependent of electricity , right now i have on fans , television , the fridge and freezer of course , the computer , lights ..."
i know that i am a huge energy <UNK> .
"but what should i do , turn off <#> <#> <UNK> lamp or <UNK> the stereo ... would that help ?"
i like candles for their smell ... not as a light source .
i found something wonderful at the grocery store the other night ....
"i had seen the hot dogs , but not the <UNK> ."
i asked at the store about the <UNK> and they said the did n't have them .
"i said , "" but you carry the foot long hot dogs ! """
then last week they had several packages of <UNK> <UNK> hanging by the hot dog case .... but no foot long hot dogs in sight .
"it makes you wonder , does n't it ?"
who the hell is the einstein ordering this stuff ?
"all you need is a <UNK> of ketchup ( you may need mustard , however , i do not ) and you have a whole meal ."
"if you have some potato chips , it 's a bonus day !"
foot long hot dogs were a favorite of my kids .
"we would always get them when we went camping , cooking them on a little grill over the fire ."
"they fall off sticks too easily , but on a grill right over the fire they have that same taste ."
"so , today i shall have my foot long hot dog ."
( too small ) you can almost fall asleep walking around and you do n't care ....
lately most of my online friends have abandoned the regular aol <UNK> for private <UNK> .
"got to keep the <UNK> <UNK> out , you know ."
"if i wanted to talk to these <UNK> , i 'd stay in the regular aol <UNK> ."
now they know the link and we can never use that room for privacy again .
"i do n't hang around with people like that offline , why should i be <UNK> to their <UNK> rants online ?"
i got an aol account to surf the web and chat with like minded folks .... not special <UNK> .
and i am not <UNK> people with real mental <UNK> .
"i have a few online friends who are "" slow "" or even <UNK> mentally <UNK> , but they do n't annoy me ."
"the ones that annoy me are the "" hey <UNK> ?"
""" "" any fine <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> ? "" "" what size bra do you wear ? "" morons ."
i am also so sick of the teenagers who think aol is their domain .
"sorry , it 's actually an adult forum ."
"i get so pissed when some <#> year old types , "" you are too old to be in here . """
you have your own credit card to pay your own aol ?
soon we 'll all be knee deep in drool .
anyone who has had to share a computer with someone can share my frustrations .
"i love my boyfriend , but sharing a computer with someone , even someone that you love , is definitely an exercise in ...."
"oh , let 's say an exercise in not <UNK> someone to death in their sleep with a pillow ."
"instead he will spend most of his online time downloading something ... music , a game , whatever ."
then we will be infected with <#> dozen different viruses and he 'll deny downloading anything that might have caused it .
"he did this last night , so i finally just signed off and let him on ."
"i do n't know if he went back to that <UNK> , i just covered up on the couch and went to sleep ."
"he is n't trying to get my attention away from the screen when he pulls on my clothes , <UNK> me , or tries to pull my pants down ."

last <UNK> i had <#> kids in my daycare home .
"their ages were <#> <#> , <#> , and <#> <#> year olds ."
"at first i was really excited , i <UNK> <UNK> games of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , reading , etc ."
boy was i in for a reality check .
none of them knew how to play <#> game .
"they did n't even grasp the game "" concentration . """
"you know , where you put cards face down , pick <#> randomly , and try to <UNK> them ."
"i even had <UNK> memory , same thing with <UNK> characters on cards , and not even the <#> year old could "" get it . """
""" i guess i got spoiled because my own <#> children , now grown , were actually able to "" get "" games ."
"by the time they were <#> , they were playing skip bo and <UNK> and <UNK> . and"
"my mom taught them cards , and she was not a <UNK> teacher ."
"you either learned it right or did n't play , period ."
"they begged me to play mouse trap , remember that game ?"
you set up this elaborate mouse trap and try to catch you opponent 's mice under the big net at the end ?
i told them i was n't going to sit there and do it all for them .
they all <UNK> me that they had played mouse trap on many occasions and knew how to do it .
all the board games eventually went up on a really high shelf and i brought out the video games .
"they really did n't "" get "" a lot of them either , but at least the bright lights and sounds shut them up for a while ."
i have posted and deleted at least half a dozen entries so far in this blog .
"this <#> is staying , i guess , no matter how lame or whiny or self - <UNK> that seems ."
is n't a blog sort of self - <UNK> anyway ?
why would i think anything in my life could possibly be of any interest to any other person in the entire world ?
my goal at that time was to get the hell out of that place .
i just wrote down that i wanted to be debt free .
"i did n't want a <UNK> . just roll over , take it up the <UNK> shoot without <UNK> , and smile ."
"seems the more i do that stuff , the more <UNK> i need ."
i just want someone to be kind to me .
"to talk kindly , to put me first , to care what i think or feel or want ."
most of the time i feel like the only thing that matters about me to anyone is what i can do for them .
""" loan "" them money i know i 'll never see again ."
"i 'd like a <UNK> of my own , someone to really share things ."
"someone to share the bad stuff , not just the good ."
someone who <UNK> the joy and <UNK> the sorrow ... gag
"you know , what you want and what you get are n't the same thing most of the time ."
"i guess , all in all , i just want to matter ."
there was a man here in town that most everyone in town knew of .
"i 've had a couple of these dreams in the last few years , i 'm not sure what they mean yet ."
last night i dreamt that i was working in the california department of <UNK> again .
"i worked at the <UNK> station , but this <#> was not the <UNK> station ."
"<#> of my <UNK> was there , miller was his name ."
he seems to be the <UNK> <UNK> from my <UNK> past in my dreams .
the station was also suffering from my <UNK> laws of dream - physics .
everything was <UNK> and outdoors at the same time .
so there were huge <UNK> that were also support columns for a room that had a roof but did n't .
so the dream consisted mostly of <UNK> around the station this time .
there were <UNK> that were just sitting around while we had some serious work cut out for us .
i grabbed a <UNK> and suggested that everyone start cleaning up before the <UNK> walked in on us .
she was a high achieving grad student at <UNK> .
"<UNK> agreed with me and grabbed a <UNK> , then walked to another part of the station to clean ."
there were a couple of the <UNK> that were under my <UNK> .
i ordered them to help me clean the <UNK> bay and then went to the dining area to get more cleaning supplies .
"i was a little irritated and surprised , but i respected her so i did n't say anything ."
among them a woman that i had worked for ; an engineer .
her name <UNK> me but i know she 's a <UNK> chief now .
"she did n't have very high ethical standards back then , was the ' <UNK> - your - way to the top ' kind of person ."
she walked over to me and grabbed my <UNK> .
then she handed me another <#> and told me to get to work .
as i went back to the <UNK> bay i saw that everyone was just sitting around chatting with the <UNK> ( <#> <UNK> and <#> engineer ) .
i started to try to sweep a thick layer of <UNK> off the floor and my <UNK> fell apart .
"the handle consisted of half of a <UNK> ripped down the center , and the <UNK> head looked like an abused <UNK> ."
what little <UNK> were left were <UNK> and pushed out flat .
i kept working but <UNK> the fact that nobody was helping .

"unfortunately , i had to change my blog address , and re - do the entire thing ."
"the stupid , immature , stalking people at <UNK> have decided that it was n't enough to insult and <UNK> me on their own site ."
"they had to do it on my <UNK> message board , and then start up all over again about my blog ."
"evidently , i am a "" dick sucking whore "" ."
they hope i do break a leg or die .
"is n't that sweet , grown up , human ?"
"so , i did the best i could in moving the other posts over here ... see below ."
"hopefully , i can just get those morons out of my life ."
"i mean , who sits around all day on the pc and actually searches for signs on me on the web ."
"q : between work and family parties , i always wind up with <UNK> ."
is there a <UNK> <UNK> for recovering from drinking too much alcohol ?
", associate director of the brown university center for alcohol and addiction studies ."
"below , we 've <UNK> a list of <UNK> tips to help ease you through that painful morning after : drink lots of water ."
"alcohol is a <UNK> ; it <UNK> our cells , causing us to feel tired , <UNK> and generally out of sorts ."
"the sooner you can start <UNK> your supply of <UNK> , the faster you 'll start to feel healthy again . get plenty of salt and <UNK> ."
"heavy drinking <UNK> the body of these <#> important <UNK> , which together help transport and <UNK> <UNK> and water throughout your body ."
"fruit sugar ( <UNK> ) is quickly absorbed into the <UNK> , so any kind of juice will give your energy level a big boost -- fast ."
"in addition , some studies have shown <UNK> to play a part in speeding up the rate at which the body <UNK> <UNK> -- including those from alcohol ."
"orange and tomato <UNK> are good <UNK> , since both are also rich in <UNK> such as <UNK> c. do n't forget your b and c <UNK> ."
there 's no time like the morning after a big night out to load up on <UNK> .
"better yet , get your dose naturally in a glass of fresh - squeezed fruit juice ."
"alcohol causes blood <UNK> to swell , which can also lead to serious head <UNK> ."
"caffeine <UNK> that , but since it 's also a <UNK> , limit yourself to just <#> cup of coffee ."
"because alcohol can upset your <UNK> system , it 's important to line your stomach with food while you 're drinking and the day after , too ."
"plus , a balanced meal will help restore your <UNK> supply ."
"posted by <UNK> @ <UNK> am <#> comments wednesday , july <#> , <#> <UNK> day !"
if only i had the time or energy to get <UNK> !
the attitude of some people around work here is disgusting .
"there is a particular person who just refuses to do her job , and acts <UNK> than thou all day in the meantime ."
goin ' out with my fellow <UNK> <UNK> friends tonite .
"violent t - storm watch today ... but so far , no storms !"
"it 's hot as hell ... over <#> degrees , and humid too !"
"girls lie too <UNK> clark so she can’t go out tonight again her sister ’s sick , she ’s gotta baby - sit"
we don’t wonder what it might be like how could it be any better than it is with you ( repeat chorus )
that looks good <UNK> it over like that .
"posted by <UNK> @ <UNK> pm <#> comments tuesday , july <#> , <#> fed to the <UNK> ...."
why is it that some people truly enjoy hurting others ?
"why do some people like to insult , <UNK> , and otherwise <UNK> other people ?"
does making someone cry earn you some sort of stripes or something ?
"and if you do n't know when to quit , and keep going and going and going with it ..... do you get extra - credit ?"
when are you the top bully ... cooler and <UNK> than all ?
when someone gets hurt so badly that they do something drastic ?
"real fun games people play with others emotions , right ?"
just wondering what these fools might do if their constant and <UNK> insults caused someone to kill themselves .
would it feel good to have that on your head for the rest of your <UNK> life ?
i guess we never do ... from childhood on to <UNK> .... a bully never grows up .
posted by <UNK> @ <UNK> pm <#> comments i do n't want to work !

"i am glad i am not a fish , but sorry i am not a cat ."
"<UNK> have the life - sleep , eat , shit ."
"shit , eat , sleep . sleep ."
"even though i have a <UNK> , <UNK> , i have a pseudo - pet in georgia ."

"<#> weeks of <#> day weeks ( actually a couple of <#> day weeks thanks to the <UNK> holidays ) , what could be better ?"
"well ok , permanent <#> day weeks would be better"
but hey i 'm happy with what i 'm given .
"i was walking to the train station from work today , <UNK> down <UNK> stanley , when an old homeless looking man started crossing the street ."
"he got to the middle , bent over , and stood up again with a large potato in his hand ."
"he looked at me and said "" look , a beautiful potato in the middle of the street just for me ! "" ."
"then he raised his prize <UNK> and proclaimed "" this is the best potato i 've ever owned ! "" and wandered off down an alley ."
"well on a work day it goes something like this : at <UNK> the alarm goes off ( urllink <UNK> , yes i 'm getting old ) ."
"i 'll throw together a sandwich for my lunch , with some fruit and whatever other <UNK> stuff we have ."
"at about <UNK> i leave the house , walking to the end of the street where the train station is , to jump on the <UNK> train to montreal ."
i have the laptop on the train so i either watch a movie ( urllink <UNK>
now <UNK> this morning ) or work on some web stuff .
that keeps me occupied until the train arrives in montreal .
from there its a <#> minute walk to the office .
"the rest of the day is spent working on the university financial systems , until around <#> when i leave for the train journey home ."
"i get home at about <UNK> , greeted by jen , relax for a bit , wander around our lovely garden , hang out on the deck ."
"at some point we have dinner before <UNK> out in front of the tv , or finding something more exciting to do ."
"a couple of chapters of a book in bed , then its time for sleep ."
"weekends are different of course , but they 're too random to give you an average description ."
i 'll just keep you informed when we do something fun .
usually there is a man on the train in the morning who <UNK> <UNK> the next station .
"today the man was incredibly happy , <UNK> stations with obvious <UNK> , and <UNK> the final station with almost a cheer ."
"whatever happy pills he had been taken , it affected many of the passengers too , who were leaving the train with smiles on their faces ."
"anyway , my brother is here from england , i picked him up from the bus station last night and bought him home for pizza and beer ."
today he set out to explore montreal and ended up spending most of the afternoon in an english pub .
"i was completely <UNK> at the whole thing , as is usually the case with any kind of sporting activity , but i still had a good time ."
after exhausting ourselves on the volleyball court ( pitch ?
we headed back to their place for <UNK> burgers and dogs and some much needed liquid <UNK> .
"tyler wanted to teach me magic , but <UNK> was n't having that on her birthday ."
i spend all my waking moments <UNK> our vegetable patch .
"it does n't help that our ' patch ' is the size of a small sports field , i think we 'll cut it in half next year ."
"jen <UNK> the lawn while i watched and drank beer , that was the fun part of the day ."
so what do i have to show for our day in the garden ?
"well , a <UNK> upper back , an <UNK> lower back , about <#> <UNK> bites , dirt under all my <UNK> ."
i finally got around to <UNK> with the computer <UNK> gave me .
"i got everything laid out on a table in the basement , then suddenly realised ."
i also did a bunch of <UNK> and leaf <UNK> today
", i could get used to this <UNK> thing ."
we got there late so got the crappy seats right at the front .
"it 's a good movie , but not great ."
"if you like car <UNK> and spy stuff , go see it ."
"i love summer fridays , there is something so incredibly <UNK> about a <#> day work week ."
i learned about fine grain access control and policy functions today .
"sometimes it feels like i 'm slipping backwards in the race to stay on the cutting edge of technologies , then something happens at the university that makes me realise"
"we 're still racing , even if we 're not quite up at the front ."
right now i 'd say urllink <UNK> is the <UNK> team in the keeping - up - with - technology grand <UNK> .
"talking of grand <UNK> , it 's a race weekend , the urllink german race ."
"probably another home win for michael , but here 's hoping for an interesting race ."
a big yellow tent appeared by peel on <UNK> <UNK> today which turned out to be filled with urllink <UNK> .
"well when i say filled , there were about <#> of them , which is quite a lot for such a pathetic little cult ."
the slogan on the tent was something like ' something can be done about it ' .
"stay away from the big yellow tent folks , the urllink killer cult just wants your money !"
"<UNK> all - stars was amazingly hilarious , i was having trouble breathing at <#> point ."
everything from mad scientists growing giant nipples to a cooking show with roast puppy and pussy <UNK> .
urllink colin <UNK> was excellent as always .
urllink greg <UNK> came out with some great <UNK> <UNK> .
"urllink brad <UNK> , urllink sean <UNK> and jeff davis were all very very good too ( and jen thought jeff was ' incredibly hot ' ) ."
"urllink drew <UNK> tried hard , but he does n't do <UNK> as well as the others ."
"today i made a major leap forward on my current work project , which made me <UNK> content ."
"i also spent some time on the urllink mud , but got annoyed with the whiny players so i might take a few days off from it ."
i 'm watching urllink the <UNK> on the train to work .
"it 's good , but i 'm not sure why it 's # <#> on urllink <UNK> ."

tonight we 're going to see the <UNK> all - stars at urllink <UNK> .
"alex is almost here . like a good host i 've <UNK> the house , prepared tomato salad , potato salad , <UNK> and fruit salad ."
there 's beer in the fridge and gas in the bbq ( i hope ) .
"i 'm listening to the urllink <UNK> home companion on urllink <UNK> , does this make me officially old ?"
"but i do have urllink billy talent in my itunes , maybe that <UNK> things out ."
well i had to jump on the blog bandwagon eventually did n't i ?
our house is in the middle of our street .
"sorry , <UNK> urllink <UNK> there for a second ."
"we bought our house just over a year ago , a <#> bedroom cottage on half an <UNK> of land in the heart of <UNK> ."
out back is a big deck looking out over our country - like garden .
"we both love living here , but <UNK> a house is a lot of work !"
"<UNK> , cleaning , <UNK> , maintaining , it all takes a lot of effort , money and time ."
it also does n't help that we 're incredibly lazy a lot of the time .
it 's all worth it though when we come back from a couple of days away somewhere and see what a great house we 're coming home to .
"so dan and susan 's <UNK> has been officially named , i lost the bet , his name is simon oliver ."
"that also means his <UNK> are son , and as dan 's <UNK> are dan they are dan and son ."
yesterday <UNK> and richard came to visit and i used them as <UNK> pigs for my bbq skills .
"i cooked beer <UNK> pork ribs , baked onions with <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> garlic , baked potatoes and corn on the <UNK> ."
"all done in the bbq , and all delicious , although the potato <UNK> did n't go <UNK> ."
we finished the evening off by watching urllink fight club .
i do n't think i 'll ever tire of that movie .
jen 's brother dan and his wife susan are the proud parents of a new baby boy .
"he <UNK> in at <#> pounds <#> <UNK> and was born august 12th at around <#> pm , after <#> days of labour ( ouch ! ) ."
"no name or pictures yet , my money is on <UNK> or oscar ."
"after a week on my own , jen came home from toronto today ."
"we celebrated her homecoming with a sushi dinner then watched the canadian idol results show ( yes jen got me hooked , it 's all her fault ) ."
last night i ordered a chinese food delivery from restaurant la <UNK> in <UNK> claire .
"it was a little late arriving , so by the time the nice man arrived"
i was standing at the front door with my nose pressed to the glass and my stomach <UNK> loudly .
"the food was excellent though , probably the best chinese delivery i 've had in this country ."
"i just have <#> <UNK> why ca n't chinese restaurants , or any restaurants for that matter , offer urllink single serving <UNK> ?"
i got a bucket of fried rice and a large <UNK> thingy filled with general tao chicken .
"part of jen 's job involves going to trade shows , and august is the time for the toronto gift show ."
she left on friday morning and wo n't be back until thursday .
"i also attempted to <UNK> jen 's office , but that 's a <UNK> task and"
the other thing i 've been trying to do is <UNK> the bath as we seem to have had some <UNK> recently .
what a pain in the ass that is ! the strip stuff that s on there is nasty and sticky and refuses to come off <UNK> .
i may have to find a <UNK> of <UNK> acid to help me out .
"i finally managed to get <#> small area clean , and attempted to <UNK> it with the ' easy to use ' <UNK> we bought ."
"easy to use is a relative term i guess , i 'm now giving up and <UNK> to the same strip stuff that was on there before ."
"i 've lived here with jennifer for <#> and a half years now , and i love the place ."
"montreal is a modern , <UNK> , <UNK> and safe city with a long urllink history in north american terms ."
"when i first moved here we lived downtown , which was a new experience for me , i 'd never lived in the centre of a city before ."
"i loved condo living , and i loved being so close to everything , but i guess there will always be a bit of country boy in me ."
"moving out to the ' <UNK> ' , despite my initial resistance , has been just as good as living downtown ."
"we 're not quite as close to everything , but <#> minutes is n't that long , and the other advantages far <UNK> that <UNK> ."
"we have a wonderful house on a large plot , which we probably could n't afford this close to any other large city ."
"although it is the <UNK> , it feels more like living in the country ."
"we are a short walk from <UNK> st louis , a short walk from <UNK> woods and a short drive from the urllink morgan <UNK> ."
"every day i walk to work from the train station and back again , and i love the sights and sounds of the city around me ."
in summer montreal is filled with <UNK> and a <UNK> atmosphere .
"we 've enjoyed the urllink comedy festival , the urllink fireworks festival and of course the urllink grand <UNK> ."
last night we had our monthly pub quiz at urllink <UNK> 's irish pub on <UNK> street .
a group of us gather there on the first tuesday of every month for an evening of mindless trivia .
each month a different person ( or people ) write and host the quiz .
"this month it was our turn to host , with help from kim ."
"we had <#> categories , including ' heard at the movies ' from kim , ' jennifer 's <UNK> ' from jen , and a <UNK> category from me ."
"i 'm not sure how good my <UNK> was , but everyone got most of them right"
our goal now is to break their dominant run !
for about <#> years now i 've been playing a mud online .
mud stands for multi user <UNK> or multi user domain .
it 's a text based <UNK> role playing game set in a vaguely <UNK> world .

today we drove up to the country to visit the in - laws .
we decided to try out the ferry route from hudson to <UNK> .

"as soon as we 're <UNK> , i lean my seat all the way back , to give mr ."
"sleep most of the flight , land in <UNK> late ."

"buy a few more gifts , run out of <UNK> , stop at a small guitar shop on the way back to the hotel ( buy nothing honey ) ."
"drop off stuff at the room , head out to the city mall next door to the hotel , did n't make it there last time ."

we take the bullet train to <UNK> ( about <UNK> ) .
"we 're the lucky ones , some of the crew had to take a passenger bus last night to <UNK> , time <UNK> ."
"they really should invest in some tour buses over here , and not the crappy euro ones , but a nice custom <UNK> ."
"doors are already open , load in and setup on side of the stage ."
"at least its not as hot as <UNK> , as we are <UNK> ."
"more hanging around , since we do n't go on till <#> pm ."
"he has some good ones , as he also worked for <UNK> and the stones ."
"they have trouble with the drum <UNK> , and go on <UNK> late ."
"hey , it happens at <UNK> , when you get no <UNK> ."
"brad and i watch from behind pete 's <UNK> , you can hear them great here ."
i can tell brad is really getting charged up for our show .
"i go and stand by alan , he shows me <#> of pete 's guitars that has blood all over the <UNK> ."
"we go on late , due to the who technical difficulties ."
"brad is in rare form tonight , he really got <UNK> up watching pete ."
"the band calls all kind of <UNK> , and some golden <UNK> get played that were n't on the set list ."
"load out , tonight it takes twice as long to load the truck ."
"same guys that have packed it the entire time here , ca n't get it right tonight ."
the sound truck is almost done loading by the time our guys finally figure it out .
back to the hotel for a shower and some sleep .

"sleep in to around <#> , sure is hard when the sun hit 's the windows at <#> am ."
"i 've now finished my last book , so not to much to do ."
"by <#> am i 'm bored , decide to head to the gig at noon , at least there 's food and high speed internet ."
"arrive at the gig , our crew room is packed , everybody 's online ."
"we call out a search for the <UNK> scream , someone comes up with it and soon all you can hear is the call of the mighty <UNK> ."
"go up to the stage , catch a little of michelle branch while setting up my gear , it is <UNK> inside our guitar world ."
<UNK> for a while then head inside for the air conditioning .
go out around <UNK> to get ready to see the who at <#> .
"grab a set list from my buddy alan , wow nothing but hits ."
"by <UNK> , the wings are filled with all of our band members and family ."
"the crowd loves them , hard to believe this is their first show ever in japan ."
it 'll be cool to see it again tomorrow too .
sun is setting as we go on around <UNK> .
"pete <UNK> is off - stage left as we wait for our guys , i grab a chance to have him <UNK> a guitar magazine for me ."
"our show is good , but it 's hard to follow such a <UNK> set by rock <UNK> ."
"finish up and load out , back to the hotel by <UNK> ."
"must have my bag down by <#> pm for the truck , since we are going directly to the gig tomorrow at <#> am ."
"plan on meeting some guys in the lobby at 9:30 to head into tokyo to the "" motorcycle street "" ."
"at 9:30 gather up the guys and head in , rob comes along again , as well as his wife , who flew in last night ."
"i am the tour guide , as i have the only map and seem to know the train system ."
"we <UNK> for the <UNK> , as we are in no hurry and we 'll probably take the bullet back from tokyo ."
"we have to make <#> connections , but i find an express train that should save some time ."
"train ride is not a problem , we hit tokyo station in about an hour ."
"it is huge , about like penn station in nyc , with the bullet , jr <UNK> , and jr subway all from the same station ."
we find our connection and make <UNK> in about <UNK> .
"we stop at the <UNK> store first , this is the big <#> that was closed last wednesday ."
"it is <#> floors of <UNK> , <UNK> , and shoes ."
"we hit a few of the same shops as well , since gary and jerry , who also came along , missed those on wed ."
i take a few more pictures for the die hard <UNK> boys at home ( you know who you are ) .
i even see a shop with <#> used <UNK> 's .
break down and buy some elf riding boots and a cool <UNK> riding bag and a few gifts .
"ca n't get this stuff at home , plus it was on sale ."
"gary gets his <UNK> helmet <UNK> he was looking for , and we head back to the train station bound for <UNK> or "" electric town "" ."
"i 'm there for the <UNK> market , as i 've done the big stores in the past ."
rob and ellen pass on <UNK> 's and head out on their own .
"i give them <#> of my train maps , they 'll be fine ."
"after eating we hit the <UNK> market <UNK> , which is several <UNK> about <UNK> long and maybe <UNK> wide with <UNK> on both sides ."
<UNK> does n't even begin to describe this place .
"there are all kinds of spy cameras , computer parts , tubes , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and tools here ."
"not really looking for anything specific , it 's just fun to check out ."
gary has never been and his mind is blown .
"look at a few other shops , then head for tokyo station and the bullet train to <UNK> ."
"arrive at tokyo station , but none of us can figure out which bullet train to get on for <UNK> ."
"of trying , we give up and head for the jr express we took this morning ."
find the express and within an hour we are back in <UNK> .
up to the room to rest and get out of the heat .
"at <#> pm , meet others in lobby to hit our # <#> favorite noodle shop for dinner ( this will be dinner number <#> there ) ."
"soon they will be greeting us there like norm in "" cheers "" ."
eat more great noodles and <UNK> and see a few crew members there .
head back to the hotel and visit the grocery store in the basement .
"find the prices are more than the convenience store , so we head for the <UNK> 's for <UNK> ."
back to the room for a dvd and much needed sleep .
"after staying up till <#> am last night , i get up around 8:30 this morning ."
skip <UNK> 's since i 'm still full from <UNK> last night .
will go back before we leave to get some stuff to take home .
leave the hotel at <#> pm to set - up for the gig at <UNK> international stadium .
"eat some curry chicken in <UNK> for lunch , then go load in ."
they played the world cup here a few years ago .
time to head back to the hotel and take a big group out to our favorite noodle shop .
"great guys , hope they 'll get to join us for dinner ."
"gather almost the entire <UNK> crew and a few others and head to the noodle shop , not too crowded , so no wait ."
"a few more guys pass by the window , see us and come in to join us ."
"then the who crew stops in , but have to wait for a table ."
a few others from our crew are waiting as well .
soon there wo n't be anyone in the place who 's not a crew guy .
those who had n't been before are <UNK> about it .
"we finish eating , as we 're all stuffed , decide to walk it off ."
jerry and i end up walking around with with the <UNK> from the who crew .
"these guys have <UNK> been in this business for probably <UNK> years , they 've seen it all and have great stories to tell ."
i hip <#> of them to the key lime kit - kat 's they have over here and he 's on a mission to find some .
"we hit a few convenience stores , score the kit - kat 's and head back to the hotel ."
make plans with a few guys to head into tokyo to the ' motorcycle street ' again in the morning .
that should kill a good part of our last day off in japan .
"grab breakfast at <UNK> 's , i know , i know ."
read in the paper that yesterday was an all - time high temp wise in tokyo .
"i notice another odd thing about the japanese , no <#> wears sunglasses ."
meet rob at <#> and we take the jr train to <UNK> .
we arrive and start looking around for our ' street ' .
"we walk around outside and finally spot a cycle shop , this must be the place !"
we head down the alley and it opens up to a big street lined on both sides with bike shops .
"it 's still before <#> , so not all are open ."
"we hit the open ones , these shops have more <UNK> , gloves , <UNK> , etc ."
"also , some shops are all high - performance parts of every description , but few <UNK> parts :("
"oh well , there are alot of used bikes for sale on the sidewalk of the shops too ."
just do n't think they 'll fit in my suitcase . as it turns out the biggest store is closed on <UNK> .
we walk around looking in the shops till it 's time to head back to the hotel for lobby call .
"neither of us buys anything , but we just know what we want is in those closed stores ."
may have to train it back on friday and check it out again .
"back at the hotel , we <UNK> and wait for the buses ."
i get down in time to get on the second bus .
"i sleep most of the way , being hot and tired after our morning of walking around ."
"check into the hotel in <UNK> , it is a <#> story round building ."
i 'm on the 28th floor and have a cool view of the city .
"outside my window is also the bullet train tracks , and <#> goes speeding by every few minutes ."
head out for lunch and find a <UNK> little noodle shop .
"( actually <UNK> , but that 's how it was spelled on the menu ) ."
run into the <#> - <#> for <UNK> and back to the hotel to chill .
"looks like rain anyways . after posting on this weblog , fall asleep till around <UNK> ."
<#> of the guys calls and we decide to go out to dinner .
"run into <#> of our regular sound guys , <UNK> , who happens to be japanese , and head out to find some <UNK> ."
"end up back at the same place we stopped for lunch , it is now packed and there 's a line out the door ."
"put our name on the list , and shortly we have a table ."
"order <UNK> with shrimp and chicken <UNK> , it is amazing ."
everyone agrees this is the best <UNK> so far .
turns out this is a small family owned place going back <#> generations .
skip <UNK> 's as we 're going to the gig at <#> .
"get to the gig , it 's a huge indoor baseball stadium with an ' air roof ' ."
this means the whole <UNK> is <UNK> and the roof is held up by the air pressure .
this of course means we can not hang our lights and sound off the roof .
"a series of towers are built to hold a <UNK> of <UNK> that the lights , sound , and video wall are hung off of ."
"pretty impressive , and a little scary when your standing under it all day ."
"band arrives in the afternoon , no <UNK> today ."
"all of the bands families are here now , and i do mean all ."
the dressing room hall way is like a zoo and barely <UNK> with all the kids and guests hanging out .
"mine 's a fake , but it looks real and not too many people can tell the difference ."
have pasta with chicken and grilled tuna for dinner in <UNK> .
"show is at <#> , and it flies by ."
our monitor mix sounds great and the boss is happier than usual .
load out the gear and my regular truck driver is n't around .
"in fact , there 's a completely different guy packing the truck ."
"by the time he gets to the end i 'm not sure it 's all going to fit , but he makes it happen ."
back to the room for a shower and some sleep .
get up and check email and read the japan times .
everyone keeps saying i 'm eating too much mcdonald 's .
"i agree , but i 've been just trying to go for breakfast , need fuel for these <UNK> days of walking ."
"so , i get my <UNK> this morning around <#> am , <UNK> said ."
head to the jr ( japan rail ) train station and head towards <UNK> .
arrive in <UNK> and the streets are full of people .
"first stop is <UNK> land , a <#> floor toy store , where i always buy some gifts for my <UNK> and others ."
"after <UNK> land , we walk around checking out the small shops on the back streets ."
"i try to find the paul frank store , but never see it ."
"( realize when i get back to the room and look at the map , that it is actually inside a department store ) ."
"hit my favorite <UNK> store "" chicago "" , but do n't see anything ."
get back on the jr and head back towards the hotel .
stop in <UNK> to check out the guitar stores again . not as crowded as yesterday .
"find my <UNK> , and after a little <UNK> with the guy , i buy it ."
"i end up paying half of what the new ones are going for , so i think i got a deal ."
now something will have to go on ebay when i get home .
"jerry talks himself out of the <UNK> he was going to buy , it 's a good deal , but he walks ."
"he has more <UNK> than me , i guess ."
"we check out a few more guitar stores and head back to the hotel on the jr , man this guitar is heavy ."
arrive at the station and we decide to be daring and try the ' <UNK> ' balls they sell at a stand across from the hotel .
we watched them make some last night and they looked intriguing ( kinda like fish cakes ) .
"we buy a box of <#> , medium spicy and take them back to the room ."
"bite into the first <#> , not terrible , but not fish cakes either ."
"chill in the room for a while , gonna go over to the gig later and see what 's up ."
go over to the gig to upload some pictures using the free high speed connection .
"decide to <UNK> in <UNK> ( hey , it 's free ) , fried rice and <UNK> chicken ."
"surf the internet with about half of our crew , hanging out in our <UNK> ' crew room ' ."
nice when you do n't have a bus to go to on the <UNK> .
"wow , slept till my alarm went off at <UNK> ."
i 'll beat this <UNK> just in time to leave for the states .
"up early to create this new blog , i like the layout better and it 's easier to upload pictures ."
"talk to my mom on i m for awhile , their house seems to be coming along nicely ."
"we 're of on the bullet train again , this time to tokyo ."
"arrive in tokyo , buses ca n't park at the station ."
we cross the street and wait in the hot sun for <UNK> .
"bus takes us to the tokyo <UNK> hotel ( right next to the gig ) , travel time <UNK> ."
immediately head out to go guitar shopping in <UNK> .
"first stop at <UNK> 's , must have a quick bite ."
"<#> problem , the jr map is all in japanese , usually it is in english too ."
"anyway , figure out our fare is <UNK> and get a ticket from the machine ."
at least the platform signs are in english .
"it 's a short ride to our stop and we get off and it looks like <UNK> street in nyc , nothing but music stores ."
i 'm looking to score a deal on a <UNK> ( japanese ) and i 'm disappointed in the stock in most of the stores .
we make some new friends at <#> store by handing out <UNK> picks .
<#> <UNK> even has the <UNK> logo shaved in the side of his head .
at the last shop i find a black <UNK> <UNK> for a deal .
"decide to wait till tomorrow to get it , as i might find something else in my travels ."
head up to the room to write and check emails . out to a noodle shop for dinner .
"have <UNK> with bell peppers and chicken , also <UNK> , and rice ."
baseball game is letting out as we 're walking back and we 're swimming against the tide .
make it into the hotel and there is a queue for the <UNK> .
no <UNK> 's in sight so i drink green tea and surf the ' net till lobby call at <#> am .
"have my laundry sent out , hope it 's not too expensive ."
"set up , and line check , done by <#> pm ."
"they want to shoot all <#> of my guitars , takes no time , done by <#> pm ."
doors are at <#> pm and show at <#> pm .
"show goes well , band throws a few <UNK> in for good measure ."
"oh well , shower and take my bag down to the lobby to be sent ahead ."
"i just started on my last book , think i 'll need to trade around with someone before the tour ends ."
"sleep till <#> this morning , probably due to the late night ( for me at least ) ."
"go down to the mcdonald 's in the basement , much shorter walk ."
"hang out for a bit , then back to the room to get my stuff together for the trip to <UNK> ."
"we ride the bullet train again , takes <UNK> ."
get to my room an there 's my bag .
i 'll be able to finally publish this blog today .
"head out for some lunch , and it 's after <#> pm , so everything 's closed again ."
"walk by the hard rock cafe and decide it 's hot , and probably we 'll do no better <UNK> ."
meet the other half of the <UNK> crew there .
"i have <UNK> chicken pasta , and it is amazing . or"
"probably mediocre , but after the cup o ' noodles it 's killer ."
"<UNK> too expensive , but what are you going to do ."
"i 'm now stuffed , we <UNK> a while watching the lame videos they are playing and looking at the <UNK> on the walls ."
stop by the <UNK> 's on the way back for a big bottle of water .
head up to the room to do some web surfing and blog writing .
"after <UNK> this blog , fighting to stay awake ."
"decide to go for a walk , dark now and <UNK> down to <#> ."
hit the convenience store for ice cream ( too full from lunch to eat dinner ) .
i m my lovely wife and read till i fall asleep .
"sleep in till <#> am . must go to mcdonald 's at <#> am , i think it 's the law now ."
walk the <#> blocks to the arcade and the closest <UNK> 's .
"today i discover how to <UNK> my orange juice , this is a major <UNK> ."
"after breakfast , walk around the arcade , go in a few stores that are open ( still early ) ."
head back to the hotel to get some more <UNK> .
decide to go to the peace park and the <UNK> bomb museum ( might as well get some culture ) .
arrive at the peace park a few blocks from the hotel .
"there is a building called the <UNK> <UNK> , which partially survived the nuclear bomb of <#> ."
"this is a <UNK> place , and a <UNK> tribute to the <UNK> of war ."
the nuclear bomb that ended wwii killed around <#> of <UNK> 's citizens .
we now have bombs thousands of times as deadly as that <#> .
"leave the museum a little <UNK> , but glad that i went ."
walk around some more and decide to shop for gifts and spend $ <#> easy .
"my legs are starting to hurt from all the walking , plus these bags are getting heavy ."
"quick stop at <UNK> 's for lunch , do n't feel like trying to find anything else ."
"not too hungry , but walk out the side door of the hotel and see food signs ."
there seems to be <#> floors of restaurants right next to the hotel .
"i do see that there is a <UNK> 's in the basement , right under the hotel ."
"oh well , back to the <UNK> 's for cup o ' noodle ."
take my bag down about <#> pm and before i can even get out of the elevator the <UNK> is taking my bag from me .
i ask him to put it with the other crew bags .
"i follow him and he finds another <UNK> , after many hand <UNK> , we seem to agree that my bag will go with the others ."
i pray it is at the hotel when i get there .
find it and make a mental note of the location .
at <#> am we <UNK> the hotel for <UNK> .
"today we take the bullet train , which <UNK> about <UNK> , does n't seem that fast , but it gets you there in a hurry ."
"on the way we are informed that the show in <UNK> has been cancelled , due to the singer 's fall on the previous night 's gig ."
"great , more days off , more $ $ to spend ."
"arrive in <UNK> , it is boiling hot , of course ."
head out to shopping district in search of food .
walk around for an hour shopping and still looking for food .
"it is around <#> pm , so some places are already closed for lunch ."
end up in a <UNK> belt sushi place again .
"food is n't bad , but since it 's so late , no new sushi is being added ."
we just watch the same stuff go around and around .
finally we decide to leave and my bill is under $ <#> .
"shop some more for gifts , mostly just scope out stores for tomorrow . find a cool guitar store and spend <UNK> ."
"looking at guitars , too expensive to buy anything here . back to the room and"
"fall asleep for an hour or so , it 's dark when i get up ."
"not too hungry , so head out to the <UNK> 's for another cup o ' noodle dinner ( <UNK> ) ."
"then due to my nap , i read till about <#> am before falling asleep ."
wait till <#> to venture out to <UNK> 's ( convenience store ) for <UNK> .
"they 've decided to not turn on the <UNK> till we get there , i feel like a turtle in a small <UNK> , throw in some lettuce please ."
"set up gear , eat lunch in <UNK> , surf internet , wait for band , etc ."
"head to <UNK> for dinner , they are serving tiny little baked potatoes , about the size of a red <UNK> ."
"show is at <#> pm , gets off to a good start ."
"during the last song before the <UNK> , singer falls off stage ( which has been raised to <#> - <#> feet ) ."
security guy breaks his fall and he seems ok .
most of the band did n't even see it happen .
"finish show , load out , return to hotel by <UNK> ."
shower and take my luggage downstairs ( it goes by truck to the next hotel ) .
"in the lobby are numerous japanese fans and they <UNK> on certain members of the crew looking for picks , etc ."
they do n't bother me and i head back up to the room and stay up till <#> pm .
"get a call and go to mcdonald 's around <#> am for breakfast , i decide to buck fashion and wear shorts , as it is <UNK> hot ."
order <UNK> and eat outside next to street <UNK> .
"while eating , <UNK> crew members show up with tales of falling asleep last evening and <UNK> in the middle of the night ."
"well , at least i 'm not the only <#> ."
then venture off with my usual day off partner in crime jerry .
we head for the <UNK> with electronics town ( et ) the ultimate destination .
this place is like some <UNK> out <UNK> and canal street rolled into <#> .
"shops of every description and small restaurants ( i use the term loosely , as some are just stands ) are every few feet ."
we find <#> arcade that is all restaurant supply stuff .
some cool <UNK> and places that sell the fake plastic food that you find outside the restaurants here to <UNK> what they sell .
"the plastic food places are bizarre , everything from plastic sushi to plastic beer ."
we browse and vow to return and buy gifts on the way back .
"on our way to et , we see a music store ."
"as <UNK> we go in and check out the new and used guitars , even see a few deals , but pass on buying anything ."
"hit a few <UNK> in et , see some cool digital cameras that probably wo n't hit the us for a few months ."
deals are n't any better than the states ( some worse ) .
"but , if you want the latest - greatest this is the place ."
"i want a new digital camera , but i 've been looking at them for a year now and have still not decided to pull the trigger on <#> ."
check out a cool hobby store with <#> floors of models and such .
"search for a <UNK> gp bike model , but no go ."
"they have plenty of honda ones though , even a <UNK> <#> ."
end up back at the restaurant row and buy a few gifts .
"we remember passing some good noodle houses in our travels , so we head that way ."
"now of course we ca n't find <UNK> to eat , there are mcdonald 's and wendy 's , etc ."
after walking around for an hour we finally decide on a <UNK> belt sushi place we 've passed a dozen times .
"we go in , it 's pretty busy , but we get a seat at the front ."
"these places are great , the sushi comes by on little plates with <#> or <#> pieces of sushi on them ."
you pick what you want and the plates are <UNK> when you finish .
"the guy is making sushi right in front of us , so you know it 's fresh ."
normally sushi is not that great in japan compared to the us .
"i must say this was the <UNK> sushi i have ever had , the tuna had obviously been freshly killed , and seen minimal freezing ( if any ) ."
"there were quite a few things we did n't recognize ( or eat ) , so we just let them pass by ."
"we finish and <UNK> up the plates , my total comes to <UNK> ."
"i 'm stuffed and it 's under $ <#> , who says japan is expensive ?"
"after eating , we realize we have been walking around for <UNK> hours ."
time to take the <UNK> back to the room and get a little rest .
of rest i start getting sleepy ( it 's only <#> pm ) . not good .
"i decide to venture back out , jerry passes , so i 'm on my own ."
"i want to check out the <UNK> town ( like our china towns ) , just north of the hotel ."
walk through an arcade i have never been through and buy a shirt for myself along the way .
"get to <UNK> town and it 's a lot of <UNK> with small <UNK> clothing , record and shoe stores ."
there 's a bunch of punk rock kids and a few <UNK> looking characters around .
"feel a little <UNK> , but have no problems ."
"visit a few <UNK> places , now i know why there 's no good <UNK> in the us anymore , it 's all over here ! !"
"see a few <UNK> , but most stuff is <UNK> and see nothing i ca n't live without ."
wander back to the <UNK> and decide to hit the tower records near the hotel .
score a <UNK> 's best of cd in tower and a japanese guitar mag .
by now it is <UNK> and i 've walked around for almost <UNK> . today .
"go back to the room , email , read and make it to almost <#> pm before falling asleep ."
put on the same clothes for the 4th day in a row .
"go down for <UNK> lobby call for airport , no bag ."
"talk to <UNK> , she says my bag will be at the check - in counter ."
"go to counter with <UNK> , and see my bag directly behind the girl checking us in ."
"ask if i am able to open it before the flight , she says ok and hands me bag ."
i immediately get new clothes out and put them in my backpack so i can change asap . <UNK> re - check my bag with <UNK> <UNK> .
"we are getting a group check - in , so it takes a while ."
band and their families arrive ( they are on same flight ) .
until i realize the crew is gone and i 'm now hanging with the band and <UNK> <UNK> .
"walk to the gate with boss and family , he does n't get <UNK> too much ."
"arrive at gate , where there are <#> or so japanese <UNK> in uniform , who freak when singer arrives ."
"they board us first , pretty cool , and we ( the crew ) sit in the upper deck of the <#> ."
"i have a window seat , and there is even a <UNK> under the window that my messenger bag fits in ."
plane is full and japanese crew member sits next to me ( in middle seat ) .
"i <UNK> my nose and look out the window , we are very high up , compared to the usual jet ."
"on take off , they have a camera <UNK> on the landing gear , and you can see the <UNK> flying by ."
"we do n't seem to be going very fast , but plane takes off easily ."
"uneventful flight , do see the strange man - made island airport that is built outside <#> of the cities ( forgot which <#> ) ."
i hear it <UNK> a few inches every day .
watch as regular passengers get their bags and leave .
"wait by our special belt , and get our bags slowly come out <UNK> later ."
"so glad we got the "" special "" treatment ."
"head outside , immediate climate change from <UNK> , hot and humid , did i mention humid ?"
it 's about <#> degrees and i have jeans on .
"find the truck and load in bag , then go to bus ."
hotel is above the <UNK> station in a very busy part of <UNK> .
go out with other <UNK> guys across the street to noodle shop .
"we order some , and i order <UNK> too ."
"walk around <UNK> a bit , notice that although it is incredibly hot , no <#> is wearing shorts , except for kids and old people ."
"we head back to hotel around <#> pm , promise to meet others around <#> pm for dinner ."
start reading in room and decide to take short nap around <#> pm .
i awake at <UNK> and feel like i 've been <UNK> .
"go back to sleep till <UNK> , then get up to read and check email ."
"sun is not up yet , it waits till <#> am to rise ."
"check email and read some more , <UNK> a little ."
"get invited to mcdonald 's ( the american <UNK> ) for breakfast , but i pass ."
drive to the gig ( see a pattern here ? )
"production office , dressing rooms , are at <#> end ( home plate side ) and stage at the other ( <UNK> ) , takes at least <UNK> ."
"<UNK> with the hotel about my bag around <#> am , still not there ."
set - up gear and do my gig - thing .
"band is supposed to come in at <#> pm for <UNK> , doors are at <UNK> , show at <#> pm ."
"early shows are cool , but why am i so tired ?"
"band <UNK> to <UNK> in the <UNK> room not the stage , much running back and forth ."
ask <UNK> to check with united on my bag .
"she finds out it was supposed to be on a <#> am flight , but it was cancelled due to fog over <UNK> ."
"she tells me they are sorry and want to show me "" respect "" by paying me $ $ ."
borrow a black shirt for the gig ( thanks travis ! )
"gig goes smooth , at least from my end ."
"band plays <UNK> , since there is no opening act ."
load out and back to the hotel by <UNK> .
fall into bed and pray my bag arrives tomorrow .
"sun rises at <#> am and so do i. this is not good , but after all the sleep on the plane what do i expect ."
"try to read , fall back asleep and wake up around <#> am ."
go out around <#> am with other <UNK> crew who have also been awake for hours .
"where we are staying in <UNK> is pretty suburban , we walk around for an hour before heading back to the train station we passed in the first <UNK> ."
"we find a noodle shop with some nice ladies working , who speak no english ."
"we order <UNK> and <UNK> , but they do n't have <UNK> , <UNK> ."
and we pay our <UNK> and go to the <UNK> shop next door .
the <UNK> ( $ <#> store ) has some cool stuff
"and i buy a phone cord for my <UNK> , since i left <#> of the <#> i have at home ."
"head back to the room and <UNK> a little , since it 's raining again ."
"united calls , my bag will be in tokyo today , and should arrive at the hotel in <UNK> by noon saturday ."
"end up sleeping into the evening and <UNK> my sleep pattern some more , oh well , i 'll be up at <#> am anyway ."
"we arrive in tokyo , wait in <#> - <UNK> ."
"little japanese guy comes by calling our names , takes us to the front of the line so we can make our connection ."
"get through immigration to baggage claim , i do n't see my bag anywhere , not good ."
"little guy tells me to go to united baggage claim counter , as i watch my fellow crew members claim their bags and walk through customs ."
"fill out paperwork at united counter , i 'm promised my bag will arrive tomorrow ."
another little guy runs me over to customs officer .
"they <UNK> me through and luckily i see my <UNK> on other side ( they lost someone else 's bag too , so i do n't feel so bad ."
drive to tokyo - <UNK> airport for our flight to <UNK> .
<UNK> 's crew checks us in with japan <UNK> .
everyone is very nice and they even give us <UNK>
"we board our flight for <UNK> , it 's very empty and the flight is uneventful ."
"arrive in <UNK> , it 's raining of course , get on a bus for the <UNK> ."
"get to hotel , it is now almost <#> pm ."
i will now try to read and then sleep .
"leave <UNK> for <UNK> , japan via chicago and tokyo ."
"leaving <UNK> , partly because dubya was flying in for a $ <UNK> a plate <UNK> , hope they all got food <UNK> ... arrive in chicago with <UNK> ."
"to connection , take "" secret "" bus to separate terminal for connection ."
"i say "" secret "" , because i 've never seen this bus before , and there was only <#> of us on there ."
"sorry , back to the point , get to the gate for tokyo flight , plane is out of service , they must get <#> from denver ."
"run into fellow <UNK> crew members , we 're told by united that take off will be delayed at least <UNK> ."
looks like a long day just got longer .
i get lucky on flight and sit next to an american couple on their way to singapore .
"flight , or at least it seems that way ."
"my flute is a wooden <UNK> <#> with a b - foot , an <UNK> g , and french style keys with pointed key arms ."
the flute is hand - made from <UNK> wood and the keys are made of solid silver .
it 's not so unlike the sound produced by a silver flute that it ca n't blend .
"rather , the upper register is not so bell - like ."
"it 's more "" <UNK> ... but in a good way ."
well ... that 's where the difference between my flute and a silver flute is really heard .
"and i 'm beginning to suspect that it might love me , too ."
"the more time i spend with it , the better it treats me ."
this flute is approximately <#> years old and is in excellent used condition .
the case is original and is also in excellent used condition .
"the flute has a solid silver head , body , and foot ."
the flute is open - <UNK> with french style pointed key arms .
the flute has a b - foot and an <UNK> g. this flute comes with <UNK> 's <UNK> cut <UNK> .
"this flute was cleaned , <UNK> , and adjusted in may <#> by urllink <UNK> flute service ."
this is a very fine semi - professional quality instrument with excellent <UNK> in all <UNK> .
$ <#> urllink click here for photos of the flute .
it has no <UNK> and only very minor <UNK> associated with age and use .
the case is original and is also in very good used condition .
"in july of <#> , it was complete <UNK> by <UNK> at urllink flute world ."
all new pads and <UNK> were installed and the flute was thoroughly cleaned .
<UNK> <UNK> of this <UNK> are known for being high quality step - up level instruments .
( do some research on the quality of new <UNK> <UNK> before you pass up this older flute ! ! the older models are better . )
"this flute has a solid silver head and silver - <UNK> body , foot , and keys ."
it is open - <UNK> and has a c - foot .

okie <UNK> ... so i 'm through ( for now ) with the <UNK> and i 've moved on to the <UNK> .
"i have n't listened yet , but i 'll report back when i do ."
i 'm told that <UNK> does some particularly nice <UNK> work in the <UNK> .
"i have to assume you 're interested , right ? ;-)"
"on <UNK> , i 'm working my way through the <UNK> <UNK> method ."
i 'm about <#> of the way through . once in a while
i 'll also pull out <#> of the <UNK> exercises .
i 'm making progress with the <UNK> so ... that 's <UNK> .
i 've been working through the <UNK> <#> <UNK> techniques ( <UNK> <#> ) and i 'm about <#> of the way through .
"( if you 're familiar with these <UNK> , you 'll know what a challenge that can sometimes be ! )"
this week i 'm on <UNK> number <#> ( ... number <#> ... number <#> ... number <#> ... )
"( if you 're too young to have been a beatles fan , that wo n't mean anything to you . )"
"i 'm looking forward to number <#> , though !"
how can you not get excited by a <UNK> like this : <UNK> con <UNK> la <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> :-) ...
"besides the <UNK> <UNK> , i 'm also working on the 3rd movement of the <UNK> g major <UNK> using the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"and , for <UNK> fun , i 'm working on the <#> <UNK> by roger nixon ."
i had never heard of this piece before my flute teacher <UNK> it out .
"i can almost hear all you men who are reading this page thinking , "" oh sure ... if only the average american <UNK> did look like that ! """
"well , we ca n't all be <UNK> page ."
"actually , when i <UNK> this photo off the web , i had no idea who this woman was ."
i just liked the look of her -- sort of naughty and <UNK> .
"my husband recognized her immediately , though . "" wow !"
"i have n't seen any pictures of her in years ! """
he claims a guy he knew while he was in the navy who had an entire <UNK> filled with photos of <UNK> <UNK> .
"apparently , this photo is <#> of <UNK> ones she ever did ."
she also posed for a lot of pictures wearing strange leather outfits and a ball - gag . and all this was back in the <UNK> !
"these days , being a <UNK> is a pretty rare thing ."
being a <UNK> and being healthy and educated and not having any children is almost <UNK> of .
", though , that very few people ever ask me why i wanted to quit work and stay at home ."
just about everyone i know wakes up every morning desperately wishing they could just stay home .
there 's no more arguing with the spouse over <UNK> .
i do it better than he ever could anyway .
when the spouse gets home from work we have our evenings and entire weekends free for relaxing and <UNK> around .
there are no chores waiting to be done because i 've done them all during the <UNK> .
"consequently , we both have more time to do the things we really like to do ."
"when i decided to become a <UNK> , there were certain expectations i developed for myself ."
i prepare a lunch for the spouse to take with him to work every day .
i have dinner ready when he comes home from work .
"the idea is that when the spouse comes home from work every day , he is n't expect to do anything but relax and enjoy himself ."
there 's considerably less stress for both of us .
and we both feel that we 're making worthwhile contributions to the relationship .
""" it 's a lot more <UNK> than you might think ."
you 'll actually find that you save a lot of money by cooking your own food and doing your own laundry and cleaning .
"believe it or not , i usually spend around $ <#> per week on groceries ."
"if you do any grocery shopping , you 'll recognize that as a fairly low grocery bill ."
"( at least , it is here on the east coast where we live . )"
"if you make your own food , you know what 's gone into it ."
you know all the bugs were washed off before it was cooked .
you know the potatoes did n't have rotten spots in them .
you 're digging into some frozen <UNK> from the grocery store and you come across some odd little <UNK> - brown bit .
a <UNK> of rotten vegetable ? or a <UNK> up bug ? ?
"if you 'd cooked the food yourself from scratch , you would know ."
"i 've been a vegetarian since <#> which , not <UNK> , is the same year i graduated from high school and moved away from home ."
it 's nice to know that i 've been a vegetarian for longer than i was ever a meat - <UNK> .
my husband is not a vegetarian but he is <UNK> supportive of my diet choice .
"since the spouse does eat meat and likes that flavor , we have made some <UNK> on the kinds of foods we eat at home ."
it 's pretty heavily <UNK> and is high in fat .
"apparently , though , it 's a fairly convincing meat substitute ."
every <#> of the people i 've served this stuff to ( all meat - <UNK> ) has liked these <UNK> <UNK> products .
it 's not what i 'd probably choose just for myself but it 's a reasonable compromise .
"as i mentioned on the american <UNK> at home page , i cook most of our food from scratch ."
"for the past couple of years , we 've really been getting into indian food a lot ."
what a discovery this <UNK> was for me ! !
incredibly <UNK> and so many many different vegetarian recipes .
here are some of my favorites : <UNK> spicy indian potatoes <UNK> squash soup <UNK> .... actual recipes will appear in future blog entries !
"if you 're not familiar with indian food , do n't let these recipes scare you ."
"the <UNK> are different from what you 're used to , but once you try it you 'll be glad you <UNK> out ."
"in truth , i do n't use actual recipes much anymore ."
when you cook a lot you develop a sense for which <UNK> <UNK> best with different kinds of foods and how much you 'll need .
the best thing is to cook a lot and experiment .
"if you 're home all day , you 'll have time to do that ."
"in that case , go to a good restaurant for your meals ."
just about anything 's better than most of the prepared foods you get in grocery stores .
i have <#> question that i wish someone could answer to my satisfaction : why are people such <UNK> ?
i ca n't really relax if the house is a mess .
"if there 's stuff lying around on the <UNK> and tables , dirty dishes in the sink , <UNK> on the bathroom floor ... it just makes me tense ."
it all just seems so overwhelming that they do n't know where to begin .
it 's easier to just keep adding to the mess .
"i suppose there might be some truth to <UNK> once your place has become a big mess , it takes a bit of extra work to clean it up ."
"for these folks , then , i offer my plan for taking charge of your environment !"
the initial work of getting your mess under control will take some time so ...
"if you work , you might want to consider taking a week off ."
here 's the <UNK> 's program : get rid of your junk .
you do n't need most of the stuff you 're hanging onto .
you 'll be surprised how <UNK> it is to <UNK> a bunch of your stuff .
: do you want to be defined by your stuff ?
"once you 've cleared out the junk , organize what 's left and put it away somewhere ."
"be aware , though , that an "" easy to get to "" place does not mean a pile on the counter in the kitchen ."
"buy yourself some <UNK> or something ... <UNK> , attractive boxes , whatever ."
clean up while you cook . <UNK> and put pots and <UNK> and dishes in the <UNK> as soon as you 're done using them .
you 're already just standing there in the kitchen !
look through it as soon as you bring it in .
( you 're not going to have time to look at it anyway .
"immediately open the bills , toss the junk that comes with them , and put the bills all in a single place to <UNK> payment ."
put things away when you 're done with them .
"now that you 've got your stuff under control , you 're ready to move on to actual cleaning of your space ."
do this : vacuum everything at least once a week .
get yourself a really good vacuum cleaner with multiple settings and <UNK> .
nothing can beat a good vacuum cleaner for all - over cleaning .
get yourself a urllink <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"laugh if you will , but the <UNK> is a good product ."
but it 's the best tool for quick <UNK> - up jobs that i 've seen .
the pads are thick and <UNK> -- like <UNK> <UNK> .
it 's simple if you use a <UNK> .
i 'm actually not all that crazy for the <UNK> brand <UNK> - <UNK> .
"they do pick up the dust , but they do n't shine your furniture like good old - fashioned furniture polish and a rag will ."
put some really good music on the stereo and just ... dust .
since you 've thrown out most of your <UNK> - <UNK> it wo n't take all that long .
"( you have thrown out those goofy <UNK> - <UNK> , have n't you ? )"
fill the bathroom sink with some hot water and <UNK> .
toss in your cleaning rag to get it good and wet .
it actually only takes a few minutes to clean a bathroom using this method .
use the same <UNK> - water approach to every surface .
i learned this method of bathroom cleaning when i worked as a hotel maid a long time ago .
"if you keep up with things , it will never get out of control again . if you keep up with it"
"first of all , get rid of all that <UNK> . if , for example , you collect these "" precious moments "" <UNK>"
", here 's what i want you to do ."
gather up all those dear little <UNK> in a box .
"smash them on the sidewalk while chanting over and over , "" i will never , never again spend my money on such ugly , useless crap . """
"believe me , it may hurt at first but eventually you 'll be glad you did it ."
real wood is always always <UNK> to anything made of <UNK> - wood .
"if you ca n't afford new real wood furniture , check out the urllink salvation army or urllink <UNK> store nearest you ."
people often give away perfectly nice real wood stuff .
you can always <UNK> it if it 's in rough shape or is painted some bizarre color .
"keep in mind , too , that you do n't have to use a piece of furniture for its original design purpose ."
"if you cut the legs down a bit on an old wood kitchen table , it makes a wonderful big desk ."
an old buffet is good for <UNK> your computer <UNK> .
if you cut the legs down on a kitchen table even more it makes the best coffee table you ever had in your life .
"when it comes time to get <UNK> furniture , make sure you get something plain and subtle ."
"no <UNK> , no big flowers , no leather ."
a good way to add color to your house is to use nice pieces of art glass .
"do n't over - do it . and do n't be intimidated by the term "" art glass ."
""" art glass is just anything you 're using as a <UNK> object ( and not , for example , as a fruit bowl . )"
i have some colored glass bowls that were <UNK> cheap ( less than $ <#> each ) that are really beautiful as artistic objects .
people have a real tendency to want to line every wall with furniture and pictures .
space is a good thing and will make your home feel much more <UNK> .
"personally , i do n't care much for <UNK> or french <UNK> type <UNK> ."
"what i 've been doing for years is a mixture of <UNK> , japanese , and contemporary styles ."
"when i get around to it , i 'll take a few <UNK> of the interior of my house and put them up here for you to see ."
( i know ... the excitement is almost unbearable . )
our furniture did not cost a lot of money .
most of it was purchased from urllink ikea back when ikea was still making their furniture out of real wood .
( now they use a lot of <UNK> - wood .
"sigh ... ) to that , we added some <UNK> stuff and some <UNK> market stuff . <UNK> !"
"are people who ask , "" do n't you get bored ? "" lacking in imagination ?"
why would they think i might get bored being alone all day if not because they get bored with nothing but their own <UNK> as entertainment ?
"i could entertain myself for an eternity , i think ."
there 's a statement for you : i enjoy my own thoughts .
i get a kick out of reading books that <UNK> flights of imagination .
"i like making the connections that flower into brand new ideas , brand new ways of understanding ."
there are more <UNK> people in the world than <UNK> people . or -- maybe it just seems that way .
"i think it 's the <UNK> who ask that question : "" do n't you get bored ? """
", i was being paid to think about whatever it was my employer wanted me to be thinking about ."
"you work at an insurance company , they expect you to be thinking about insurance while you 're there ."
i could think about whatever i wanted when i was doing that job .
i 'm telling you the truth : i did some of my best thinking while cleaning hotel rooms !
"unfortunately , the pay sucked so i could n't afford to do any of the other things i really like to do ."
"the truth is , there 's no paying job on earth that would allow me to do the things i really want to do ."
my interests are simply too broad to be <UNK> - <UNK> in a career of any sort .
as an old friend of mine once said : <UNK> is for <UNK> .
"i really just need a wealthy <UNK> , i guess ."
"and , i guess , i more or less found him ."
now i have the time and -- thanks to my spouse 's income -- the money to finally do what i really want to do .
"and i do all the cleaning , cooking , and chores associated with running a household ."
"since i 'm not bringing any cash into the relationship , it seems only fair ."
"no , actually , i do n't get bored at all ."
"no , actually , i do n't get bored at all ."
"( hey , i said it was short ! )"
"in a medium pot , cover them with the water and add the whole dried <UNK> , <UNK> , and salt ."
"bring to a boil , reduce the heat , and <UNK> , <UNK> often , until very tender ."
"this will take about <#> minutes for red <UNK> , <#> minutes for peas , or an hour or more for <UNK> beans ."
"it may be necessary to add more water to prevent sticking , but only <#> cup at a time , because the final <UNK> should be fairly thick ."
"when the <UNK> are almost cooked , heat the <UNK> or oil in a small pan , add the <UNK> seeds , and cook for <#> or <#> seconds ."
stir in the onions and ginger and cook for about <#> minutes .
add the chopped tomatoes and cook for another <#> or <#> minutes until most of the liquid from the tomatoes has been absorbed .
"when the <UNK> are tender , remove and <UNK> the hot peppers ."
"stir in the onion mixture , lemon juice , <UNK> <UNK> , and salt to taste ."
"serve , passing additional <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> on top if desired ."
put a cup or so of cooked rice in a bowl and pour the <UNK> over it .
another good choice is to serve the <UNK> with <UNK> -- an indian flat bread .
"add the tomatoes and water , then the potatoes and sweet potatoes ( or carrots ) ."
"turn the heat to medium low , cover the pot , and <UNK> for about <#> minutes ."
"add the <UNK> , beans , <UNK> , and red chili paste ."
then <UNK> it and cook until the vegetables are almost done .
add a little water to the pot if the veggies start sticking to the bottom .
"add the peas and <UNK> , covered , for another <#> minutes or so ."
"use the back of your spoon to "" <UNK> "" some of the veggies into the sauce to make it sort of "" <UNK> "" like ."
* indian <UNK> powder is easy to make yourself and probably tastes better than what you 'd get at the indian grocery .
some of the seeds will probably start to pop .
"after a minute or <#> in the pan , empty the seeds into a spice <UNK> and grind them into a powder ."
i usually use an electric <UNK> pan set at <#> degrees .
"when the oil 's hot , add the <UNK> and let it <UNK> for a second or <#> . then add the <UNK> seeds and the mustard seeds ."
"when the mustard seeds begin to pop ( which should be almost immediately ) , add the potatoes ."
gently stir the potato mixture every <#> or <#> minutes so all sides of the potato <UNK> get <UNK> .
let it cook for another <#> or <#> minutes .
these potatoes are extremely delicious served with a green salad as a meal .
even my <UNK> spouse regularly asks for spicy indian potatoes and a salad for dinner !
"coat the cut <UNK> with cooking oil , place face down on cookie sheet , and bake at <#> until squash is tender ( about an hour . )"
"while squash is cooking , watch tv for a while ... perhaps an old star trek episode is on ."
"in a heavy <UNK> , <UNK> the onions until transparent ."
start <UNK> squash out with a spoon and add <UNK> of it to the pot .
"when squash is all there , add <UNK> , salt , and pepper . then pour in the vegetable stock and <UNK> <#> minutes ."
"toss the whole <UNK> - looking mess into the <UNK> , adding water if necessary , and <UNK> it into a lovely golden soup ."
this is really pretty if you dress it up with a <UNK> of yogurt or heavy cream when serving .
you can even do the extremely impressive <UNK> thing with it !
"without good quality <UNK> and <UNK> , much of your food will taste like crap ."
"( you do trust me , do n't you ?"
"also , throw away <UNK> that you have used within <#> months or a year ."
throw away <UNK> that you have n't used within <#> or <#> years .
( maybe less depending on what it is . )
they taste better if you keep them at room temperature .
grow your own food if it 's at all possible .
"you can grow very nice tomato and pepper plants , for example , in big pots on your deck or balcony ."
"likewise , <UNK> , leaf lettuce , <UNK> , and lots of other vegetables all do quite nicely if grown in a big enough and/or right - sized pot ."
"do n't use those nasty supermarket "" fresh "" tomatoes unless you absolutely have no other choice ."
"( at least , i 've assumed it 's wax ..."
<UNK> tomatoes taste better than fresh tomatoes purchased at the supermarket .
which leads me to ... buy organic vegetables .
but at least you have a better chance of knowing sorta - kinda what went into producing them .
tonight we 're having <#> of our favorites : a big tossed salad and <UNK> potatoes .
that may sound like a strange meal to you but you 'll be surprised by how delicious and satisfying it is .
"the salad it <UNK> from time to time , of course , depending upon what 's available ."
"tonight it contains <UNK> lettuce , baby <UNK> leaves , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> tomato , <UNK> onions , and <UNK> <UNK> ."
( i got a really good price on a big bag of <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> 's <UNK> club this past winter .
i store them in a plastic bag in the freezer and just take out however many i need .
they 've held up really well this way . )
i usually put butter and salt and pepper on mine .
"( mark does n't like butter -- yes , he 's very weird -- so he just has salt and pepper . )"
"i usually have a glass of wine with dinner , too ."
lately i 've been enjoying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blend .
( i think that 's what i paid for it last time . )
"( and may julia child find peace and a banquet in her honor in "" the clearing at the end of the path "" )"
the <UNK> <UNK> come frozen in a plastic bag .
smack the bag around on your kitchen <UNK> a few times to break up the <UNK> .
"when they 're smashed up enough , mix the entire bag in with the other ingredients ."
"put the mixture in a <UNK> <UNK> pan , pressing it down and into the corners of the pan ."
<UNK> more ketchup onto the mixture and spread it out with the back of a spoon to cover the top of the <UNK> .
pop it into the oven and bake it ( on the middle rack ) for <#> hour !
not - <UNK> is particularly delicious with <UNK> potatoes and/or apple sauce on the side
"as anyone who 's spent any time reading blogs can tell you , there 's a huge ego component to blogging ."
the blogger must assume that her life is interesting enough that other people will want to know about it .
she must believe that what she writes is entertaining and/or educational .
"i figure that if you 're reading this , you 're the kind of person who 'd actually like to know what i had for breakfast this morning ."
i got a great deal on some <UNK> bags of <UNK> rice at <UNK> 's <UNK> club about a month ago
and i make a batch of it probably once a week . here 's how i make it : put <#> cups of rice in a pan .
<UNK> the rice a couple of times under running water .
"once it 's boiling , reduce the heat to a <UNK> and cover the pan ."
this makes enough rice to last <#> person about a week .
it 's a fried rice kind of thing ...
cut <#> or <#> <UNK> <UNK> veggie bacon strips into half - inch pieces .
however long it takes for the onions and veggie bacon to begin <UNK> .
cover again and let cook for <#> minutes or so .
stir it all up again and toss a small handful of <UNK> cheese on top .
cover it again and let it cook <#> minutes or however long it takes for the cheese to melt .
"this is a very good , <UNK> ( well ... relatively <UNK> ) and filling meal ."
after this breakfast i usually do n't need anything to eat again until dinner time .
[ this was posted to the main site on <UNK> .
i 'm re - posting it here because it fits . ]
"i have owned a <UNK> ( a <UNK> vacuum cleaner , in case you did n't know ) since ..."
"last christmas , i think it was , that my husband gave me <#> ."
"ours is <#> of the earlier models that does n't automatically go "" home "" to its <UNK> station when it 's done cleaning ."
i have to admit : i sorta want <#> of these new and improved <UNK> !
i do use the <#> i have -- but probably not as often as i would if it were easier to charge and easier to clean .
"so ... the <UNK> does clean pretty well . and it does , in fact , save me some time ."
i very often will be cooking in the kitchen while <UNK> is <UNK> in the living room .
most of our cats are curious about it but not particularly afraid .
"the best animal - reaction came from our cat , george , who is an <UNK> aggressive beast ."
george is accustomed to having people and other animals back away from him .
it was most amusing watching his reaction when <UNK> not only did n't back away -- it sometimes went right towards him !
"you could almost hear him thinking , "" what the fu .... ? ! ?"
urllink earlier this year i happened to be in the local <UNK> and noticed that they had a big set - up for <UNK> related stuff .
i always look at <UNK> stuff because that 's when the biggest selection of <UNK> products is available .
i like <UNK> products for a couple of reasons .
"first , if it 's a dairy sort of thing , you can be sure the company did n't slip any meat into it ."
"it 's amazing the things a company will put chicken fat in , for example ."
like they 're doing you some kind of favor by sticking parts from dead animals into your food .
maybe they 're less like to spit in your food or let bugs get into it .
"this is probably just a happy fantasy that i tell myself , but ..."
hey ... it 's my happy fantasy and i 'm sticking with it .
"so , the <UNK> had this big display of <UNK> products that included big cases of <#> or <#> boxes of <UNK> for only something like $ <#> ."
it was such a good deal ... and the paper wrapping on the boxes was so pink that i bought a case .
and i ground up a couple of <UNK> from another box to put in not - meat - <UNK> ( recipe to follow some day . )
"the other boxes , though , are still sitting in my <UNK> ."
does anyone have any good recipes that use lots of <UNK> ?

the whole idea of jumping that high is just <UNK> for them .

"my mother was still alive then and , at the time , i was thinking of getting her a cat to have as a pet ."
( it seemed like a good idea at the time .
i sat on the deck stairs and <UNK> my fingers at him and called him over .
i was surprised to find that he had been let outside to <UNK> even though he was <UNK> .
i was <UNK> to later discover that he is deaf !
can you imagine leaving a deaf <UNK> cat outside to <UNK> for himself ? !
"he 'd clearly been out for a while , too ."
his <UNK> were rough and dirty and his fur -- which turned out to be almost entirely white -- was dirty .
he just hates all other animals and tries to kill them if given the opportunity .

"he 'd say , "" i do n't know whose dog this is ."
so ... ashley wound up being <UNK> at our vet 's office with a sign up saying they were looking for a new home for her .
my mother really needed a pet and ashley turned out to be the perfect match for her .
the last couple of years of my mother 's life she had this sweet little dog to keep her company and to keep her motivated .

"quite honestly , i 'm still not sure what all the fuss is about ."
why are some people so offended by the idea of gay marriage ?
do they think homosexuality is <UNK> or morally wrong ?
any concerns about the morality of homosexuality are based in religious teaching .
i have absolutely no <UNK> to people believing whatever religious teachings they want -- but law should be blind to religious <UNK> .
do they believe them to be more prone to child <UNK> or other crimes ?
homosexuals are no more likely to <UNK> children than are non - homosexuals .
do these people think gays are going to make unwanted sexual <UNK> on them ?
gay people -- like any other people -- want to be accepted .
they are not going to hit on someone they know is straight because they do n't like being rejected any better than you or i do .
i fully support the right of religious groups to deny <UNK> marriage to gay couples if that 's what they want to do .
"legal marriage , on the other hand , must be an option for gay couples ."
"just laws must be based upon <UNK> values rooted in individual rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ."
denying the tax and other legal benefits of marriage to gay couples is just plain wrong .
urllink <UNK> : bride of the <UNK> archives i really like this series .

"urllink no pain , no gain ( <UNK> ) : "" these are the sorts of shoes that <UNK> a woman into <UNK> ."

i 've been meaning to write about this for a while now .
what is it with lots of women and shoes anyway ?
"i understand that a few people were <UNK> somehow when they were children and , as a <UNK> , can only get off sexually on feet ."
these folks fall into the same category as those guys who like to dress up in their mother 's underwear .
that 's why it 's all the more a mystery why so many women insist on <UNK> - <UNK> their own feet !
... how weird is that ? ! ? !
they 're feet for pete 's sake !
i do n't have any particular problem with feet .
i do n't think they 're dirty or anything .
not <UNK> but not the sort of thing a normal person would want to pay special attention to .
"so then , what is it with lots of women and their feet ?"
i simply do not believe that the majority of men have a foot <UNK> and can only get excited by a woman who does this .
so ... women are <UNK> and <UNK> ( and <UNK> ) their own feet for no good reason .

"she screwed around with co - workers , some of them married ."
she then wrote about her adventures in her blog .
i 'm not sure her behavior even <UNK> for being called <UNK> at all .
"it was , perhaps , in poor taste ."
"sure , <UNK> <#> guys at once had to have been tricky ."
most young women can only manage <#> or <#> at once .
"the sexual revolution , now stripped of much of its feminist political ideology , has left <UNK> of young women free but confused ."
she seems like a young woman who enjoys sex .
"again , i say , so what ? sex between <UNK> adults used to be something that people got all upset about ."
people used to get all confused -- thinking that there were real moral issues attached to different sorts of sex .
are n't we over that by now ? ? ?
"are n't we past that , people ? ! ?"
they do n't see sex as sacred or even very important anymore .
"sex has been <UNK> and drained of its deeper meaning . """
the woman who sleeps with a married man has possibly demonstrated poor judgement .

so it has n't escaped my attention that some of my recent posts could be mistaken for being anti - <UNK> .
i want to assure you all that i am not anti - <UNK> .
i believe the <UNK> happened and i think it was a horrible and <UNK> <UNK> thing .
no people should be <UNK> solely because of their religious beliefs or their cultural background .
"having been the victim of a <UNK> does not , however , give a people a no - <UNK> free pass to do whatever they want ."
"if you insist on <UNK> me , i suppose you could call me an anti - <UNK> ."
"i guess that depends upon what you mean by "" right "" and "" exist "" ."
"if israel 's existence <UNK> upon <UNK> the palestinian people then ... no , i do n't believe israel has a right to exist ."
why do so many americans support israel in spite of its criminal behavior towards the palestinians ?
i think it has everything to do with guilt and -- amazingly -- anti - <UNK> .
i think people in their <UNK> thoughts go through something like this : ' oh my god !
we were denying them ( jews ) membership in our country clubs and then the nazis went and actually rounded them up and started killing them !
"if you 're anti - <UNK> , you should be ashamed of yourself and stop being that way ."
"if you 're a <UNK> - <UNK> , you 're an idiot ."

"democracy is n't the only effective or moral form of government , you know ."
i have to admit that this article is a bit confusing to me .
the writer seems to think that <UNK> of over an hour are unusual in the greater dc area .
"even then , the <UNK> on <#> was slow ."
lots of people living much closer to dc than west virginia already spend over an hour each way <UNK> .
the only reason the west <UNK> have such a short commute is because there are n't many of them yet -- their roads are n't as <UNK> as ours .

"when i first moved to virginia about <#> years ago , we would sometimes drive on <UNK> county <UNK> past the neighborhood where i now live ."
it was beautiful -- the <UNK> was n't used much and there were acres of woods and <UNK> surrounding it .
i wanted to live there but it was too expensive for us .
( my husband was still in the navy then . )
when we bought our <UNK> here <#> years ago it backed up to woods where we often saw <UNK> and <UNK> .
<#> day i looked out my <UNK> windows and saw a buck eating from the bird <UNK> tray in our yard !
of course it could n't last -- not here in <UNK> virginia where the economy is doing just fine and new people are arriving every day .
when the <UNK> came i pulled the shades down in our <UNK> and did n't look out again for a month .
it was just too depressing -- not so much because of our loss of privacy .
they left a strip of land about <#> - <#> feet wide between our neighborhood and the new development .
"and , when i compare our neighborhood of <UNK> with the newer neighborhood ..."
our <UNK> are sort of a cape <UNK> style -- not the <UNK> <UNK> that the vast majority of <UNK> in northern virginia affect .
and our streets are <UNK> and we have green spaces with mature <UNK> .
our neighborhood is far far nicer than the new neighborhood that 's behind us .
and the new <UNK> were expensive so the values in our neighborhood have <UNK> . still
we 've got some <UNK> ( they 're not really lakes ) with walking paths around them .
there 's all the shopping and restaurant options you could possibly want within very short driving distance .
there 's mass transit -- metro buses in the immediate area and a park - and - ride nearby and the <UNK> metro train station relatively nearby .
"all things considered , it 's pretty well done ."
<UNK> so the traffic wo n't get backed up anymore there .
i guess my point is this : we 've got to re - think this whole thing .
"spread people out , but destroy more wild <UNK> in the process ?"
( i do n't like being <UNK> together with other people .
i do n't like other people 's children running around in my yard .
i do n't want to look at other people 's crap in their <UNK> .
"if i do n't like it , i 'm sure lots of other people do n't like it . )"
we 've got to re - think the whole thing .
"put some of them in north dakota and montana , for example ."
most of the people who live in <UNK> do white - collar type jobs that they could do anywhere if they just had the proper <UNK> tools .
i think the federal government should take the lead on this thing .
"if the <UNK> moved to <UNK> for most jobs , though , there would n't be a need any longer for the <UNK> companies to locate in this area ."
they could be anywhere since they 'd be meeting <UNK> with their government contact people .
there are so many reasons why a move to <UNK> would be a good idea !
"reduced population <UNK> , reduced pollution from <UNK> and just think of how much more difficult a terrorist target a <UNK> federal <UNK> would be !"
"asked why she did n't report <UNK> , spencer told <UNK> that she did n't know that what he had done <UNK> abuse ."

there is no excuse -- save severe mental illness -- for the <UNK> that occurred at abu ghraib .

the blame is n't all hers ( army <UNK> .

"we had the funeral for drew yesterday , then went to the <UNK> for the <UNK> ."
every time i see a <UNK> lowered into a grave i feel so empty .
""" when i am gone "" when i am gone release me , let me go ; i have many things to see and do ."
"i thank you for the love you each have shown , but now it 's time i travel alone ."
"so if you need me , call and i will come ."
"<UNK> unknown i know that we 'll see each other again , my dear drew ."
"not much ; how ' bout you ? """
this is how my conversation with chris started this morning .
the funeral for drew is saturday . still ca n't believe he 's gone .
"my head is still spinning , and chris is so lost and hurting right now ."
"i wish i could just take chris ' pain , but i know that i ca n't ."
"when he and i decided to move our relationship forward , i do n't think he knew what he was getting himself into ."
"after the funeral , i think <UNK> and i need to get away for a few days ."
<#> august <#> - a new month has begun again !
it 's hard to believe that we are now in the eighth month of <#> .
time seemingly begins to <UNK> as we get older ; this realization is a little frightening .
<UNK> and i did a little road trip yesterday after spending most of the day with chris .
i have loved that place since i was <#> .
every summer my family would spend a week up there .
"on the coast , about <#> miles north of los angeles ."
"anyway , i digress ... we walked along the water , out onto the <UNK> and just enjoyed each other 's company ."
we then walked up state st and ate in <#> of the many <UNK> .
i love this man with all my heart and am so grateful that he is in my life .
"he is funny , kind , gentle , compassionate , and so beautiful , on the inside , as well as the outside ."
i think about how <UNK> chris is with the death of drew .
ever feel guilty for having something that someone else whom you love has lost ?
that 's describes a part of me right now .
"on the ride back , i just enjoyed hearing <UNK> sleeping <UNK> in the passenger seat ."
"my heart <UNK> with love , pride , and <UNK> ."
hold your loved ones tightly and enjoy them !
"when i think about this air supply song , i do n't know what to <UNK> ."
have i lost in love or am i lost in love ?
i 'm someone who likes to live for the day .
"do i want love to be suffering , as someone said to me today - love is suffering ! no way"
", i want to live every day happily in love ."
but is it <UNK> possible when you are constantly <UNK> by <UNK> .
"out there , when your love lets you down , at least you have your family and friends to fall back on ."
"here there 's constant despair , and an urge to escape from this island of <UNK> life ."
he expects me to feel on top of the world with that .
"i 'm human after all , so how do you expect me to react ?"
"i 'll probably read a book putting on my radio softly , hopefully sleep would invade my senses and make me happy and <UNK> ."
"tomorrow is another day , hopefully it 'll begin and end happily ."
"with the decision to <UNK> and agree to get pregnant once more , i knew the responsibility we were about to under take ."
tim knew before we were married that if we were to try for a baby that <UNK> medicine would be involved .
"we talked about it alot , before and after our marriage ."
after this visit we went onto another med . and
"shots in the hip , tim was , for whatever reason excited about giving me a shot in the rear ."
"after a couple of weeks of <UNK> , we finally had signs of adult size eggs ."
we decided to go in and round <#> up !
"with a shot of <UNK> <#> hours before the <UNK> was to take place , my <UNK> made immediate changes ."
"as the sample was being washed , to do away with any bad <UNK> , i was sitting in a wheel chair wondering what will happen ."
should we go ahead with it this time since i 'm feeling sooo terrible ?
"well we did go ahead with this <UNK> , with <#> adult eggs we had a good chance to have <#> take ."
the <UNK> she felt after a session and the extreme excitement if all goes as expected .
"with my <UNK> feeling like <UNK> are going to blow up , and the <UNK> my god !"
after laying on the <UNK> <UNK> with my legs in the air for <#> minutes ( this is not a myth )
it was time to crawl off and get into my wheel chair to go home .
"urllink microsoft <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <#> - year stock <UNK> plan , and special <UNK> to <UNK> ."
"company is confident about future growth and <UNK> opportunities , plans to provide up to $ <#> <#> in value to <UNK> over next <#> years ."
", the board also approved plans to buy back up to $ <#> <#> in microsoft stock over the next <#> years ."
"<#> , <#> , to <UNK> of record on aug ."
"the special <UNK> will be <UNK> on <UNK> . <#> , <#> , to <UNK> of record on <UNK> ."
"<#> , <#> , conditioned upon <UNK> approval of <UNK> to the employee stock plans at the annual <UNK> meeting currently planned for <UNK> ."
the special <UNK> represents $ <#> <#> that will be paid <UNK> . <#> <#> .
it is safe to make the assumption although we will try to check it that the <UNK> of microsoft are made of short term <UNK> <UNK> or cd .
"so by making something innocent , return you cash , <#> can give you the kiss of the death ."
<#> - when a pro says he made a mistake may be it was not a mistake after all .
urllink protect yourself and your <UNK> : urllink <UNK> message
"we used to do some <UNK> work for his agency , a <UNK> board ."
"but he also told me that the whole government body is freezing and cutting down on head count , <#> % <UNK> per year , or something like that ."
i wonder what would happen to all those civil service people ?
"they ca n't be possibly go to private sector and try to make a living , can they ?"
"well , they can try , but based on my past <UNK> experience with them , i doubt they can cut it ."
probably only the top <UNK> % of the staff could make it in the private sector .
"as for the rest of <#> % , well ... come on boys come to private sector and we 'll teach you a good lesson !"
"in private sector we do real work , and not just paper work !"
"we talk about real money here , not paper or <UNK> money ."
"we talk about real bottom line here , not just <UNK> targets , numbers and statistics ."
"so come <UNK> , and learn to swim while in the deep pool ! no life guard here ."
"yesterday , when i was having tea in a nearby mall , i <UNK> a conversation between a would - be supervisor and a newly hired ."
"the supervisor was telling the newly hired how she could come in tomorrow morning , by which doors , who to look for , and the dress code too ."
the sound and feeling were all very familiar to me .
it 's the feeling of starting a new job in a new place .
it just reminded me how i have n't got the feeling for a very long time .
perhaps i have stayed in my current job for a little bit too long .
perhaps i 've become more lazy and less daring as the years go by .
perhaps i have more commitment and family responsibilities now compared to my younger days .
"perhaps the economic is still not recovered yet , and no good jobs available out there ."
motivation is a key for people to be productive .
"i notice in my colleagues , who are <UNK> , that they do n't actually putting much effort to get the work done ."
"in fact , they tend to operate in a fire - fighting mode -- attending to the problem that create biggest fire ."
but lately i too found myself to operate in this manner .
"it seems like thinking and <UNK> are rewarded only with criticism and more work , without the <UNK> credits ."
"yes , there 's such thing as self motivation , but this <UNK> is hard to come by these days ."
"we are knowledge worker , we create value and make things happen ."
that 's what our managing director told us at the recent staff communication conference .
"he told us that with competing pressure from india and china , we have to <UNK> ourselves ."
project management and implementation used to be our <UNK> .
he told us that we have to move away from that and move up to the higher level of value chain .
"divided into many groups managed by engagement managers , who will have a number of account managers under him/her , depending how big the client is ."
"so when come the em and am level , all those feel - good <UNK> statements are fitting for trash bin only !"
"we are hired for our skills , knowledge and experience ."
but the em and <UNK> give us assignment and manage us as if we are factory workers .
so why pay the premium of graduates with experience if you 're not going to use what you 're paying for ?
"if it 's just a pair of hands and legs that you need , you 'll be better of hiring o - level or a- level staff ."
so is it any wonder if our clients are beginning to question our value ?
would you hire graduate with <UNK> experience to arrange for meetings and write minutes ?
"md up there , he certainly does not have any clue of what 's happening at the ground level ."
a <UNK> that worth more than a fee that we charged them .
my <UNK> - haired boss was upset over the maintenance plan document that we updating late .
so what 's so important about this document that none of us make use of it for the whole year ?
is this the quality that <UNK> was suppose to help us achieve ?
"otherwise , it would be there collecting dust until end of the year , and then we stamp it "" <UNK> "" . and start with another new document ."
now tell me that this is quality work and not wasting time .
blogger 's new text editor does n't seem to work with linux <UNK> .
"i tried with mozilla <#> and <UNK> browser , both do n't work ."
"i have to use the edit html mode , instead ."
"in fact , i 've always been windows fan ( and seems would continue to be so ) ."
"it 's my classmate who insist to install linux on my pc , so that i can try this "" wonderful "" system ."
"seems like microsoft will continue its reign in <UNK> arena for some distance future -- at least their product works , for me ."
"yes , i just want to get my work done , and not spending <#> % of the time fighting the operating system in the process ."
"i just updated our "" maintenance plan "" for this year ."
"yes , i know it 's july now :-)"
"but the truth is , if there 's no internal quality <UNK> coming up next month , i do n't think anyone would even <UNK> to update the document ."
why should we spend precious resource -- time -- on a piece of document that none would refer to for the rest of the year ?
we did some major cleaning in our apartment this weekend .
"kitchen is the most difficult to clean , with all the oil - mixed dust on top of the cabinet , it 's really difficult to get them off ."
"fortunately , we have <UNK> , which is very good to get stubborn stain to come out ."
"our kitchen is very clean now :-) sunday is almost gone , and so does the weekend ."
"i 've already bought <#> tickets for i , robot this evening <UNK> show ."
the last good movie i missed was the day after tomorrow .
i guess i 've to wait for the cd to be released .
"it 's not the same as watching in cinema , but it 's better than not watching it at all ."
silence of your cry your <UNK> and <UNK> .
"friend life is the joy of pain , and loneliness , it is sorrow and grief ."
"joy of pain tell me do you still love me , or it is to long and gone ."
"like the <UNK> in the room , where we had spend some time , till the last farewell ."
"walking along with the shadow in the darkness of despair , with the bitterness of life , you are all alone and sad ."
"it is painful and <UNK> to the soul , to be left behind , in the middle of nowhere , on the road to the loneliness ."
"i am getting gray , old , and rusty , chasing the reality ."
"it is painful and <UNK> , artificial like a drug induced sleep ."
i am still waiting for you yet anxious and <UNK> though time has <UNK> enough .
i still remember the <UNK> of you 're last smile which was so sweet and nice . just like butterflies in <UNK> .
"but this world looks very artificial to me , like an <UNK> jewelry which only <UNK> , but it is not gold ."
"but i believe our love is pure , like old wine , eternal and forever ."
"back to the <UNK> , into the shell . where you are away from the reality , which is ugly and bitter ?"
"like the drugs , which my <UNK> has <UNK> me for sleep and happiness ."
"to change the <UNK> of my blood and mind , just to make a temporary change , to block the transmission of stress ."
to console in the end and to charge with a smile .
"but tell me does the pain of being left behind disappear or gets better , or it just turns into the scar on the broken soul ."
to get even worse at the end of the time .
"seasons of the life <UNK> and painting your face , with my eyes closed ."
"wondering how to draw your eyes , with its <UNK> shades ... thinking and cursing myself , that life is so unfair and mean . which is the ultimate reality"
many seasons of the life or the death !
"as when the colors of the universe <UNK> , they turn into the spring , which is bright and colorful , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"like the colors of a rainbow , which we have painted on the sky many years ago ."
"<UNK> <UNK> of your scream , glory and <UNK> , life is the pleasure of pain ."
"separation is <UNK> , in the extreme of twilight , companion is a <UNK> of hope , and hope is a <UNK> ."
"thank god almighty , we are free at last ."
it seems like such a simple little thing - crawling .
he learned how to roll at a early age and used that to <UNK> himself around .
he crawled at about <#> <#> months which is a little late .
but i do n't remember it being a big deal .
"for abby , it 's been like a personality <UNK> ."
"well , ok , she 's still going to be abby in a lot of ways , but man , is she a lot easier to manage now ."
she loves to crawl around and get into trouble .
"<UNK> , our lab mix , has a raised table for her dog bowls ."
abby <UNK> over there at every opportunity to play in the water and eat the dog food .
"fortunately , <UNK> does a pretty good job of eating all of her food , so there 's not much left for abby ."
you go get her and she laughs and smiles .
she 's been such a little <UNK> that it is so nice to see her happy .
you can tell she 's ready for her nap because she 'll just sit in place and play with her toys .
<UNK> her up - <UNK> her in her crib and she 'll sleep a good <#> hours .
"on tuesdays , he goes over to his great aunt <UNK> 's for the day ."
we never really do too much with the kids . as terrible as that sounds
", it really is a pain to get them out of the house ."
besides i do n't think they care too much <#> way or the other .
this past weekend we saw <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> ( review to follow ) .
"it was rainy at first so we got a little wet , but came home in plenty of time for nap ."
steve 's been attempting to set up my sister 's stereo for a month now .
so he took tommy over to liz 's to get the <UNK> all hooked up .
i got to spend some time with abby which was nice .
tommy and steve got home and without much incident got a bath and went to bed .
he also woke up a little early on sunday and was a complete <UNK> all day .
another short nap but an early bedtime of 7:00 .
it was actually nice to have some time to <UNK> before going to bed ourselves .
"this morning on monday , abby started <UNK> at 5:00 which is just too darn early ."
i gave her a bottle and put her back down .
i never do this because it screws up the schedule for the rest of the day .
tommy got up like a jack in the box at 6:00 shortly after i got abby back down .
it 's like a game of <UNK> a <UNK> around here .
anyway he seems to be in a good mood .
he told me over breakfast he feels better today .
"i asked him how he felt yesterday and he said "" i felt tired yesterday ."
""" he can be very self aware in <UNK> ."
"i enjoy getting out more than they do . but to get the week started off right , we need to chill at home ."
"urllink <UNK> <UNK> was at urllink <UNK> <UNK> l for a <UNK> kids concert on saturday , july <#> , <#> ."
this was the first kids ' concert i had seen at <UNK> .
i 've been there previously for classical and pop concerts .
it 's an outdoor festival kind of place with a <UNK> and lawn <UNK> .
"for classical concerts , we usually spring for the <UNK> seats ."
my dad 's not real big on <UNK> on the lawn .
we found a spot on the lawn and spread out blankets to claim some real estate for the families that were going to join us .
tommy and i went to the <UNK> point at the gift shop .
a nice soaking rain that had been threatening all week .
of course the kids were not quite as put out as the parents .
come on - <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to splash in - what could be better .
the gift shop did <UNK> sales of <UNK> .
"about <#> minutes of rain later , the clouds parted and the sun <UNK> ."
we returned to our <UNK> patch where steve has spent the rain shower under an umbrella with <UNK> .
"we had hooked up with michelle , jacob and <UNK> ."
steve brought tommy up close to the <UNK> so he could get a look at <UNK> .
that way he did n't think we had come all this way with thousands of other people to sit around and listen to a <UNK> <UNK> best of cd .
i think he <UNK> on to the fact that it was really her .
abby even seemed to enjoy the music and start <UNK> along in her strangely <UNK> way .
the kids all around really did enjoy the music .
nothing is <UNK> than seeing a bunch of little kids jumping around to kids 's music .
"she played all of her hits - "" we are the <UNK> , """
i never thought i would be able to suffer through children 's music .
you 'll find yourself singing a tune when the kids are down for <UNK> .
"for about a year , i sang tommy "" moon , moon , moon "" every night before bed ."
"besides playing her guitar <UNK> , i did n't really notice anything different about her ."
"if you ever have a chance to see her live , i would suggest it ."
"<UNK> when thinking about art production and representation , it is therefore crucial to <UNK> these terms both <UNK> and in relation to each other . and"
"we no longer <UNK> of the public <UNK> as an entity , as <#> location and/or formation as suggested in <UNK> ' famous description of the <UNK> public <UNK> ."
"there not only exists public <UNK> ( and ideals here - of ) , but also counter - <UNK> ."
my beef with big media how government <UNK> big media -- and <UNK> out <UNK> like me .
it was losing $ <#> a month and its programs were viewed by fewer than <#> percent of the market .
so i <UNK> my house and bought it myself .
the atlanta purchase turned into the <UNK> ; the charlotte purchase -- when i sold it <#> years later -- gave me the capital to launch cnn .
both required a streak of independence and a taste for risk . and neither could happen today .
"in the current climate of <UNK> , independent <UNK> simply do n't survive for long ."
it 's not that there are n't <UNK> eager to make their names and <UNK> in <UNK> if given the chance .
the difference is that washington has changed the rules of the game .
"they wanted to make sure that the big , established networks -- cbs , abc , nbc -- <UNK> forever <UNK> what the american public could watch on tv ."
they wanted more people to be able to own tv stations .
that helped me get my start <#> years ago .
congress also passed a law in <#> <UNK> that <UNK> be equipped to receive both <UNK> and <UNK> channels .
"that 's how i was able to compete as a <UNK> station , although it was never easy ."
that 's how we were able to beam our atlanta station to homes throughout the south .
"<#> years later , with the help of an <UNK> satellite , we were sending our signal across the nation , and the <UNK> was born ."
"today , media companies are more concentrated than at any time over the past <#> years , thanks to a <UNK> <UNK> of ownership rules by washington ."
"just <#> years later , it had <UNK> to <#> percent ."
"in this environment , most independent media <UNK> either get <UNK> up by <#> of the big companies or driven out of business altogether . yet"
"instead of <UNK> the rules to give independent <UNK> a fair chance in the market , washington continues to <UNK> the playing field to favor the biggest players ."
people who own their own businesses are their own bosses .
"they know they ca n't compete by <UNK> the big guys -- they have to <UNK> , so they 're less obsessed with <UNK> than they are with ideas ."
they are quicker to <UNK> on new technologies and new product ideas .
"they steal market share from the big companies , <UNK> them to adopt new approaches ."
"this process <UNK> competition , which leads to higher product and service quality , more jobs , and greater wealth ."
"but without the proper rules , healthy <UNK> markets turn into <UNK> <UNK> , and that is what 's happening in media today ."
large corporations are more profit - focused and risk - <UNK> .
their managers are more <UNK> to <UNK> because they 're afraid of being fired for an idea that fails .
"they prefer to sit on the <UNK> , waiting to buy the businesses of the risk - <UNK> who succeed ."
"the economy will suffer , and so will the quality of our public life ."
"let me be clear : as a business <UNK> , <UNK> makes sense ."
the <UNK> behind the <UNK> are acting in their corporate interests and playing by the rules .
"but for a society , it 's like over - fishing the <UNK> ."
"when the independent businesses are gone , where will the new ideas come from ?"
we have to do more than keep media giants from growing larger ; they 're already too big .
we need a new set of rules that will break these huge companies to pieces .
"the big squeeze in the <UNK> , i became convinced that a <UNK> all - news network could make money , and perhaps even change the world ."
"but when i invited <#> large media corporations to invest in the launch of cnn , they turned me down ."
"when no <#> would go in with me , i <UNK> my personal wealth to start cnn ."
"soon after our launch in <#> , our expenses were twice what we had expected and <UNK> half what we had <UNK> ."
our losses were so high that our <UNK> were called in .
"i <UNK> at <#> percent interest , up from <#> , and stayed just a step ahead of the <UNK> ."
"eventually , we not only became <UNK> , but also changed the nature of news -- from watching something that happened to watching it as it happened ."
"but even as cnn was getting its start , the climate for independent <UNK> was turning hostile ."
"in <#> , the fcc did away with <UNK> caps altogether and raised the audience - reach cap to <#> percent ."
this was n't necessarily bad for <UNK> <UNK> ; we had already achieved scale .
but seeing these rules changed was like watching someone knock down the ladder i had already climbed .
"meanwhile , the forces of <UNK> focused their attention on another rule , <#> that restricted ownership of content ."
"in <#> , the commission pointed out , independent companies had produced a third of all network shows ; by <#> , that number had dropped to <#> percent ."
the rules essentially <UNK> networks from <UNK> from <UNK> programs that they had already <UNK> .
"this had the result of forcing networks to sell off their <UNK> arms , as cbs did with <UNK> in <#> ."
"once networks no longer produced their own content , new competition was launched , creating fresh opportunities for <UNK> ."
"for a time , hollywood and its production <UNK> were politically strong enough to keep the <UNK> - <UNK> rules in place ."
"the fcc ultimately agreed -- and suddenly the broadcast networks could tell independent production <UNK> , "" we wo n't air it unless we own it ."
this <UNK> the major political opponents of <UNK> .
"even before the <UNK> of <UNK> - <UNK> , i could see that the trend toward <UNK> spelled trouble for <UNK> like me ."
it 's difficult to survive when your <UNK> are owned by your <UNK> .
"i had tried and failed to buy a major broadcast network , but the <UNK> of <UNK> - <UNK> turned up the pressure ."
"since i could n't buy a network , i bought <UNK> to bring more content in - house , and i kept looking for other ways to gain scale ."
"in the end , i found the only way to stay competitive was to <UNK> with time <UNK> and <UNK> control of my companies ."
"big media today wants to own the <UNK> , <UNK> , water , and the <UNK> ."
"<UNK> networks throughout the <UNK> , media <UNK> were celebrated in the press and otherwise seemingly ignored by the american public ."
"so , it was easy to assume that media <UNK> was neither controversial nor <UNK> ."
"in the summer of <#> , the fcc raised the national audience - reach cap from <#> percent to <#> percent ."
hundreds of thousands of citizens complained to the fcc .
groups from the national organization for women to the national rifle association demanded that congress reverse the ruling .
"in reaching its <#> decision , the fcc did not argue that its policies would advance its core <UNK> of diversity , competition , and <UNK> ."
"first , the "" competitive presence of cable "" is a <UNK> ."
<#> percent of the top <#> cable tv stations are owned by the same parent companies that own the broadcast networks .
"yes , disney 's abc network has lost viewers to cable networks ."
"but it 's losing viewers to cable networks like disney 's espn , disney 's <UNK> , and disney 's disney channel ."
the media giants are getting a deal from congress and the fcc because their broadcast networks are losing share to their own cable networks .
"second , the decision <UNK> the "" diversity - <UNK> value of the internet . """
the top <#> internet news sites are owned by the same media <UNK> that control the broadcast and cable networks .
"sure , a <#> - person choir gives you a choice of voices , but they 're all singing the same song ."
the fcc says that we have more media choices than ever before .
but only a few corporations decide what we can choose .
"that 's like a <UNK> deciding what candidates are allowed to stand for <UNK> elections , and then claiming that the people choose their leaders ."
the <UNK> for such a cap is the same as it has always been .
a lower limit would encourage the entry of <UNK> and promote competition .
triple <UNK> the loss of independent <UNK> hurts both the media business and its citizen - customers .
"when that happens , quality <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , and democracy itself <UNK> ."
the <UNK> ratings are dangerous in a similar way -- because they scare companies away from good shows that do n't produce immediate blockbuster ratings .
"the producer <UNK> <UNK> once asked , "" you know what ruined television ? """
"his answer : when the new york times began publishing the <UNK> ratings . "" that list every week became all anyone cared about . """
"when all companies are <UNK> <UNK> - obsessed , the market starts <UNK> companies that are n't <UNK> an instant return ."
"this not only creates a big incentive for <UNK> accounting , but also it <UNK> the kind of investment that builds economic value ."
you ca n't plant something today and <UNK> tomorrow .
"had <UNK> communications been required to show <UNK> growth every quarter , we never would have purchased those first <#> tv stations ."
"when cnn reported to me , if we needed more money for <UNK> or baghdad , we 'd find it ."
"if we had to bust the budget , we busted the budget ."
"we put journalism first , and that 's how we built cnn into something the world wanted to watch ."
i had the power to make these budget decisions because they were my companies .
i was an independent <UNK> who controlled the majority of the votes and could run my company for the long term .
top managers in these huge media <UNK> run their companies for the short term .
media mega - <UNK> inevitably lead to an <UNK> on short - term <UNK> .
you can see this <UNK> in the spread of reality television .
"shows like "" fear factor "" cost little to produce -- there are no actors to pay and no sets to maintain -- and they get big ratings ."
"thus , american television has moved away from expensive <UNK> and on to cheap <UNK> ."
"we 've gone from "" father knows best "" to "" who wants to marry my dad ? "" , and from "" my <#> sons """
"to "" my big fat obnoxious fiance . """
"the story of grant <UNK> and mary tyler moore 's production studio , <UNK> , helps <UNK> the point ."
"pat <UNK> ; then , he was bought out by fox ."
loss of <UNK> <UNK> has also meant a decline in the local focus of both news and programming .
"local coverage is expensive , and thus will tend be a <UNK> in the quest for short - term <UNK> ."
"in <#> , fox television bought chicago 's channel <#> and <UNK> all of the station 's <UNK> produced shows ."
that <UNK> was n't enough to save the program .
"once the station 's ownership changed , so did its mission and programming ."
"loss of <UNK> also <UNK> the public - service mission of the media , and this can have dangerous consequences ."
"in early <#> , when a <UNK> train <UNK> near <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"according to news reports , it took them over an hour to reach anyone -- no <#> was answering the clear channel phone ."
"by the next day , <#> people had been <UNK> , many partially blinded by the <UNK> ."
"pets and <UNK> died . and clear channel continued <UNK> its signal from <UNK> in san antonio , texas -- some <#> miles away ."
"loss of democratic debate when media companies <UNK> their markets , it <UNK> our democracy ."
these big companies are not <UNK> ; they do billions of dollars in business with each other .
they do n't compete ; they <UNK> to <UNK> competition .
"i felt it in <#> , when cbs , nbc , and abc all came together to try to keep cnn from covering the white house ."
"in early <#> , the <UNK> research center found that <#> percent of americans had heard "" nothing at all "" about the proposed fcc rule changes ."
a few media <UNK> now exercise a near - <UNK> over television news .
there is always a risk that news organizations can <UNK> or ignore stories to serve their corporate purpose .
but the risk is far greater when there are no independent <UNK> to air the side of the story the corporation wants to ignore .
more <UNK> has often meant more news - sharing .
but closing <UNK> and <UNK> staff have more than economic consequences .
a smaller press is less capable of holding our leaders <UNK> .
this ability to control the news is especially <UNK> when a large media organization is itself the subject of a news story .

i think they put something in it to get you hooked ; like <UNK> or something .
there was a time when most of the men who used after - shave smelled of old spice .....
most men who wear old spice put on too much .
i do n't like the new logo they now put on the bottle .
i like the old <UNK> ship from the old days .
some things were not meant to be <UNK> with ......
a classic like old spice should be left intact .
i 'm sitting in my <UNK> .... it 's hot up here ...... turned the <UNK> off

i keep thinking about what my boss ' husband says about being a parent .... <UNK> without <UNK> .

not sure what i 'm supposed to do at this point .
guess it 's going to have to be tough love .... hopefully he does n't take that as his mom does n't give a crap about him .
wish i was with my <UNK> making purple <UNK> with <UNK> .... or watching a movie with him lying on my lap .

i had my meeting with the young film student on friday and he showed me his film .
i had forgotten how bad student films can be .
it seems that with first and second year directors you are suppose to bore the hell out of your audience and then make them leave the theatre in disgust .
it was like that when i went to school also ( almost <#> years now ) .
it was just so sad to see that <UNK> waste of time and money .
it would have been a waste of time on video let alone the expense of film .
i am still in the process of closing down a business .
<#> of the reasons for starting this blog was to connect with the image gathering community .
it 's kind of tough to do when you do n't have any new images .
"i say usual but i do n't really know , this is the first time it has happened to me ."
i was glad to see lance win the tour .
it was a lot of fun keeping up with the daily coverage .

the next <#> years if his situation is like mine will be very frustrating .
i will keep working on what i 'm going to say and post the results .
maybe i will come up with some <UNK> insight between now and tomorrow .
"i am in the process of <UNK> a business which has made it hard to get going with my "" normal "" routine ."
i have been a fan of the tour de france since greg <UNK> back in the <#> 's .
i have converted my wife into a raging lance and tour fan .

this movie takes you back to the <UNK> <UNK> conflict during world war ii .
<#> people who ca n't communicate with language <#> of whom are enemies must get along to survive .
the way the director moves through this material is truly inspiring .
"the movie is also beautifully shot , the camera never stops moving but it is not <UNK> , it moves with purpose in developing the story ."
now i do n't think i have ever called him <UNK> to his face .
in fact i am not sure i remember how he got that name .... something about back hair ?
my friend brian <UNK> is the monthly blog star .
"i will be <UNK> a new person in my life each month that <UNK> me , <UNK> me , or makes me laugh ."
let 's start with why brian <UNK> me ... brian is <#> of the most real people i have ever met .
"he is honest , <UNK> , and nice when doing it ."
"he provides for his family , financially and i know he takes his wife on dates ."
i have observed him being an excellent husband and father .
he recently took over as worship leader for our church and is doing a <UNK> job .
i felt so cared about the first week after worship he sent all of us an email <UNK> us of how proud he was .... so neat .
"he is always pushing me a little further than i want to go , and i truly feel he believes in me ..."
i can not say that about very many people .
i think brian is <#> of the best people that i know and all of you should be lucky enough to have a friend like brian .
"i have become a member of the "" check <UNK> club ."
""" no i have not started <UNK> checks in the <UNK> 's <UNK> to the <UNK> lab ... aka "" <UNK> kitchen "" ) ."

so i am kidding about the <UNK> men ... just need a little humor .
i came home on wednesday from a relaxing evening in the <UNK> to find a letter from <UNK> foods <UNK> me of a <UNK> check .
i thought that was weird since i have not <UNK> there in forever and i certainly did not spend $ <#> .
i do n't think i have ever spent that much on <UNK> am single ...
well maybe when i was a youth leader and all of those teenagers eating me out of house and home .
did i mention that this is on my closed account from wa ?
"<UNK> - <#> do not be anxious about anything , but in everything by prayer and <UNK> , with thanksgiving , present your requests to god ."
"and the peace of god , which <UNK> all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus ."
kinda funny the scripture that i have been studying for the last week and a half is perfectly <UNK> to my present life circumstances .
"i have spent the last couple of days realizing how truly blessed i am , which leads me to being thankful ."
"i have had a really shitty last year , but despite the <UNK> and flow of life i realize i always come out of it fine ."
"the god that is my very breathe , my very reason for living , is my strength ."
"i am thankful for relationships , love , truth ."
"take time this week to be thankful for your existence , purpose , and his divine beauty shining on you ."
i had not seen that movie in several years and was surprise by the <UNK> theme .
i decided to go up <UNK> to <UNK> and drove by the large building
i always looked closely at this building wondering what it was .
i saw the sign for a <UNK> church and was <UNK> .
now what i am about to write may seem <UNK> ... but i need to pose the question ...
multi - <#> <UNK> ... not really sure of the exact numbers ) building projects when there are people with no food or clothes for people in the community .
i do n't understand how we have a society in which the rich become richer and the poor become <UNK> .
i was angry when i saw that it was a church .
i am not trying to be a bleeding heart liberal but i feel something is severely wrong with this picture .
i was reading blue like jazz by donald miller again this week and he writes about problems .
"he states that the problem does not lie in the politics of the world , the church , but essentially the problem lies within us ."
"he states that the only true change , true life - giving , god - <UNK> change would have to start with the individual ."
when i have these moments of enlightenment i am <UNK> up and ready to make a change .
i harbor these <UNK> ideas of <UNK> into a better person .
"i need to give more , consume less , live a life of simplicity ."
"give to the poor , i do n't really need to buy make - up or shoes , i can give it away ."
i do n't need to drive or buy products that are not good for the environment .
"so i ask myself , how do i make changes in my life ?"
miller says that the path to joy winds through a dark valley of our own <UNK> .
i know that are times in my life when i have looked at my own crap and been so completely discouraged at my progress .
i see who i am and all that i <UNK> to be and it makes me sad that i fall so short of my expectations .
"the only thing <UNK> thing about my life is the fact that as i may be overly critical of myself , god is not that way ."
in fact he is just proud of me that i get up and make the effort to live my life and want him to be apart of that .
"in the light of that knowledge we can as eugene <UNK> says be made into our true selves , our child - of - god selves ."
"each year as my birthday comes and goes , i take a significant amount of time reflecting on the past , present , and what is to come ."
<UNK> a sense of <UNK> comes over me as i smell a familiar scent or hear a song that takes me to another place .
"these moments lead me to recall old memories , some <UNK> , others <UNK> ."
recently i has <#> of these occasions as i began to read past journal entries .
<UNK> for me has become <#> of my most <UNK> activities .
"it is a place that i bear my soul , process through emotions , and pray ."
"i write these letters to god of my pain , <UNK> , and my lack of understanding the mystery ."
"i pour out my love , gratitude , and desire ..."
when i was in middle school i had a diary .
"it always felt funny to write my thoughts , activities , and emotions to "" diary "" ."
"i remember at slumber parties we used to read each others diaries if we were "" best <UNK> .... only your bf could know the intimate details about you ."
"i remember some of the things i used to read , "" we went to the mall today , "" or "" i really want a new <UNK> ..."
""" i really wish josh mcdonald would be my boyfriend . """
josh mcdonald was my sixth grade crush who did not have a clue as to who i was until 7th grade when i became popular .
"look back at those times , now at <#> , i wish i would have kept those old pages ."
to be able to see the reality of middle school dating <UNK> it 's ugly head again almost <#> years later would be <UNK> .
"girls , i do n't think we ever grow out of our girly middle school phase ."
""" i 'll try not to continue with this <UNK> and save it for the book ."
there is still something very sacred about the contents of a <UNK> that even only your closest friends are able to know your thoughts .
even with that said i only read <UNK> from my journals to my most intimate friends ... which consists of <#> - <#> people . and
with that there is only <#> person who i would let hold the <UNK> contents and read it for <UNK> know who you are ) .
"over almost <#> years i have written in everything from <UNK> , <UNK> journals from old navy , to <UNK> from coffee shops ."
"there are moments , emotions , and <UNK> recorded in these books that would make an excellent made for t.v ."
"i read my earliest prayers and note that everything is <UNK> and pretty using big words like <UNK> , king of kings , and holy of <UNK> ."
... that is where my pain began to <UNK> into my view of god .
my self - <UNK> wounds causing me to to question whether or not he was there .
"my faith <UNK> under the weight of disbelief , so i yelled , screamed , and cursed at god ."
"he became at that point a <UNK> , lover , and a savior in a way i had not understood and still am trying to comprehend today ."
now i look back at my life over the last <#> years and i see that it is good .
i see the person that i am becoming and it <UNK> me .
"not because of anything that i have achieved , but because i can see the miracle within me ."
"i see the person i was , i am , and who i am becoming and i am <UNK> by the work of his hand ."
who ever thought he would take a <UNK> <UNK> girl and change me into who i am being <UNK> into ?
i think back to years past and all of my friendships were somewhat superficial .
"this year brought some relationships to a close , but by the closing it brought a depth of love and understanding to some that lacked ."
it also brought the emotional <UNK> to invest in new friendships .
"my friend matt , who i would say is my best friend , has taught me new things that i never thought i could learn ."
"we have fought over everything there is to fight over , <UNK> on everything , and for a period of time could not stand each other ."
i have a greater understanding of fighting for people in relationships because he fought for me .
he did not give up and now he is <UNK> the fruit of his hard labor ...
i am no longer a <UNK> of the time ) .
i guess that is a miracle ... he would say so .
"my friends <UNK> , julie , and <UNK> have all had a hand in <UNK> me into the person that i am becoming ."
"entry after entry usually includes something that <#> of them has said to encourage , <UNK> , or piss me off ."
these are pictures that were taken from my 26th birthday party .
"the picture with <UNK> , alicia , matt and i , is my favorite ."
<UNK> and matt both helped out tons to get the party ready .
they both know how stressed out i get at events that i am planning and so they were right there keeping me together .
about an hour before the party matt took over and finished getting things ready while i got dressed .
"<UNK> replied , "" this is just how she is before the party ."
"as soon as people begin to arrive she will be a completely different person ... laughing , enjoying herself ."
it is so nice to have people in your life that know you so well .
"these relationships continue to go through trials and <UNK> and each time we all learn a new meaning for words like love , forgiveness , understanding , and compassion ."
i am the person i am because of the people that play the part they are supposed to play in the symphony of life .
"each instrument , each note being played , sometimes not <UNK> , but after much practice and devotion ..."
the music is played and flows into the beautiful <UNK> that are intimate relationships .
"we 'll write some blogs on specific <UNK> , but the starting point is to take these scores seriously ."
"firstly , they are <#> more area where other people will <UNK> you , and react in the wrong way ."
"the more they soft - <UNK> , the further into outer space you go . and secondly - a <UNK> means that under stress you are directly <UNK> yourself ."
"the more you behave in the opposite mode to your underlying need , the further you are pushing what you need away from yourself ."
it is a little harder when your usual score is opposite to your needs ( and the same side of <#> as your <UNK> ) .
i would make sure <#> or <#> people close to you at work and home understand your scores in this area and the importance of meeting the underlying need .
"yes there is a problem , got to fix it , not the end of the world or even your job . """
does your needs marker ( the circle ) sit close to the centre of the life - style <UNK> ?
"if it does then the needs page in your report will simply say something like "" you are most comfortable when other people avoid <UNK> "" ."
now that need can be a great <UNK> in keeping a diverse group together .
"you will tend to <UNK> in those who go to an extreme , which will be a blessing for those whose needs lie at the <UNK> opposite extreme ."
"on the other hand - you put a value on "" balance "" that is not self - evident to others ."
"you may well find that you surround yourself with other "" balanced "" people ... and like any tendency , that can have some negative results ."
"and of course you should be aware that you may be saying "" <UNK> "" when "" action "" is what is in fact required ."
there may be times when your love of balance is the last thing your <UNK> needs .
in fact we work with <#> <UNK> where the entire <#> - person senior management group are central needs .
it still makes it challenging sometimes when they know that something approaching a radical decision has to be made .
"this blog has a web feed , available at <UNK> <UNK> - take your people to the top"
we are setting up this blog as a fast way to get <UNK> method insights up on the web for our clients .
all the time we find that issues come up in the context of individual or group <UNK> which are widely <UNK> .
come back here often to see what we are up to .
i 've included the <UNK> url because there is now a growing body of research material up there - definitely worth a look when you have time .
got someone with blue needs ( the circle on the life - style <UNK> ) in your virtual team ?
blue needs people need - above all else - a sense of connection .
this is n't to say that blue needs and virtual teams ca n't work - but it takes extra work .
"green people tend to <UNK> ; they are thinking competitive advantage and <UNK> ( unique selling <UNK> ) , and expect their <UNK> to do the same ."
"after they have gone on for a few minutes we stop them and ask the yellow person , "" is this meeting your needs ?"
are they answering the questions you have n't yet had a chance to ask ?
"so we discuss what those questions are , and then ask the green to start again ."
"some of them become amazingly tongue - tied to start with , but are often <UNK> by how quickly they can adapt ."
green people live in the now ; yellow people on the other hand regard the past as an excellent <UNK> of future performance .
"they want to know what they can expect , based on the experience of others ."
"of course , the point here applies much more generally than just selling holidays ."
"whatever our profile , once we understand another person 's needs , we can adapt our usual style to meet those needs ."
"asking people to <UNK> their needs in order to <UNK> our usual behaviour is a non - <UNK> , albeit the way most of us operate by default ."
"if we used <UNK> only to understand the needs of those we communicate with , it would still deliver a huge return on our investment ..."
"of course , ideas and execution can be <#> different things ."
"here is an example that just came up in conversation , which i have heard in various forms on numerous occasions from blues ."
""" i 'd love to have my own business ."
"but worth checking which you love - the idea of having a business , or the reality of running <#> ."
"plenty of blues do run businesses , and very successfully , but there are things those who are strongly blue find particularly <UNK> ."
finishing <#> job before starting the next - that 's red .
"in other words , finding someone to get on the phones or knock the doors is n't going to be the whole solution even if it is possible ."
"they build <#> - to - <#> relationships , for a start ."
"the sense of connection matters at lot to blues , so they are often wonderful at building a network of individual friends ."
"and <UNK> , they are creative and future - oriented people who can often see beyond the horizon or think outside the box ."
"so why not work at creating the conditions where that will happen , and at least enjoy yourself as you do it !"
there is a component score that <UNK> this area as well .
"no , not authority or structure , which is what you may have been thinking , but rather freedom ."
"a low freedom usual score suggests that you will be at your most productive fitting in and belonging , which is a <UNK> for political success ."
"this may come as a surprise - many of the politicians who stick in our minds are the ones who stand out , surely ?"
think harder - the standing out usually goes with the political wilderness - think tony <UNK> for the past quarter century or <UNK> in the <UNK> .
"generally speaking , <UNK> in a "" political "" context goes with "" paying your <UNK> "" , "" pulling your weight "" and so on ."
so low freedom usual is another <UNK> that political success is possible .
"so - you have a high ca score , coupled with low freedom usual ?"
"if your team <UNK> ( usual and needs ) is below the mid point , ie blue / yellow , you are almost certainly a low authority bunch ."
we work with a number of teams like this .
"a wise person we know described a key <UNK> of low usual authority groups as "" the dead goat under the table "" ."
low authority need across a group can also make life interesting ; this is a group who prefer leadership by suggestion and who may take offence at anything stronger .
"they are likely also to face periods of <UNK> change with some <UNK> , fearing the <UNK> of change , more than the actual changes ."
<#> key strategy is for the low authority team to learn active communication .
"that involves saying "" when you said x , i felt y ; is that what you meant to communicate "" ."
""" when you mentioned the dead goat , i felt you were blaming me for its presence under the table ; is that what you meant to communicate ? """
"i would love to see it gone , provided ... """
"why good girls always want the bad boys by laura <UNK> "" i just want a nice guy , "" women whine ."
then they date the first drunken leather - <UNK> jerk who <UNK> his drink on her dress .
"well , it 's more than just because "" nice "" is generally considered <UNK> for "" boring sex . """
here 's why some <UNK> love the <UNK> of the bad boy .
"it 's genetic all of human history - and thus , our genetic programming -- rewards those brave enough to take risks ."
"the <UNK> <UNK> died in his lonely <UNK> , while the brave <#> ventured out and survived ."
it 's all in our heads what 's so sexy - and makes us feel so good - about being with the bad boy ?
"for starters , he 's got confidence , and that 's sexy because it 's a sign of strength ."
but there 's more : dating the bad boy carries an element of risk .
and risk <UNK> the production of the feel - good brain chemical <UNK> .
we love a challenge women love to play relationship therapist ( just listen in on a conversation with our girlfriends if you need proof ) .
"in order to achieve this , we need to find a jerk to lie down on our couch ."
we love the idea of being the woman who <UNK> this mysterious man 's problems and turns him into our own prince charming .
"what to expect with bad boys , we know what to expect ."
"we 'll try to change them , it wo n't work , and we 'll be left <UNK> ."
"but , it will be entirely not our fault ."
"nice guy and does n't work out , we 're going to have to take some ownership of the failure ."
some women are just more comfortable playing the victim .
"this it is , and nothing more . """
""" this i whispered , and an echo <UNK> back the word , """
"then this <UNK> bird <UNK> my sad fancy into smiling , by the grave and stern <UNK> of the <UNK> it wore . """
"then the bird said , "" <UNK> . """
"<UNK> at the <UNK> broken by reply so <UNK> spoken , """
"<UNK> , "" i cried , "" thy god <UNK> lent <UNK> these angels he <UNK> sent thee <UNK> and <UNK> , from thy memories of <UNK> !"
"<UNK> , oh <UNK> this kind <UNK> and forget this lost <UNK> ! """
""" prophet ! "" said i , "" thing of evil -- prophet still , if bird or devil ! by that heaven"
leave no black <UNK> as a <UNK> of that lie thy soul <UNK> spoken !
leave my loneliness <UNK> the bust above my door !
"take thy <UNK> from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! """
it is my goal to scare the hell out of the neighborhood this year and i think i have the perfect plan . .
. so let the journey to hell begin ! !
", i figured there was no use in staying home by myself when i could easily impose on my family to entertain me ."
"naturally i visited urllink the <UNK> <UNK> , and later that evening had drinks and dinner with <UNK> , gary , and my mom ."
"<UNK> mentioned that if we wanted to , we could <UNK> her <UNK> of <UNK> yarn at their house ."
"well say no more ... we were there in a flash , and suddenly i 'm the proud owner of <#> shopping bags full of yummy yarn ."
"hey , stop your <UNK> .... this is a big deal for someone who would 've needed <#> or <#> years to <UNK> so many <UNK> ."
"having <UNK> the art of the i - cord ( yes folks , i figured it out ."
", i now pause for a moment to reflect on projects past ."
"with a lot of finishing help from <UNK> of urllink <UNK> <UNK> fame , i made this <UNK> from the <UNK> summer <UNK> using their cotton <UNK> yarn ."
"i <UNK> it for joan and <UNK> , <#> of my very favorite gal - pals , and they <UNK> about it !"
definitely makes me feel better about things after the i - cord incident .
urllink urllink <UNK> detail originally uploaded by urllink the <UNK> <UNK> .
this kind ! here 's a detail pic of my current project : a tank top from the <UNK> <#> issue of <UNK> knitting .
i 've tried following a couple of different <UNK> ...
why else would they call it an idiot cord ? ? ?
urllink urllink color detail originally uploaded by urllink the <UNK> <UNK> .
"you 're thinking , "" an <UNK> <UNK> ?"
"what , did she pick up a couple of sticks and a ball of yarn <#> day , <UNK> them around and suddenly create a pair of socks ? """
but i think you could say that it 's in my blood .
"the journey began on may <#> , <#> ."
"after months of planning and hard work , my sister - in - law <UNK> opened her urllink yarn shop in red bank , nj ."
"i would n't have missed this event for the world , so i drove in from pennsylvania to join the <UNK> ."
"and as i sat at her beautiful <UNK> table surrounded by <UNK> of yarn , i suddenly found myself learning to cast on"
"<#> months and <#> projects later , i have seen the light and then some ."
so come along with me on my journey to learn about all things knitting .
urllink urllink mom knitting at our favorite <UNK> .
"my routine was really thrown off with john at the <UNK> all week , and to make matters worse , work is really getting to me ."
"so , back to my tank top ( must complete before we leave ) : the knitting is finished !"
"just have to <UNK> it together and , * <UNK> * , block it ."
"this will be the first <UNK> i 've blocked , and i 'm praying to the knitting <UNK> that all goes well and that it actually fits me afterwards ."
"meanwhile , i 've started a <UNK> scarf for my friend <UNK> ."
"it 's the same as the <#> shown in debbie <UNK> 's very <UNK> book urllink "" stitch ' n bitch : the <UNK> 's <UNK> "" ."
"it does n't look like much yet , but very soon i 'll be posting the finished product ."
"this scarf is warm , practical , and incredibly fun to knit ..."
i just hope <UNK> likes it as much as i do !
"i could start every blog that way , could n't i ?"
let me just say that he is the <UNK> person i know .
most people have that thing in their brain that keeps them from saying certain things .
"so when i said , "" i was bored at work ."
"i did n't have anything to do , "" he says without <UNK> , "" damn , me too !"
"i should have called you so we could beat off together . "" um ... what ? !"
"brad gets the quote of the day , too : "" you are dead to me now ."
"lucky for you , i 'm into <UNK> . """
q : what 's the difference between a priest and a <UNK> ?
a : a <UNK> wo n't come on your face until you 're at least <#> .
he said he wanted to do those things to brad .
"of course , i 'm not surprised by anything phil says ."
"once we were in a crowded mall and he asked , "" if we were gay , would you date me ? """
""" so he started saying , loudly , "" you would n't date me ?"
all the teenage girls looked at us funny as i ran out of that store .
it 's no wonder i 'm not in therapy .
i looked it up and those things do n't have official names .
"the <UNK> site only calls them "" <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i asked the girl who sits beside me , but when i said , "" spreading the legs apart "" and i giggled , she walked away ."
then he suggested that it be <UNK> <UNK> icing so i would enjoy it more .
"and so that person could "" ice my <UNK> . """
"ok , so which <#> of my friends was i talking to ?"
<#> . <UNK> trying to send me to houston .
"ok , something i wrote over on <UNK> got me thinking ..."
the guy that drove his truck into the <UNK> 's and shot people ?
"<UNK> get mad , they just shoot you right there ."
i can only think of a couple of <UNK> serial killers .
but we do n't usually keep <UNK> full of heads or have boy bodies buried under their house .
<#> . phil calling me to say he wants to give me a pink sock .
<#> . phil saying he was going to play my pink sock like a <UNK> .
"i 'm just an innocent ... dude , if you do n't stop laughing , i 'm going to hurt you ."
what i 'm trying to say is that me being innocent is ...
you do n't know how hard it is to be innocent ...
"not that kind of hard , you dirty bastard ."
see ! that 's what i 'm talking about .
i do n't want to put it in my mouth ! dude !
why do you always have to make things so dirty ?
"stop being queer ! dude , stop touching me like that !"
"i 'm so going to kick your ass ! kick , not lick ! and"
no i do n't want you to <UNK> my leg !
"no , you 're gay , not me , so i 'm not playing this game ."
"no , i 'm not playing with your "" <UNK> "" either ."
"well , i 've been saying it would be really easy to do , and i guess i was right ."
someone came into the agency last friday and stole <#> of the big <UNK> <UNK> from <#> of the executive offices .
they say there were <#> of them and that they came in the side fire doors at <UNK> pm and were out the same doors by <UNK> pm .
"the funny thing is , people were still here !"
i 'm just jealous that it was n't me .
"well , ok , not on my hands ... on my tire ."
"i was driving down the road , singing along with tears for fears , when a big <UNK> ran into the road ."
i <UNK> the wheel to the right and hit the brake .
i know this because when i looked back in my mirror it was doing <#> of those <UNK> back <UNK> in the middle of the road .
i am reminded of the time back in college when kicked a dove .
i did n't know it was just going to sit there and let me kick it !
i was walking to class across the main mall and there were birds everywhere .
i stared walking through a bunch of them ... and i just kicked <#> .
i could feel the little breast bone through my shoe !
it kinda went up in the air and <UNK> a bunch before it took off .
"man , i got some death looks from these girls that had seen the whole thing ."
"i looked at them and said , "" i thought it would fly off ! """
"so i go to phil 's last night , you know , to go out to eat and watch a movie ... and what do i get ?"
he said so many nasty things to me that if i repeated them i would probably get <UNK> by the fcc .
i wo n't even begin to tell you what he wanted to do with my mouth . and what set him off ?
remember when i said none of my friends are gay ?
"by the end of the evening , he was asking me to shoot him in the head with his gun ."
i think i would rather shoot him in the knee .
"i mean , watching him suffer is actually kind of fun ."
"last night i had the "" cowboy burger "" at <UNK> 's ."
it 's like a whole cow between <#> <UNK> .
with a little bit of pig in there to boot .
"but yet , there 's a cold front coming in ."
tomorrow it 's supposed to be in the <#> 's all day .
"um ... if that is n't a sign that jesus is coming , nothing is ."
"<#> night , pete almost <UNK> on brad 's <UNK> ."
( i added that because i have n't said anything about pete yet . )
"i was talking to my friend , brad , on the phone not too long ago ..."
"he let me talk to his <UNK> friend ... who is apparently irish , because he spoke with an accent ."
"i told brad to kill the <UNK> , but brad said , "" no , i need him ."
""" i realized that with brad in my life , i 'll never run out of blog material ."
"our conversation ended when he started <UNK> a lot , <UNK> and then got really sleepy ."
and i ... am soon to be unemployed .
"oh , if anyone out there has $ <#> <#> dollars they can loan me , i would be most grateful ."
"back in the day , i liked to drink ."
"after work , me and my friends would make our way down to the <UNK> p every monday , because monday sucked . and"
"every tuesday , because there was nothing else to do on tuesday . and every wednesday , to celebrate making it halfway through the week ."
"and every friday , because you 're supposed to drink on friday ."
( we never went on thursday . because that was good tv night . )
i 'd order a pitcher of <UNK> <UNK> and that was all the dinner i needed .
"these days , and hundreds of <UNK> <UNK> later , i ca n't drink so much ."
"but , i 've dedicated <#> night to drink ."
"now all my drinking <UNK> are gone , and i go drinking with scott . back in the day"
( insert <UNK> - spiral sound effect here ) now he can drink me under the table .
the <UNK> at <UNK> - bars know his name .
and he often has to get me to go out to drink with him .
it has to be a sign of the <UNK> .
so i just came back from drinking with scott .
"you see , he wants to get the maximum amount of <UNK> possible out of her ."
"god , i miss those <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ."
i think i 'm against that happening . on that topic ...
"you know ... because a "" boy "" could never afford to keep me happy ."
but in the back of my mind i was thinking ...
", i 'm old , but i still have a sweet ass ."
"oh , and my <UNK> radio scripts went over big ."
now i have to do a lot more of them .
today 's against : ( all the things i 'm against today ) <#> .
"i told him i 'd change all their names , but i lied ."
"my other friends are phil , scott , <UNK> , pete and <UNK> ."
"sure , there are others , but these will be the main characters of the book i plan to write <#> day ."
"i do n't know if anyone would buy it , or believe it ."
"brad made me set up this blog , then was afraid of what i 'd write ."
i 'll stay away from all the sex stories ... especially since none of us have any .
"anyway , i have to go write some bad radio scripts now ."
"bad part is , i know they 'll all get killed , but i have to write them anyway ."
link is the group that was formed to save the agency .
<UNK> together by the un - <UNK> todd <UNK> .
"i mean , these guys are making a shit load of money , but they have no real clients ."
"oh , sure , there 's jean connection and <UNK> records in dallas . and"
but i do n't think stores are paying those big <UNK> .
"actually , this week i found out what they 've been working on ."
and they 're all displayed in the art gallery area of the agency .
all i have to do is make the check out to link !
so that 's what a $ <#> a year art director does .
"* deep breath * it 's ok to hate these people , right ?"
"yes , he called to tell me that he had gotten laid this weekend !"
"well , actually , he told me that he was in his local target and saw a really hot mom ."
"he hid in the aisle next to her and <UNK> <#> off while <UNK> at her through the <UNK> . """
"for me , "" he said , "" that 's close enough . """
"i 'd shake your hand , but ... you know ."
"ok , so she 's done some bad stuff before . but"
i do n't know what to do about it .
but it all worked out for the better ...
<UNK> <UNK> up the cord on my mouse .
"she used to do that kind of stuff a lot , but she 's old now ."
maybe she 's telling me i spend too much time on my computer .
so i went mouse shopping ... and got a cool wireless <#> !
( it was actually cheaper than the regular apple <#> . )
and while i was there i looked around ... and got a cheap dvd player for my bedroom .
"in the end , i guess i should thank my cat ."
just as soon as she 's off life support .
my head feels like it 's going to pop .
worth with my friend tina and took an afternoon nap .
"well , at least today was n't a total waste ."
"you see , brad gave me another <#> of his tips on women ."
"i told him about the really , really , really hot mom in hr that tried to flash me on the highway ."
"( was n't my car , so she flashed a stranger . )"
so what did brad have to say about that ?
we 're doing a pro - <UNK> project for some rich old dallas ladies that run the <UNK> baron 's ball .
<UNK> that do a fund <UNK> thing for cancer .
we have to design their look and the cover of their auction book and all the printed material they do .
"this year 's theme is "" <UNK> and <UNK> "" because <UNK> nelson and <UNK> <UNK> are singing for them ."
"stupid theme for a party , but whatever ."
"anyway , they loved all the covers that the art director did ."
"<#> uses this really old , <UNK> texas flag ..."
and she did a music theme with a guitar and texas flag .
"but then , <#> of old ladies got an idea ... how about a cover that uses a <UNK> theme ?"
"because , "" she really likes horses . "" um ..."
"then they started talking about putting <UNK> into the concepts that were shown , but the art director put a stop to that ."
now she 's trying to do a quick comp with <UNK> for tomorrow 's meeting .
and you know that 's the <#> they 'll pick .
you know you’re in trouble when you wake up and you don’t know where you are .
it ’s worse when you can’t move your arms and legs .
"hmmm , i think i had too much to drink last <UNK> shit !"
i remember meeting <#> of the most beautiful women in the world last night .
it was like a <UNK> romance you’d see on tv .
after that we went to the nearest <UNK> <UNK> island and ate <#> <UNK> each .
"i mean , after what i just did to her mouth in the men ’s room , i felt obligated to marry her ."
there was the smell of leather . somewhere in the back room a cd of kenny rogers was <UNK> and things get <UNK> from there .
for a second there i thought i was tied to her bed .
that would have been the end of our relationship .

you know what i hate about advertising ? clients .
so a while back i had to write an ad for texas instruments .
it was hard for me because it was about technical stuff like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> burn - in test <UNK> .
"but , i did my research and wrote the best copy i could ."
"so , we get the change notice from the client this morning"
""" we are lacking buzz words in the copy ."
"examples of words we came up with include ' cutting edge technology , ' ' leading edge , ' and ' next generation ."
"' can the ad agency 's writer help us out here ? "" um ..."
so that 's why they kicked this ad back ?
because i did n't use enough <UNK> ' buzz words in the copy ? ! ?
"yeah , i got some buzz words for you , mr ."
i am happy to report that i had a nice weekend .
"i did n't go lay out by the pool ... in fact , i did n't do much of anything ."
i did clean my apartment ... but i always do that .
that has william h. <UNK> ( i think ) and <UNK> <UNK> in it .
"i liked it , but i kinda figured out the ending half way though the movie ."
"that 's not to say it did n't have other big surprises , because it did ."
and it did scare the poop out of me a couple of times .
"but , with that m. night <UNK> guy , you know a good ending is coming ."
so i ruined the movie for myself by trying to figure out what the ending would be .
i went to taco <UNK> to get me some <UNK> and chips and a coke .
"while i was there ( i went inside ) , i saw a guy with a <UNK> hat ."
"<#> minutes later i was trying to get out the door with my food , but he kept talking to me ."
the lesson here is to always use the drive - thru .
i told my mom that you still have hot sauce left from the last time she sent some .

"no , i do n't know what 's wrong with him ."
"i think the most interesting part of the conversation was when he asked , "" hey , have you seen that <UNK> commercial with that <#> year old grandmother ?"
he finished his thoughts on this subject by saying that this <UNK> commercial is great porn . because it 's something you can watch with your parents .
i would just like to say i love all my friends .
"ok , so last night , scott not only drank , he smoked ."
"to put this in perspective , it would be like a catholic watching the pope have anal sex with a <UNK> whore ."
"the band ( <UNK> ) was good , <UNK> was there with us and we drank a bunch ."
<UNK> was trying to get me to go talk to this <UNK> - looking black girl .
i bet she could have ... um ... shown me a few things .
i 'm sure my eyes were red during my interview this morning .
she said the boss guy was on vacation . then
why the fuck did she ask me to come in ? !
now i 'm stuck being dressed up for the rest of the day .
"well , jeans and shoes , but to me , that 's dressed up ."
"oh , <UNK> had the quote of the night ."
"scott said something about only being a "" little white trash . """

"ok , so i was talking to ... my friend ... and we were discussing a very important matter : dirty girls ."

in this hour <#> of the <UNK> ’s foremost lines of attack is to bring <UNK> upon god ’s people .
it is very important that we follow our conscience and walk a life void of offense .
walk <UNK> and walk <UNK> of our calling . if we fall short
", admit it , get up and try again . but do not cover it , for what is done in secret shall be shouted from the house tops ."
"if we have been <UNK> accused , we must identify that it is the season for such ."
"don’t you know that if they accused jesus , so shall they <UNK> us ?"
"fear not man , rather fear god ’s <UNK> ."
delight god and you have nothing to fear .
"the <UNK> do not comprehend , neither will they until it is too late ."
so let the <UNK> go and trust god to bring you all the way through it .
realize that god give honor to who honor is due .
"yes , god will honor you , but it may not be in the manner in which you choose or to whom you may choose ."
"you can not direct the will of man , so let their response go ."
for good reasons god 's holy and wise purpose does not permit him to grant every <UNK> just as it is asked .
"until we have properly responded to god and his word , he can not <UNK> us with his powerful resources ."
prayer is request to a personal lord who answers as he knows best .
we should not think that we will always have success in <UNK> the things for which we ask . in his wisdom
", god hears and answers in the way that is best for us ."
"dedicated action christ 's example does not require us to withdraw from society , but to <UNK> service to the needy in a spirit of prayer ."
"he <UNK> over jerusalem in compassionate prayer , and then he went into the city to give his life a <UNK> for many ."
"authentic prayer will be the source of courage and <UNK> , as it was for the <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"i 'm just , a nobody , trying to tell everybody , about somebody who can save anybody ."
"when god <UNK> to fill a soul , he first makes it empty ."
"god has <#> <UNK> , <#> in the highest heavens and the other in the <UNK> heart ."
humility will do several things for you : <#> . take you away from the shadow of yourself . <#> .
keep you from a sense of over <UNK> <UNK> <#> .
<#> . save you from the desire of <UNK> yourself .
"<#> . keep you from the "" center stage "" mentality ."
save you from <UNK> to be the object of observation .
"beloved , we must <UNK> that humility is not measured in <UNK> ."
god sees the heart and others see the glory .
"humility is the recognition that others have gifts we need , and that our lives can not be full without the operation of the entire body ."
god has made us a team member and we can not function without others around us .
"no matter how gifted we are , we will always need others ."
god has made it that way so no member in his body can <UNK> of independence and live on its own .

thanksgiving are we <UNK> because we think we have not received what we deserve ?
"but if we got what we "" deserved , "" we would be <UNK> because of our guilt ."
"as <UNK> , we are not people of god by nature ."
we have no claim upon his mercy or grace .
"nevertheless , he has forgiven our sins , granted us acceptance as his people , and given us his righteousness standing and a new heart and life ."
"<UNK> marks the <UNK> , "" because , although they knew god , they did not <UNK> him as god , nor were thankful "" ( romans <UNK> ) ."
god has been at work on our behalf in countless ways .
"so in everything , even for the discipline that is unpleasant , we give thanks ( <UNK> <UNK> ; <#> <UNK> <UNK> ) ."
"praise though it is difficult , start with praise ."

oliver and his <UNK> role in the <UNK> of my creative life .
( hence the title of this post . )
"<UNK> : <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
<UNK> : <UNK> suddenly quitting after i had just typed a long blog entry without having saved it .
<UNK> : trying to remember html tags when i have n't published a web page using anything but <UNK> 's <UNK> interface in years .
delight : <#> guilt - free days of post - semester <UNK> spent doing little or nothing productive .
delight : sleeping more than <#> hours a night .
( although i admit that my body has become so accustomed to the short shift that i actually feel better with less sleep than more . )
"delight : discovering that <UNK> for mac supports <UNK> blogging , so i do n't have to remember those html tags for <UNK> , linking and <UNK> pictures ."
this means i 'll be more likely than not get on with my blogging <UNK> .
but i think i 'll take a nap first .
on saturday july 24th our daughter came into the world .
she weighed <UNK> and was <#> inches long .
<UNK> came to the rescue and everything turned out real well .
she came to the world at <UNK> in <UNK> hospital .
the moments leading up to the delivery were filled with prayer and excitement .
olivia means peace and we wanted to believe that the peace of god would fill the whole event .
david neil stayed with the <UNK> during the birth and did real well .
"i have been in jackson ms for the past few days attending my little sister 's high school graduation , seeing distant relatives and catching up with old friends ."
"the night before i left <UNK> <UNK> , brett gave me several cds <UNK> full of urllink <UNK> youth 's music ."
i 'll begin by saying that i 'm not a big folk music or <UNK> <UNK> music fan . while <UNK> certainly can not be classified as either
", those seem to be <#> of the biggest influences in the songs i have ."
"i 've always said that i do n't like bands , i like songs ."
there are about <#> - <#> songs on these <#> cds that i see myself listening to for the <UNK> future .
that ai n't bad considering the fact that i only heard of this guy <#> days ago .
<UNK> ( to <UNK> really dig the goth - folk .
"the record opens up with a <UNK> track , "" bride of the <UNK> "" ."
it 's <#> of the songs that i will keep in my musical <UNK> .
"the next track , "" katie called me <UNK> "" , is a lot less <UNK> ."
it is a <UNK> song that the urllink <UNK> really seemed to like .
"<UNK> toys with religious <UNK> on the tracks "" <UNK> jesus "" and "" <UNK> light "" ."
"of the <#> , i think that "" <UNK> light "" is superior <UNK> ."
the former comes off as the indie - folk equivalent to something a shock - <UNK> would pull on air . or
""" virus "" is perhaps my favorite track ."
this song ( along with the title track ) will stick with you .
the album ( according to the official website ) was released on <UNK> records .
<#> <UNK> mentioned the quality of the <UNK> and expressed a desire to see more releases from the label .
i wish brett would fill us all in on the rise and fall of the label .
this is probably my least favorite album of the <#> i have .
"<UNK> goes <UNK> on most of these tracks , and there is a <UNK> lack of vocal effects ."
"there are no "" bad "" songs , but some of them do fall into the "" <UNK> "" pile ."
"track <#> , "" we dream in <UNK> blue "" is my favorite on the cd ."
"containing lots of odd images and dripping with sarcasm , the song reaches a <UNK> with <UNK> asking "" oh god what have you done to me ? """
emotional music does n't have to be whiny .
""" no more shoulders "" is the most radio - friendly song on the disc and is definitely a keeper ."
it is <UNK> and honest -- no <UNK> here -- while being quite accessible .
i can easily imagine this song being <UNK> from <UNK> girls ' cars and being played at high school dances .
"of course , this might be because i have a weird imagination ."
all of the songs are quite <UNK> and most of them have a rather <UNK> tone .
"i recommend it even if i myself will probably only listen to "" we dream in <UNK> blue "" with any <UNK> ."
"i read a lot of his <UNK> , <UNK> stuff when i was a <UNK> , checking the books out from the library in <UNK> ."
it would be cool to <UNK> this <UNK> .
"it was the <UNK> stuff on the <UNK> triangle , <UNK> , <UNK> , and in particular the actual book the <UNK> ."
"i have not recognized that many names in the program , but john <UNK> and <UNK> smith are among the ones i do know ."
"there are quite a few not - quite - authors as well , like terry jones of monty python and robin <UNK> of the incredible string band ."
i 'm too much of a <UNK> to <UNK> the importance of the rest without help .
"like <UNK> 's , my sister <UNK> from high school today ."
"instead of this <UNK> up all kinds of emotional baggage , it <UNK> me the opportunity to have a good , innocent , fun time ."
"i jumped on a moon walk ( or space jump ) , i went on a <UNK> hunt , and i laughed like a little girl all day long ."
i 'm glad my sister is not tied up in a lot of petty high school drama - <UNK> and is able to cut loose .
there seems to <#> members in <UNK> <UNK> today .
<#> books have been released into the wild in the past couple of weeks .
"i 'm not keen on many of the locations that these people pick either ... walmart , sporting goods shops , and computer gaming shops ."
few of the books released seem to be picked up by anyone who might care to report them back to <UNK> .
that 's even more <UNK> than whatever <UNK> i have towards other people 's tastes .
i 'm still trying to figure out what i 'm doing with a copy of ' the secret teachings of all ages ' on my desk .
"it seemed like a great thing to order a few weeks ago , but i have no memory of discovering it ."
"it simply popped into my head that i must acquire this book , with no <UNK> <UNK> ."
the author is as <UNK> as a blank <UNK> to his <UNK> work as <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> to his <UNK> stories .
the only interest he had was in maintaining the <UNK> of the catholic church .
"that is not the act of a moral man , but a politician absorbed in <UNK> power ."
"if he had any integrity , he would have <UNK> the <UNK> and continued his <UNK> in <UNK> ."
"this ' evidence ' that he saved any number of jews proves nothing , as his other actions define that he was playing both ends against the middle ."
"he made some <UNK> remarks <UNK> <UNK> , not even specifically against the jews or <UNK> the nazis , as the catholic <UNK> were being <UNK> as well ."
"a religion <UNK> be about making a <UNK> stand about right and wrong , not <UNK> moves to remain in an <UNK> position ."
compromise is not so easy for those who <UNK> <UNK> .
modern christianity is just a <UNK> version of the worship of <UNK> .
"according <UNK> , what would be the most <UNK> honest option ?"
i just realized that the link to the message board provided below ( re : <UNK> and the <UNK> ) was thrown out there without any ceremony .
it is run by <#> of the guys protecting us from terrorism on our <UNK> ....
that 's <UNK> take a peek into the mind of a <UNK> <UNK> .
it has a message board i have <UNK> for a year or so .
"i made my "" internet bones "" among these guys , and the urllink forums are definitely worth a look - see ."
".... <UNK> is urllink <UNK> , that unbelievably cool <UNK> in michael <UNK> 's urllink the revenge of the rose ."
"the "" <UNK> kid "" will discover <UNK> <UNK> the northern <UNK> ...."
"my baby sister has just recently graduated from the slightly <UNK> mississippi school for math and science , a boarding school for gifted high school students ."
this has affected me much more than i would have thought if you had asked me a month ago .
"it does n't happen that often , but sometimes i just get surprised at how strange i can be ."
"my first reaction to the news was along the lines of "" eh , whatever , move , i ca n't see <UNK> "" ."
"afterwards , however , it really began to sink in ."
"i understand that i am very fortunate to have a sister as beautiful and wonderful as dana , and i also value the relationship we have ."
"so , the pride i felt came as no surprise ."
"the emotional baggage snuck up like a ninja , though ."
"the issues brought up are <UNK> and <UNK> , but also <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as follows : <#> ."
i think it would make the intense fear of <UNK> somewhat easier to deal with .
"call me strange , but i really worry that there is nothing after death ."
i would much rather burn in the southern baptist lake of fire than cease to be .
"that is enough of that . <#> . """
what if dana sucks a pee - <UNK> this <#> is probably self <UNK> .
"i do , however , have a few things to add ."
"dana has always been very intelligent and confident where it matters , but every virgin i knew going into college was promptly <UNK> ."
"i 'll admit that was fun , still the idea of someone using her like that really gets under my skin ."
i 'm going to be a nervous father someday .
""" i should be getting a bachelor 's about now ..."
"i guess this is a <UNK> point , but it <UNK> ."
"i 'm pursuing a career i absolutely love , but it would have been nice to be the first in the family to have a <UNK> degree ."
"oh well , she 's going to get a <UNK> , so we 're ok ."
"i do n't think the <UNK> "" fish out of water "" has ever been more apt in the history of the world ."
so i 'm going to stick with what i know .
what i know is that urllink <UNK> is brilliant .
i do n't think that anyone who has actually heard them can have the confidence to call them a crap band .
"you may not like them , but respect is due ."
we finally begin to get to the meat of the matter .
"this basic idea has been <UNK> by many , including native chinese buddhist <UNK> in reaction to alan <UNK> ."
"regarding the "" catholic church <UNK> <UNK> "" party line , i have already argued the issues urllink here ."
begin with post # <#> and proceed ad <UNK> ...
"we shall definitely talk religion , my friend , but i fear i must <UNK> to my associate , who has a few things to add ."
"also , <UNK> ai n't all fire and <UNK> ..."
"the <UNK> : i think he is <UNK> genius . but again , i <UNK> to my <UNK> ...."
"<UNK> ! in <UNK> about trying to figure out who this <UNK> character is , i realized that he 's mentioned in that urllink <UNK> times piece on <UNK> ."
"with mention of an underground city of <UNK> , visions of hollow earth <UNK> to mind , and i started seeing <UNK> nazis everywhere again ."
"i even ran across urllink a thread on <UNK> that made me more suspicious of <UNK> , even though his name does not seem to be mentioned ."
"nope , not a bit of that is relevant , but hollow earth stuff is just <UNK> ."
"fortunately , there 's urllink a slightly less insane reference to <UNK> with an actual connection to <UNK>"
"it 's even dragging in <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , and the ' tao of physics ' ."
"no , i have n't <UNK> all of bill 's <UNK> , but we already know we 're on different sides off many arguments ."
i 'm a hardcore liberal who sincerely believes that <UNK> is an absolutely crap band .
the christian establishment has committed too many <UNK> errors and pointless <UNK> to be trusted as a spiritual champion .
"members of the establishment may be sincere in their desire to make a better world , but liek that jesus guy say , chop that rotten tree down ."
"the catholic church <UNK> , possibly even actively supported the nazis during <UNK> ."
"the nazi <UNK> of the <UNK> only <UNK> my <UNK> to the <UNK> , no matter how suspicious i am of them ."
"i am only reading the reviews of the books on amazon , and some quickly <UNK> up pages to find out who these cats bill is <UNK> are ."
"in <UNK> ignorance , i have doubts about the arguments of this <UNK> character ."
"as for his fear of democracy being an appeal to the law of the <UNK> force of matter , bullshit ."
this sounds like the words of a <UNK> of divine right .
are you really willing to say <UNK> are inherently better and more true than a painting or photograph ?
"in case all of you "" normal people "" have n't noticed , brett and i have recently become obsessed with the history of <UNK> societies ."
"for me , this is in part a delayed reaction to questions raised during my visits with a monk last summer ."
"i have lots of friends in <UNK> , <UNK> the town made popular by <UNK> man 's brief time in the <UNK> ."
"stunned beyond rational thought ( and having studied and greatly admired eastern <UNK> for quite some time ) , i decided to visit ."
"the <UNK> was <UNK> by <#> elderly gentleman , father <UNK> ."
i was very impressed with his <UNK> and depth of knowledge .
"as i said , he was quite smart and knew a lot about the history of christianity ."
"he had spent years in the holy land and had "" learned and forgotten <#> languages . "" he is still <UNK> in french and <UNK> ."
"<#> thing that struck me as odd , however , was the fact that our conversation continually turned back to <UNK> ."
"he is convinced that the <UNK> have "" <UNK> "" the highest levels of the catholic and <UNK> churches ."
"my first reaction was to disregard all this as paranoid conspiracy theory , but some of his comments stuck with me ."
"i did a little ( very little ) research and discovered , for example , that <UNK> ."
a balanced look at the facts can be found urllink here .
"i recall telling john that i wished there was a non - paranoid , conspiracy - connected history of <UNK> ."
my reading of urllink <UNK> 's <UNK> has only <UNK> this wish .
could a man otherwise quite <UNK> and level truly be a paranoid conspiracy <UNK> ?
"and for that matter , is the very idea of <UNK> "" in this day and age "" an <UNK> and silly concept ?"
i was into the <UNK> <UNK> when i was obsessed with robert <UNK> wilson 's urllink <UNK> .
"was his book about <UNK> and early russia real , a prank , or insanity ?"
and what the hell was he doing in <UNK> ?
i 'm also surprised to see an article about the man and his <UNK> odd book in a urllink back issue of <#> of my favorite magazines .
"the <UNK> 's crowd ai n't all bad , <UNK> ..."
"i know that the book holy blood , holy <UNK> is a castle of <UNK> built on the shifting <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> ."
"still , <UNK> 's <UNK> might not exist in the form that it does without holy blood , holy <UNK> being published ."
there are still a lot of pieces in it that i want <UNK> into a new narrative .
"<#> is <UNK> 's "" les <UNK> <UNK> "" ."
<UNK> of <UNK> - le - <UNK> bought a <UNK> of this painting among a few others .
it 's the <UNK> of et in <UNK> ego that 's the important part .
nevermind the <UNK> that the painting has <UNK> - le - <UNK> in the <UNK> background or that the <UNK> actually existed .
i truly do like the idea of the <UNK> though .
"bill , is the <UNK> of et in <UNK> ego , the much cooler i <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> actually proper latin for , "" <UNK> !"
"i <UNK> the secrets of god "" or is it so much more <UNK> , pleasing bullshit ?"
i refuse to read urllink the rule of <#> any more than i have .
"it 's not the <UNK> that i object to , but how <UNK> it 's <UNK> ."
the book that the rule of <#> authors hang their story around is urllink <UNK> <UNK> .
i have n't been able to wrap my mind around it yet as it 's <UNK> as hell .
i do n't even know if it deserves to be <UNK> from the <UNK> of the half - <UNK> efforts of those ivy league boys .
it 's hard to embrace a book that keeps being <UNK> as having a nearly sexual obsession with architecture .
i have this <UNK> urgent desire to instantly know what other people think about me .
"normal enough , until it becomes an obsession that demands action ."
i find myself saying things in a certain way to influence the opinions of others .
it 's another defense mechanism that i 've developed since my ex and i broke up .
i found an old journal of mine kept when i was <#> .
"i can vaguely remember thinking that all that made me "" well - rounded "" ."
"the journal , an <UNK> green <UNK> with wide - ruled sheets , contains thoughts i had forgotten . "" which me will i choose ?"
""" i cry <UNK> over and over again ."
"i 'd like to think there was a conscious choice , a turning point where i decided to fix up and look sharp ."
"i was an asshole a few years ago , and i knew it ."
"so i quit with the drugs , quit with the <UNK> , and just became .... and <UNK> lies the problem ."
i let an emotionally <UNK> little girl nearly ruin me .
now i 'm on the <UNK> of going out into the world and living an adult life .
<UNK> urllink death and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> youth ( thanks brett ) .
"so my boy billy sends me this invitation to post along with him here , and i instantly jumped at the opportunity ."
"i 've never had such an outlet for my ego , and i must admit it is intriguing ."
i 'm not really sure what the purpose of this is .
"therefore i will use this outlet to give opinions on all things <UNK> , music , movies , etc ."
"i do n't really know the <UNK> brett , but i do know a couple things about him ."
"i 'm neither as well read or <UNK> as bill , and i will probably never back anything with any sort of fact whatsoever ."
"fortunately , i 'm going to do my best to make no comments on any sort of issues of import ."
"my life <UNK> around spider - man , baked goods and animal face - off ."
"all i can think of to comment on today is <UNK> , which i finally broke down and saw ."
the only thing i came away from this picture with is that green lou <UNK> was much <UNK> and more interesting .
considering the money that goes into these movies i am very sad now .
"i 've had more own blog for ages , but over the months , it 's <UNK> its purpose to music alone ... rock - pop at that ."
"in messing about with the origin of the <UNK> , <#> author proposed that the invention of the original <UNK> is akin to a <UNK> - <UNK> movement ."
"since the only exposure i 've had to that word recently has been through <UNK> comic <UNK> , i had to look that up ."
now i find that the <UNK> were the <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> .
"<#> <UNK> , guy <UNK> , published a book covered with <UNK> , so that it would damage whatever it was placed against ."
human history is too vast and too detailed ever to be <UNK> by a single human mind .
is that why we constantly steal and <UNK> ideas ?
"i do believe in <UNK> and creation , but i do wonder exactly how much we have lost and <UNK> through the years ."
"i do n't quite know what to do with myself , not even how to struggle with how much i do n't know and how to accept that ."
"i have blessed an eager young mind with michael <UNK> , <UNK> ."
the truth is that i 'll always remember <UNK> <UNK> .
i have decided to start using this space to review books .
i 've read quite a few good books in the past few months and would like to share my impressions of them .
be on the look out ! as i become more <UNK>
"why does the <UNK> feature consider the word "" blog "" an error ?"
"( though this time , let 's include the u.s ."
media and the <UNK> presidency in this . )
"from his mouth to god 's ears , as my <UNK> grandmother used to say ."
what made me laugh so much while watching the daily show this wednesday was how accurately they portrayed the complete lack of <UNK> of organizations like fox and <UNK> .
"to recap , <#> of the best speeches of the convention was given by <UNK> ."
"now , many years ago when he used to lead <UNK> with <UNK> jews in new york , i did not have much liking or respect for him ."
he 's progressed quite far from that point .
"democracy is the worst form of government , except for those that have already been tried ."
my only problem with this notion is that what we have in the united states hardly can be called a democracy .
"we have a pseudo - democracy run by <UNK> and <UNK> , and money is the only true way to vote ."
"in a pseudo - democracy , <UNK> are a requirement ."
so now the idiot has a new <UNK> speech ( which he still ca n't deliver with his fourth - grade reading abilities :
has anyone actually looked at who is better off ?
and how much the middle class and the poor have lost ?
"bubba asked the right question in his convention speech : "" are you , average republicans , better off than you were in <#> ? """
"i believe he should have followed it by the question that even the romans understood : "" <UNK> <UNK> ? """
"( if you are not familiar with david <UNK> 's plays , this may not make much sense . )"
"so here i am , trying to learn my debut part , richard <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> ross ."
i 've written about that in <#> of the previous postings .
"off the bat , i have to say , i do n't like the play , and i certainly do n't like the character ."
but that does n't mean i can not play him .
"in the past , i 've rejected entire bodies of work based on a single bad experience ( ask me sometime what i think of <UNK> ) ."
richard <UNK> represents all that i hated about the <UNK> <UNK> .
", it 's the brand of evil with which i am almost comfortable , precisely because of its <UNK> ."
"so , in a sense it 's a <UNK> for me : it is good work , and i hate it ."
maybe the fact that <UNK> was able to <UNK> such a strong <UNK> from me is what makes him such a great writer .
"i had lived under the <UNK> that i "" must "" ( yeah , another distorted thought there ) like anything that 's a good work of art ."
maybe all it takes is to be able to <UNK> a strong response from the audience ...
"so , does that mean i am going to have to admit that mark <UNK> is an artist ? ! ?"
"a couple of weeks ago , my friend david opened a gallery ."
this was a <UNK> of a dream for him that he 's <UNK> for many years .
the week before the opening was quite stressful for all involved .
"suffice it to say , a lot of people worked their <UNK> off ."
"i was tired , and my normal social <UNK> of being in a large space with lots of people i do n't personally know were kicking into high gear ."
"i matched it with a very <UNK> gap t - shirt , custom - colored <UNK> sandals , and was trying to decide on <UNK> ."
"yes , i tend to wear <UNK> often ."
during the week i tried to express my feelings about gary <UNK> 's work .
i happen to find it soul - <UNK> .
"you can see some of it on the site above , or in the gallery itself ."
"gary <UNK> long events in a single frame of film , and the results are <UNK> ."
"so , armed with all the clothing and <UNK> i dared to wear to a casual opening , i came to the gallery ."
"i was <#> of the first there , of course , just so i could be around and give david and the other artists moral support ."
"gary was already there with a man who looked <UNK> like him , who turned out to be his brother , also a lovely man ."
"i <UNK> about the work , and explained what i saw in it that moved me so much ."
i then proceeded to look at the other works .
"i saw them as <UNK> moments in time , and admired them for a while ."
"once i was done with that , i started playing my usual part , that of an <UNK> ."
"i tend to be shy in large <UNK> ( see some of the previous articles ) , and am <UNK> uncomfortable in approaching people whom i do n't know ."
i wo n't go into her story ( she deserves an article all her own ) .
"the experience was turning out to be positive so far , when gary approached me and said he had something for me ."
"i had tears in my eyes , and a lump in my throat ."
he felt presenting me with his work was something he wanted to do .
"but the warm feelings i already felt toward him , and my pleasure in being at the opening were <UNK> and <UNK> by this <UNK> act of <UNK> ."
"we made a deal : he will stick around for a long time making his works , and i will stick around for a long time to admire it ."
i can not wait to see what he produces next .
"for those who know me well , that 's progress ."
i still remember an incident that happened <#> years ago .
the <UNK> clubs at the time were rage and studio <#> .
"so , i said "" hi , how are you ? """
"he turned slowly and <UNK> in my direction , and looked down ( he was about <UNK> "" to my barely <UNK> "" ) ."
"when i managed to open the car door , i was <UNK> , though silently ."
i did n't even feel the right to cry out loud .
i was a bug that was to be <UNK> by those i found attractive .
i had no right to even approach a man i found attractive .
that was the last time i ever approached a man in a gay establishment .
"seventeen years later , i am still terrified of rejection ."
"i have yet to approach anyone in a social situation where i am not the center , or close to the center , of attention ."
"i will either find people who will respond kindly , or i will prove her wrong ."
"so , slowly , i 've been starting small conversations , mostly in <UNK> , and so far , the experiences have been completely positive ."
i felt i could say something to her .
""" excuse me , but i have to tell you , that purse and that outfit look fantastic together . """
""" it 's just happened that way . "" "" nevertheless , i just wanted to tell you that you look beautiful . """
"the elevator door opened , and as she walked out , she gave me a <UNK> smile and said , "" i like you !"
i just wish i could have as much courage talking to a gay man as i have to a straight woman .
"i am taking several classes , but in this case , i am talking about the <#> that <UNK> acting and directing skills on a film set ."
"each student in the class must act in <#> scene , and co - direct another ."
"for those who saw the movie , this was the role played by al <UNK> ."
"i have no acting experience , but i am looking forward to the challenge , and thinking of my personal touches to add to the performance ."
it 's amazing what <UNK> do n't know about the process of directing .
"i am taking the class to learn ( among others , i might add ) ."
but what i could not have imagined is how much <#> <UNK> when <#> is directing .
"this is n't just due to the lights , or the constant moving around making sure that everyone 's questions on the set are answered ."
some of it is sweating ( literally ) over the choices you make .
"the <#> and a half hours went by like a blur , and i made my learning mistakes ."
"it was still somewhat embarrassing , even though only the instructor knew that the choices could have been different ."
"it did n't hurt that he was a very nice man , who tried his best to make me comfortable helping him <UNK> a vision ."
"so ... a new career , perhaps ?"
<#> of my <UNK> once said to me that i was abused on every job i 've ever worked ( see the <UNK> about the demise of <UNK> ) .
i am going to chalk up this experience as my first completed job that was directly supportive .
maybe that 's the key in finding the next thing to do : a truly supportive environment .
anyone know of companies like that where i could earn a living ?
i 've been questioning the notion that i am an artist .
"i 'd like to be <#> , but i am not sure what would make me an artist in my own mind ."
"when i went on a trip this <UNK> , i managed to take a number of photos ."
"some of them did not survive a technical difficulty , and some of them are n't up to my standards to share ."
"but i turned <#> set into an <UNK> book , and then published it on urllink my <UNK> page ."
some of the items have been thoroughly <UNK> ( i felt i had the right to do so to achieve certain effects ) .
"<#> image in particular ( and i doubt anyone can guess which <#> it is ) was <UNK> , and presented exactly as i took it ."
"beauty affects me deeply , but what i see as beauty may not be what you see as beautiful or even interesting ."
more important to me is what do you feel ?
i would be curious to hear from those who are not simply neutral about it .
"i am more interested in people 's view of the concepts and images , not the structure of the page ."
"when i am rich , david will design <#> of his truly <UNK> <UNK> for me to show off my work the way he has done for other artists ."
maybe then i will be ready to call myself that .
"i suspect i will do several posts on this subject , since it 's been coming up in therapy ."
"for those <UNK> with the concept , let me <UNK> what many <UNK> call the "" <#> distorted thinking patterns "" : <#> . all or nothing thinking"
": you look at things in absolute , black - and - white categories ."
<UNK> : you view a negative event as a never - ending pattern of defeat .
mental filter : you dwell on <UNK> and ignore the <UNK> .
<#> . <UNK> the <UNK> : you insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities do n't count .
: you conclude things are bad without any <UNK> evidence .
( a ) mind reading : you assume people are <UNK> <UNK> to you .
you predict that things will turn out badly .
<#> . <UNK> or <UNK> : you blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance .
"you reason from how you feel : "" i feel like an idiot , so i must be <#> . """
"<UNK> : instead of saying "" i made a mistake , "" you tell yourself "" i 'm a jerk , "" or "" a loser . """
"so , dealing with several situations today , i 've been watching for my own distorted thinking patterns ."
"for example , i had to meet with <#> people from a class to discuss a couple of scenes in which we are involved ."
"it 's a directing and acting class , so everyone gets to act in <#> scene , and direct another ."
"so , while avoiding "" <UNK> , "" i was <UNK> him to the max ! "" what an asshole ! """
""" what a <UNK> ! "" i also managed to <UNK> this , and fortune - tell at the same time : "" this is horrible !"
"well , that was also some more fortune - telling , <UNK> , <UNK> , and blame ."
"imagine , all those distorted thinking patterns in only <#> words !"
i guess i am going for the record ...
"so if <#> short ( <#> minute ) event can generate that many distorted thoughts , i wonder , how many of those do i have per day ?"
"and i <UNK> , "" my entire thinking is distorted ! "" , making sure that it 's all in black - and - white terms ."
no wonder therapy costs so much ! trying to change these thinking patterns seems to be a <UNK> task .
"but i am thinking that the idiot that i am , i must succeed , or the world will fall apart ! there !"
"as many of you know , politics is a bit of a hobby - horse for me ."
"mind you , it 's not that i thought al gore would have been a good president : he <UNK> the jimmy carter disease ."
"besides , <UNK> gore as first lady ? !"
"i mean , did n't we suffer enough with nancy reagan ?"
"so , we got what we did n't deserve ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> , hoping and praying that someone like <UNK> will either die or retire , shoved dubya into the white house ."
i thought the <UNK> was a good indication of how this presidency was going to go .
"i wished i could have been there with the crowd , throwing rotten eggs at that <UNK> ."
"of course , some <UNK> republican , like <#> of my mother 's closest friends , might ask , what do i have against the republicans ?"
"and you know , the answer is , not much , until we get to the neo - republicans ."
so i looked to the democrats ( and do n't tell me about third parties !
my radio is tuned almost exclusively to npr ( except when <UNK> <UNK> comes on ; for some reason i just can not endure him ) .
"i believe that if a government is n't going to be <UNK> in nature , it had better provide some decent social services ."
i believe there ought to be a test you have to take to vote .
"i mean , think of it : any bubba ( note , "" bubba "" in lower case ; i loved bubba the president ! )"
"well , that 's not the only way ."
"roger <UNK> ( sp ? ) and karl <UNK> , to me , are the definition of evil ."
"these are n't <UNK> men who believe strongly in their positions , and then fight for them ."
"they mug ordinary people , hitting them over the head with the club of push - polls , lies , and propaganda ( and"
i * know * propaganda : i lived in the soviet union long enough to be sick of it for the rest of my life ! ) .
", political <UNK> drive the <UNK> of a "" neutral "" committee ."
the other thing that <UNK> me is that democrats are n't even fighting the notion that that moron is a war - time president .
he <UNK> to compare himself with <UNK> ! ...
"he created this war , and in his words , it was because saddam tried to kill his daddy !"
and that makes him a war - time president ?
"i am sure that by the end of his term , reagan forgot it ."
"if you do n't learn from history , it 's going to come back and drop on you like a ton of <UNK> ."
i just want to be there when the <UNK> ton of <UNK> falls on the neo - conservative leadership .
"i 've been asked several times why i went to work for <UNK> , and then it did n't last ."
"the simple answer was , i needed the money , and they were the only ones who were offering ."
"i was convinced at the time that i needed a job as fast as possible , and the fact that there were alarm bells going off be damned ."
"by the way , if you are keeping score , this was another <#> of david 's <UNK> ."
"he told me to think not about the money , but about being happy ."
i did n't understand ( or was unwilling to listen and understand ) then .
the first note of alarm was in the interview process .
"debbie dean barely asked any <UNK> questions , and i thought that was that ."
"with <#> <UNK> , that was the point to say "" uh - uh !"
""" but as you , dear reader know , i do n't see <#> in any direction ..."
<UNK> ( for those who know who he is ) pointed that out to me in a session .
"he said that i was abused at every single job i 'd had before <UNK> , and he was right in all senses of the word ."
"so the offer came , i accepted it , and flew to dallas for the company meeting ."
"at first i was <UNK> surprised that the ceo was a <UNK> , and not a down - the - nose <UNK> a la <UNK> and company ."
i was told to figure out strategies for how the company could enter into the financial markets .
"to me , coming from <UNK> , that meant the global financial fortune <#> ."
"i mean , if you 're in there ( even in a couple of those ! ) , the rest fall like <UNK> , do n't they ?"
"they just wanted to sell to third <UNK> , preferably through <UNK> - sales !"
"( my <UNK> , <UNK> to large financial companies ? ! ? ! ?"
! ) almost immediately the pressure to start a direct mail campaign to attract <UNK> <UNK> me .
"i mean , could you imagine someone like the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> opening a direct mail envelope and calling ?"
"to be perfectly honest , mark did have some suggestions : <UNK> the campaign , make it exclusive , make it from me ..."
then i looked into the <UNK> software offering .
i could n't understand why anyone who is not a <UNK> in the market would buy it !
"i mean , this company is pushing generation <#> of stuff that everyone else is selling at generation <#> !"
what was the unique and compelling <UNK> that i could make to <UNK> or credit <UNK> ?
"it was a disaster , and only cory seemed to understand ."
i was so thrilled when mark told me cory will be closely involved .
"and he listened , and he took my complaints about the software seriously ."
for that i will always respect the man .
eventually the system x release was close enough on the horizon that i could begin taking it out into the world .
"i even got myself some <UNK> <UNK> ( well , save <#> , and i lay that turkey <UNK> at ron <UNK> 's feet ) ."
the last straw was the marketing budget and the phone call with <UNK> .
i offered a marketing budget of $ <UNK> to bring in between $ <UNK> and $ <UNK> of revenue over <#> months .
then the <UNK> call with <UNK> on the monday before thanksgiving <#> <UNK> it for me .
"the stream of <UNK> that came out of her mouth directed at me felt like that pig shit <UNK> al <UNK> described in "" lies ... "" ."
"if they did n't lay me off with the other <UNK> people <UNK> was kicking off the <UNK> , i was going to quit ."
"thankfully , the next morning , mark called and <UNK> offered a few <UNK> , suggesting that things did n't work out ."
"so i did <UNK> blame , and seemed to feel better for it ."
"that chapter was closed , and with the exception of lisa , phil , michael , kim , and <UNK> , i wanted to forget that place existed ."
the <UNK> came when an article about <UNK> appeared in the wall street journal .
"it was the first indication that the <UNK> was up for <UNK> and gary , and"
my only regret is that ron <UNK> and dave <UNK> were n't included in the <UNK> and the investigation .
"there was nothing to investigate about debbie : she is just petty , <UNK> , and out of her depth ."
"the <UNK> part of me hopes that when <UNK> and gary go to jail , they are joined at least by ron ."
i could n't hope that the <UNK> could get dave .
"after all , anyone with <UNK> experience knows how to cover up after himself ."
sometimes leaving <UNK> at the door is a really good idea .
"i mean , who 's ever heard of such a thing , right ?"
"well , after thinking about it for a while , i realized what she was trying to accomplish : she is teaching us to think <UNK> ."
", i think most of us do n't think <UNK> ."
"i 'll let you know on september <#> , after the chef <UNK> will be shown to the audience the night before ."
i might have to tell her she was right !
"i remember rolling around and laughing so hard that my sides <UNK> , my cheeks <UNK> , and i still laughed ."
"betty came out on stage in act <#> in a long black dress and said , "" i 'm gonna tell some jokes now . """
"yes , i am going to name names in these entries ."
( and i bet you wondered if i was even going to go there ! )
"then , david did figure it out ."
he 's been saying it for years . which brings us to david and his <UNK> capabilities .
i ca n't wait what he will predict next !
"which is so ironic , since as i type this , i am listening "" ( i can ) stand up for myself "" by army of lovers !"
"life is like that at times , is n't it ?"
"so for those who are worrying , yes , i still have the <UNK> , but i am learning to live with them ."
"just like i am learning to live with feelings ( besides anger , that is ! ) ."
"so , with lots of reservations , and lots of worries , here i am creating a blog ."
"and if anyone is wondering why i did it , well , i was inspired by urllink charles and his blog ."
"he likes writing , and is good at it , and i 'd like to be that way ."
so i am going to talk about everything from what <UNK> me at the moment to past experiences .
( on a lighter note this time ... ) i 've been fortunate to associate over the last few weeks with <#> puppies .
<#> is a <#> - <#> month old <UNK> that my <UNK> of the house where i live just got for their <#> - year old son .
"for those who know me , you know how much i love dogs ."
"puppies melt my heart immediately , <UNK> when they are friendly , and lick me , and these <#> tend to do that whenever they see me ."
"since then , we 've been "" kissing cousins . """
"he always runs up to me , lets me scratch him , and <UNK> me wherever he can reach ."
i usually get down as low as i can so he can lick my face .
"i mean , hey , if i do n't have a man doing it , i might as well get the love from the puppy , right ?"
: this was another example of dylan 's naming ) .
"yesterday things changed slightly . as she saw <UNK> rolling toward me ( he 's still having trouble walking <UNK> , which is <UNK> in itself )"
", she tried to run <UNK> , and push him away ."
<UNK> is someone i only get to see during class .
"last night during class , even the instructor was playing with him while <UNK> ."
"since i was <UNK> down to scratch him , i thought i 'd make both of us comfortable ."
i am wearing these little <UNK> with metal balls .
then he decided that the <UNK> and the ear <UNK> just were n't enough .
"i guess they can recognize that i love them , and they 've always treated me well ."
"i think when i get <UNK> well to go looking for work , and still have free time on my hands , i might consider <UNK> a dog again ."
"at times , when i was feeling particularly sad or depressed , he would sense it , and spend as much time with me as he could ."
soo maybe instead of a boyfriend i should settle for a dog .
this subject has come up between david and me at least a few times per week .
"i have watched him struggle with the fact that people promise to do something , or make plans , and then <UNK> ."
the instructor made several appointments with students so she could help them in their work to create that first short film .
"<#> of the guys i sent a message to responded almost immediately , and we even ended up <UNK> "" real "" e - mail addresses ."
"i 'll see what comes of it , he seems like someone with whom it would be a pleasure to hang out ."
"this particular instructor has a way of communicating that not everyone <UNK> , but i like her , and i dare say she seems to like me ."
"i was sad on her behalf : there she is , trying to help people , and they do n't have the courtesy to follow through ."
"has n't been easy to reach , nor has she done , to the best of my <UNK> , what she offered to do ."
"today ( wednesday ) , after i wake up and see my doctor ( someone else that is n't very good at following through )"
", i will call her and give her <#> last chance . if i can not reach her"
the whole notion of commitment has been a <UNK> experience for me .
for many years i was convinced that there was no <#> on whom i could rely .
but i still wonder how people continue to do this .
"i do n't ask "" why , "" since the "" why "" is n't important ."
"i keep asking myself what am i doing wrong in making <UNK> , following through , and not receiving it in return ."
i 've begun to believe that it 's a <UNK> shift in some ways : too many people have told me of similar experiences .
"once more i want the world to be logical , and get disappointed ."
"to quote the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , "" what is enough ? """
"you , gentle reader , might wonder why the third is a strike ."
"i mean , it would n't make sense looking for a man if i was n't gay , but the context of most gay <UNK> makes it so ."
i do n't find either of those to be big <UNK> when it comes to meeting someone with whom i am compatible .
the first <#> strikes have to do with the gay community <UNK> .
"i 've had a couple of experiences meeting that type of person , and all it did was make me even more self - conscious about my body ."
"as for intelligence , unless it 's focused on bon <UNK> and bitchy remarks , in my experience it does n't seem to be a plus for guys ."
"it may be coupled with the fact that when i am nervous , or want to be liked , i babble ."
"you may think , "" oh , but that 's not such a big deal ! """
the continued longing and desire for outside positive <UNK> has a great deal to do with it . but
lack of social skills when faced with a stranger ( i do n't have a problem with non - strangers ) puts me onto automatic pilot .
"that may not say anything to most of you , but i can not think of another literary example that fits the situation ."
"so , like mark <UNK> , i want to be liked ."
"like mark <UNK> , i do n't have much of any self - confidence that a man will like me . and"
"like mark <UNK> , i crave approval from outside , not having yet created "" the new house "" where the approval can come from within ."
"is it any wonder that i want a man , but ca n't seem to find <#> ?"
"being up in the dead of night , <#> is faced with the question of what to do ..."
"so i update software , i log onto several messenger services , i watch bits of movies that might be in my dvd drive ."
"i felt lucky when i was sleeping all the way through the night for a couple of months , but there was a negative side - effect : nightmares ."
"<UNK> ! ) , and a significant amount of self - <UNK> , as dreams sometimes do ."
"yes , i know it was a book first , but the movie made the phrase popular , did n't it ? )"
"so another way to spend the time is to work on the blog , and to work on whatever school has in store for me ."
"david is a brilliant writer , though he often <UNK> at that idea , and when we can get through our mutual <UNK> , we <UNK> very well ."
something else i just noticed is that time has a very strange flow at night .
only ten - <#> minutes ago i went downstairs for a glass of water
"when i went for another glass ten minutes later , the clock was showing <UNK> ."
"no , there is nothing wrong with the <UNK> on either the stove or the microwave , it 's my sense of time at night ."
"it seems <UNK> <UNK> , and i bet in another <#> - <#> minutes it 'll be <#> am and light outside ."
"i 've been encouraging my therapist to read them , and she keeps telling me she will , <#> day ."
"i bet you , however , it wo n't be in the <#> minutes between <UNK> and <UNK> ."
david and i often have conversations about the notion of free <UNK> .
"in most of these situations , whoever is receiving this free <UNK> is happy to get it ."
"i dare you to try to ask <#> he ca n't answer . """
"and it was very nice to feel positive <UNK> not only from david , but from those few who 'd tried to <UNK> me ."
"i often tell people , "" ask david about [ insert <UNK> , emotional , or personal situation ] . """
"so , yes , it 's nice , in the immortal words of the church lady to feel a little bit superior ."
"besides , people often feel that if they have n't paid for something , it ca n't be that good"
"( the "" you get what you pay for "" mentality ) ."
and yet i continue to get myself into these situations where i end up giving free <UNK> and getting nothing for it .
"that 's where i 'd like it to come from , and not from individuals who may or may not care to give it ."
the group leader pointed out that this notion is the basis of all therapy .
i wonder if i will ever get there .
"in essence , i wonder if i will ever stop craving approval from strangers ."
approval from people who know me just does n't give the same <UNK> boost . and
"is n't that a kick in the rubber parts , as <UNK> <UNK> used to say ?"
in <#> of my earlier musings i mentioned that i dressed to the <UNK> .
the story of my clothing education is long and covered in patches .
"i learned as i went along , and sometimes made not - so - clever choices ."
"i still remember , when i was <#> or <#> , getting my parents to buy me a black silk shirt ."
"what i had n't realized at the time was that it only looked good on you with a while suit and tie , and if you were john <UNK> ."
"i 've since forgotten what it was , and since levi 's never fit me very well , it does n't matter ."
my initial choices in suits were n't bad .
"i looked damned good in it , too !"
"when i moved to la , and discovered trendy fashion , i spent a lot of money trying to buy into it ."
"while working for companies that did not require me to dress up , i did n't really care , but then came the <UNK> days ."
"i had just opened an account at needless mark - up ( <UNK> marcus to everyone else ) , and struck a <UNK> relationship with a sales guy there ."
"needless to say , my <UNK> pursuit of him did n't get me very far , but he did introduce me to <UNK> ."
"when it comes to clothes off the rack , <UNK> is probably the world 's best in making men 's suits , and in <UNK> , men 's ties ."
"as i started spending time in london , i learned about other design houses , and for a while was <#> of <UNK> 's big customers ."
"i even had <UNK> , and later <UNK> , do made - to - measure clothes for me . but"
"even the made - to - measure stuff , after multiple <UNK> and re - <UNK> just did not look right ."
a very well - known <UNK> of fine men 's clothing <UNK> declined to help : they only <UNK> suits bought from them .
"so , in my despair , i looked elsewhere ."
"around the corner from the <UNK> sydney office was a little shop with a <UNK> logo , called john <UNK> ."
"i walked in there <#> day and asked , somewhat <UNK> , if they could do something about making my suits fit better ."
"john , and his then - partner karl agreed to take a stab at it , <UNK> warning me that they could n't perform miracles ."
"the result was my first <UNK> suit , a black flat wool single button suit ."
"suffice it to say , when i wore it to the office for the first time , everyone commented ."
"over a period of <#> years , i threw away all my designer suits , and all my designer shirts ."
and then we started exploring . early in <#>
"i came with it to john and karl , and the result was the first of the wild suits they created for me ."
"it even had the little <UNK> hook on the back , but it was far beyond the <UNK> design ."
", it helped me look <UNK> ( through some tricks in the fabric ) , and i absolutely loved it ."
"if you are interested in what it looks like , the picture in my profile features me in that suit ."
"we created suits that were interesting , and we began to experiment ."
"i decided i wanted a <UNK> jacket i could wear for flights , but i wanted an extra touch ."
so john suggested that we use <UNK> silver buttons <UNK> with my <UNK> .
"i thought that'd be too <UNK> ( coming from me , think about it ! ) , and instead designed a logo ."
"also around this time , we were discussing how they were <UNK> my suits on the inside . <UNK> clothing"
"usually comes with the label of the customer 's name , and the date the <UNK> was <UNK> ."
"for the first few suits , john would put """
"after <#> days of careful consideration , i had it ."
"from that point on , my clothes were <UNK> "" leo <UNK> , <UNK> . """
"the foundation had to have a name , and it became the <UNK> foundation ."
"in my will , if it 's not formed , and if any <UNK> are left , the bulk of the <UNK> will go into forming the foundation ."
"so , queen for life became both the name of the foundation , and the <UNK> on the labels of my clothing made by john ."
i feel very special every time i wear them .
"otherwise , it 's the <UNK> , or the ones ( my standard t - shirt and jeans look i 've adopted this century ) ."
"i have yet to find someone who was <UNK> by at least a few of the suits , and certainly by the ties and the <UNK> ."
this clothing used to be my protective shell .
"and when i wore <#> of the <UNK> suits when i was playing richard <UNK> , it seemed to <UNK> me with the power"
i feel whenever i wear john 's beautiful <UNK> .
"i feel i can accomplish anything , <UNK> to anyone , sell anything when i am dressed in these suits ."
"<UNK> , when i am in my jeans and t - shirt , i feel exposed ."
the suit of armor is a very real thing for me .
"it 's not made of metal , but it gives me the same feeling it must have given the <UNK> knights in their suit of armor ."
except i feel i can move as freely in my armor as <UNK> <UNK> did in a knight 's tale .
"now , if only i looked like <UNK> <UNK> in a knight 's tale ... maybe i would n't need the armor of the suit anymore to feel protected ."
"mind you , i do n't necessarily class all republicans in that bucket ."
"for example , john <UNK> 's statement <UNK> the tv ad attacking kerry 's vietnam record was <UNK> to say the least ."
"it 's too bad that he did n't take the further step , like another of his colleagues from <UNK> , and left the party altogether ."
"yes , i call that <UNK> all kinds of nasty names ."
"it all sounds angry , and it certainly is ."
for many years i was convinced that the only emotion i could experience was anger .
"now , having gone through therapy with <UNK> , and working with caroline , i am getting closer and closer to discovering who and what i am ."
"i felt i was not allowed to feel anything else for most of my life , so i kept the anger inside until it <UNK> over ."
"the <UNK> <UNK> would take more than <#> article to describe , and i might even write a few articles about some of"
"bottom line is , this blog is my way of expressing my anger and other emotions and not letting them <UNK> ."
"i take her suggestion not as a criticism , but as an expression of that love ."
"on the other hand , i know what it 's like to live with anger <UNK> inside me ."
"besides , i suspect that the only people who read the blog regularly are my mother and charles ."
when my dear friend greg gave me a diary - like book
"so i would start writing , whatever it is i may write"
"anyone who has seen my <UNK> when i write quickly knows how <UNK> it can be , and besides , for many years writing long - hand seemed <UNK> ."
"i did it for a while when i was working with <UNK> , but eventually stopped , because it felt uncomfortable ."
"on the other hand , i can type a lot faster than i write ."
"so when i write about yet another <UNK> committed by that <UNK> known as the <UNK> presidential administration , i use specific language ."
"i will be forever grateful to him for the chapter on pig shit <UNK> , among other things i learned from that book ."
"so , most likely , i will continue to use strong language and call the bastards what they are ."
", i 'd be using strong language as well ."
": if the people think , democrats always win ."
it 's time for the <UNK> to do it too .
"well , here we are again with another portion of <UNK> ."
are you able to prevent <UNK> parts of your <UNK> from <UNK> local children ?
is your belly taking a peek at the world from under your shirt .
my weight has yo - <UNK> so <UNK> in recent years that i only see my feet at <UNK> <UNK> like rugby world cups and visiting <UNK> .
is it socially acceptable to take up <#> seats with <#> arse on <UNK> flights ?
<UNK> not if i happen to be sitting in the second seat at the time .
it 's true that there are people out there who are <UNK> overweight and are doing absolutely nothing about it .
what you consider to be an acceptable level of health and fitness ( not to mention bulk ) maybe completely alien to someone else .
in many cases the individuals concerned are not happy with the way they look but there are a great many that are .
they may be <UNK> wonders but it 's their life to live as they choose .
more power to their arm i say - they 're gonna need it to <UNK> in a fourth helping of mississippi mud pie .
"currently , i am <UNK> on a new fitness programme of my own ."
it 's quite intense but only takes just a few minutes .
you may like to try it if you want to tone up a bit .
do as many push ups as you can in <#> minute .
<#> . do as many sit ups as you can in <#> minutes .
<#> . do as many <UNK> as you can in <#> minutes .
top this off with <#> minutes running or power walking and you have pocket - size fitness plan for today 's lazy <UNK> .
over time you can try and beat your <UNK> or increase the time limits for the individual tasks .
set a target for a months time and try and reach it but make it realistic .
"it would be <UNK> , to say the least , to fall flat on your nose <#> push ups short of your target ."
do n't make it too easy either or the whole exercise becomes pointless .
"personally , i have some <UNK> and <UNK> planned for this evening ."
but i did manage to get a date with the the girl at the <UNK> so <UNK> possible !
<UNK> 's challenge : re - <UNK> myself with my feet without the aid of a mirror .
i would n't mind but <UNK> have so freaked my mother that she 's been too afraid to leave her house on at least <#> occasions since last march .
this was most <UNK> for the developers who wanted to build a shopping centre on the site .
they thought it was some kind of sit - in protest .
it was a week before she came out of the bathroom and only then to hide in the <UNK> under the stairs .
she earned fame and <UNK> in the <#> 's by telling us who was going to win the national lottery but was then <UNK> <UNK> when they did n't .
"another stars star is russell grant , the human beach ball ."
"today he told me , along with <#> <#> other <UNK> , that i should n't avoid dealing with taxes , insurance and joint <UNK> ."
he went on to say that i 'd have some unpleasant situations imposed on me if i ignore these issues .
i do n't tell him how to run his business <UNK> so why should i listen to what he thinks of mine ?
we all have opinions but to <UNK> them on the whole population everyday is taking the <UNK> if you ask me .
and he 's had plenty of them that 's for sure !
the above reading was n't pleasant so i 've decided to <UNK> it .
if tomorrow he says that i will <UNK> the earth and a smashing little cottage in the lake district i 'll perhaps take that .
"if i do n't get my <UNK> however , i may have to take legal action ."
"you could leave this page right now if you wanted ... or not , and <UNK> along to the very end of the piece ."
you could decide to throw your pc against the wall which i 'd fully <UNK> - the writing today is just awful !
"<UNK> , you could go make a coffee or go and fly a <UNK> or fix that <UNK> roof <UNK> ."
these are all decisions you can make right now and you could change your mind a <#> times before you do any of them .
i guess what i 'm trying to say is is that life is about choices .
in any situation we can decide what we want to do .
we may be afraid of the immediate consequences but if we know in out heart that the decision is in our best interest we should just do it .
"take your chances guys , we can achieve absolutely anything if we put our minds to it ."
"i 'm sure , like me , you would n't want your dying words to be : ' if only ... ' <UNK> !"
<UNK> 's challenge : do n't die and fall in a <UNK> heap with regret .
"in this my first blog , i shall be talking to you about dreams ."
i can assure you right now that this will not be about the <UNK> stuff that crosses your mind when you first wake up in the morning .
"i ca n't see the connection myself but rather <UNK> , they 're absolutely spot on !"
it 's a <UNK> - brown substance and it looks like it might stain so i think i better go wash it off .
"seriously though , your dreams , life goals and desires are <UNK> important to your future ."
have you ever taken the time to map out the route for the life you want ?
it makes a lot of sense to write down your goals and sub - goals and set dates for when to complete them .
take some time now to <UNK> with yourself and write these out .
you might be surprised what 's lingering in your <UNK> .
this exercise will help you look into your future with a lot more clarity .
is there a totally different career out there for you ?
this will help you to focus on them and can be used as an incentive to keep you chasing the dream .
another technique is <UNK> - try to imagine now what your ideal life would be like .
"this can be very powerful and if you 're willing to believe it , anything is possible ."
"if we had a life users manual , i would expect the words ' life is subject to change ' to feature somewhere on the first page ."
"just as i got enough money together to pay off my credit card , i managed to park my car at <UNK> in my neighbours garden ."
"in so doing , i <UNK> down his scale model of a dutch <UNK> <UNK> at great expense from <UNK> ."
i still say that i was doing him a favour as it was a bloody <UNK> .
"however , i 've now had to pay to have his lawn <UNK> not to mention fund the replacement of his <UNK> <UNK> ."
"the point is that all this was an unexpected life event , particularly for my neighbour , who is only now speaking to me through his <UNK> ."
plans have to be <UNK> but not too flexible to the extent that nothing gets done .
you may have goals that include learning more about the world we live in and taking time out for yourself to <UNK> your batteries .
"it would be easy , therefore , to put your feet up in front of a tv showing a documentary about the history of public transport in <UNK> ."
"no , we need tangible goals where we can see the results and know that we are moving forward in the direction we want ."
"you could then invite friends over to stay , maybe even the girl from the <UNK> !"
"however , the goal in that instance would not be to invite her into the spare room but into your bedroom ."
"actually , that should be my goal something else for the ' to - do ' list !"
<UNK> 's challenge : improve relationships with people in the baked goods industry .
"last week i spoke about <UNK> and the benefits of standing and talking to yourself in front of a mirror , naked or otherwise ."
"well , today i 'm <UNK> on the otherwise and by that i mean clothes , appearance and <UNK> etc ."
are you happy with the image you 're presenting right now ?
is your personal <UNK> up to scratch or is your personal <UNK> causing you to scratch ?
"be honest now , do you need an industrial strength <UNK> to keep the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> at bay ?"
if the answer is yes you 're best off <UNK> me in advance before you call round so i can arrange to be away on business .
these chemical <UNK> are highly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in themselves .
they are no more <UNK> friendly than the <UNK> being <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> treatment plant located next door to us straight into my garden pond .
"the <UNK> were absolutely furious and the effect on their <UNK> has now put them <UNK> of the <UNK> descriptions act , <#> ."
"the sweaty stuff we call <UNK> , is part of your body 's <UNK> system and is <UNK> way of helping you to cool down ."
"it 's not the sweat itself that smells , it 's the <UNK> caused by <UNK> on your skin <UNK> rather unpleasant - smelling natural chemicals ."
"! why on earth did i choose this topic ... ) ' yes steven , i stink to high heaven ."
answer : take a shower more often than once a quarter !
"seriously , a good wash in all those <UNK> and <UNK> every day should keep the problem a bay ."
do they have more <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> 's face or are they more <UNK> than the pope ?
"however , if you look like you 've just crawled out of a spin - dryer you 're unlikely to win any fashion awards ."
"mind you , i bet they 're earning an absolute bloody fortune !"
if you can get your clothes cleaned and pressed each week you will feel so much better about yourself .
i let out a <UNK> of delight if i ever go to a drawer or <UNK> and find a ready to wear item of clothing .
"a good rule of thumb is to remember that a clean , good - fitting pair of jeans and a sweatshirt will always look better than a dirty suit ."
that <UNK> shirt was a mistake too and as for that tie well ...
"finally , it 's also important to dress right for the right occasion ."
your ' monsters of rock ' t - shirt is not appropriate for a job interview or a funeral even if it is black .
"likewise , do n't make the mistake of wearing full evening dress if you 're taking part in a swimming <UNK> especially if it 's hired ."
<UNK> 's challenge : do n't wear <UNK> 's when going to the opera .
"till next time , stay pong and <UNK> free !"
"<UNK> are free , easy and can be very effective . repeating a positive phrase in front of the mirror , in the car , or"
writing it down on paper <UNK> it into your mind .
the following are just a few techniques you can use - i will come back to some of the others at a later date .
"stand in front of the mirror and say positive things about , and to yourself like : ' i am intelligent ' and"
' there is nothing that i can not achieve ' etc .
a strange thing happened while i was using this <UNK> exercise .
this was rather <UNK> as the mirror was n't broken .
this is fine in your own home but you 're <UNK> to be arrested if you start talking to yourself in an <UNK> state in public .
it 's behavior that tends to be <UNK> upon by the vast majority of the population .
exercise for body and mind particularly useful for those people on a health kick .
repeat your <UNK> while exercising and they will become part of your thought process .
"<UNK> while repeating your <UNK> , actively think of ways to <UNK> it into your life ."
the x 's are intended as <UNK> but all they 're doing for me is make me think <UNK> thoughts about the girl at the <UNK> !
here are some <UNK> you may like to try : •
"[ that was my last burger , honest ] •"
[ at the <UNK> rate of <#> % <UNK> ] •
""" my eyes see clearly see the world around me . """
[ except when i have n't got my contacts in ] •
""" i am listening to spirit everyday . "" [ it says : ' drink me ! ' ] •"
""" i am a spark of divine love . """
[ you 've got to be joking ! ] •
] so there you have it - get naked and talk to your reflection .
"hmmm , which way is it to the <UNK> ?"
<UNK> 's challenge : get a new mirror or stop taking <UNK> drugs .
you ca n't help your ears being that big .
"as a fashion <UNK> , it 's about as cool as <UNK> swimming <UNK> and has done me absolutely no <UNK> at all with the girl from the <UNK> ."
i would n't mind but it was down to her that i 'm in this state in the first place !
"however , this situation has inspired the following piece on the benefits of having someone you can trust for support when you need them ."
we all have to face our demons from time to time .
"personally , i have been haunted on and off for the past <#> years now"
"but if my ex - mother - in - law would only stay at her home where she belongs , we 'd get on oh , so much better ."
she 's coming over this weekend to see my former spouse and i am expecting a little visit from her too .
i wish she would n't poke her nose in especially when it looks the way it does .
"what i have to accept is , is that she is now my wife 's <UNK> ."
you should have heard the <UNK> language - i wo n't bother helping next time .
the support that family and friends can give us has been <UNK> to be <UNK> powerful .
"sometimes , especially in affairs of the heart , a third party may help you see a situation in a whole new light ."
i hear that marriage guidance <UNK> and divorce lawyers have a lot of experience in this area too .
"to move forward , we should all try to exercise the devil in our lives ."
he could do with a <UNK> good walk not to mention an <UNK> of his personality .
"let 's face it , his people skills are non - <UNK> , and he 's so red in the face"
"whatever you feel able to <UNK> to a <UNK> , it is always good to talk ."
arrange a regular meeting with a tried and trusted friend so you can share your thoughts on issues affecting your respective lives together .
it 's a way of helping each other and will increase the bond between you .
"you must remember though that , unless agreed otherwise , the detail should remain between yourselves ."
"always remember that a problem shared is a problem <UNK> or in my mother - in - laws case , <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's challenge : try not to laugh at the <UNK> on ex - mother - in - laws nose .
"before i continue , i just have to say that nothing has appeared in my pants "" by accident "" since i was <#> ."
the urllink <UNK> report has very good news : osama found in sandy <UNK> ’s
while <UNK> on both sides of the aisle celebrated the discovery of mr .
"bin laden in the former white house <UNK> ’s <UNK> , this latest episode left mr ."
"<UNK> , once again , with much explaining to do ."
"” at the white house , president george w. bush ordered an immediate and <UNK> search of mr ."
"pants “ to see what else might be in there , ”"
<UNK> that the discovery of saddam hussein ’s long - sought weapons of mass destruction might be at hand .

"we can watch the politicians <UNK> for the high ground , and we can watch the fingers point anywhere and everywhere ."
because the reason <#> occurred goes far beyond <#> terrorists - both known and unknown - making their way onto commercial <UNK> with sharp instruments .
"an aside here , though : why was it ever okay for someone to board an airplane with no luggage save for a box <UNK> ?"
"have you ever , when you 're packing for a trip , said to yourself , "" <UNK> , <UNK> , clean underwear - ooo"
the cia and fbi were n't the only ones experiencing serious intelligence failures .
"<#> stands as the most <UNK> day in a long line of them - from the <UNK> bombing , to the cole , to our <UNK> in africa ."
"the hatred was there long ago and according to the report , ... in this sense , <#> has taught us that terrorism against american interests “ over there"
” should be <UNK> just as we regard terrorism against america “ over here .
"” in this same sense , the american homeland is the planet ."
"but the enemy is not just “ terrorism , ” some generic evil ."
the <UNK> threat at this moment in history is more specific .
"it is the threat posed by <UNK> terrorism <UNK> the al qaeda network , its <UNK> , and its ideology . as we mentioned in chapter <#> ,"
"that stream is motivated by religion and does not <UNK> politics from religion , thus <UNK> both ."
it is further fed by <UNK> stressed by bin <UNK> and widely felt throughout the muslim <UNK> the u.s .
"military presence in the middle east , policies perceived as anti - arab and anti - muslim , and support of israel ."
it is not a position with which americans can bargain or <UNK> .
with it there is no common <UNK> even respect for <UNK> which to begin a dialogue .
it can only be destroyed or utterly isolated .
( via urllink <UNK> ) destroyed or isolated .
"well , we 've seen that they refuse to be isolated , especially since our <UNK> or destruction is their goal ."
"so without <UNK> pre - <UNK> war , the report seems to <UNK> pre - <UNK> war ."
"this is the world we 're living in - the <#> we never hoped for , but the <#> we 're stuck with , nevertheless ."
"i imagine the many ways that statement "" destroyed or utterly isolated "" can be implemented ."
does it ever feel like there 's just too much going on in the world ?
"times like this , i just want to <UNK> down and contemplate nothing more earth - <UNK> than good <UNK> ."
"now that 's <UNK> , <UNK> - up happiness ."
i 'm addicted to slow - cooked pork <UNK> <UNK> in dave 's sweet and <UNK> sauce .
"it 's a crazy world , so it 's nice to find the yummy bits ."
"or as i call it , my occasional <UNK> of the urllink <UNK> website ."
"how many news sites have an entire <UNK> bar devoted to "" conspiracy theories "" ?"
i go because i want to read other people 's points of view .
i want to see which way the spin goes in other parts of the world .
"in australia , i hear it turns counter - <UNK> ."
"to jessica williams , the "" tragedy "" is that she may actually urllink go to jail for urllink killing <#> kids ."
"it 's my damn blog , after all ."
<#> of my favorite bloggers is urllink here .
"i had a post , really i did , but when i pushed "" publish "" i got an error message ."
i do n't even know where to start with # <#> .
that thing 's been a circus since the poor man was found dead .
"i 'm still laughing - not because of what happened , but because of how strange it is ."
"so i thought i 'd tested this already , but it would appear not . trying again . . ."
"urllink <#> texas children found in <UNK> <UNK> i 'm not a hate - filled person , really i 'm not ."

"the woman , whose name was not released , took all the [ foster ] children in october to <UNK> , where a relative of her fiance lived ."
the children were <UNK> in school and the mother returned to houston about <#> days later .
she went to work in iraq in april .
but the children were later removed from school because payment for their tuition stopped and lived in a wooden <UNK> .
<UNK> child - protection authorities found the children <UNK> and sick and moved them to an <UNK> in late july .
why could n't some of those <UNK> assholes have taken her ?
"okay , so i added the bit about her being taken out and shot ."
"there , <UNK> ill and weak , he said "" my <UNK> ends here . """
"so today , i read another story with a headline "" pope near end of his life . """
"his physical health may be <UNK> , but his will and his spirit are as strong now as ever ."
"i have n't always agreed with the <UNK> , but i can take a moment to appreciate the essential goodness of this man ."
"urllink bear <UNK> on <UNK> fruit at <UNK> i do n't know what 's funnier : the story , or the headline 's <UNK> spelling of ' <UNK> . '"
i also have to wonder - would a bear get a hangover ?
urllink abc news can take their breaking news e - mail service and stuff it .
"instead , i get this : the <UNK> in the kobe <UNK> case has asked for an <UNK> <UNK> to delay the trial ."
the only thing i need to round out my day is a scott <UNK> update . . . .
i 'm going straight to urllink bbc from now on .
"a warning from the fbi in detroit can be <UNK> to our local fbi , and <#> metro officers viewed the tape ."
"a warning was not given to the public , though this tape proved las vegas to be an al - qaeda target ."
"still , the mayor claims this information never got to his office at city hall ."
<UNK> said he would like to confront the <UNK> .
""" i 'd like to call him a liar , "" the mayor said ."
"if there were danger , you can bet i 'd be screaming it all over the media . """
"gee , oscar . in your own subtle way , you did just call the guy a liar ."
i think you 're <UNK> a wee bit too much .
"i would hope , as the number <#> public official in las vegas , you would <UNK> with others ."
"perhaps you 'd work with the fbi to decide whether the threat was general or <UNK> , try to discover the nature of the threat ( car bomb ?"
<UNK> small plane or <UNK> ? ) and make an appropriate warning after you had more to go on .
: i can understand that the nature of the threat is rarely clear .
just as i 've understood since september 12th that i live in a <UNK> city - the very nature of las vegas is an <UNK> to <UNK> - <UNK> .
"but if the words "" <UNK> tape "" were even whispered in my general direction , i 'd want to know more ."
"if something here really does "" go boom , "" regardless of the scale , our economy will be crushed ."
"if the tourists do n't think we 're safe , they wo n't come ."
"now comes the interesting part , and i 'd love to see research on this <#> ."
"as a <UNK> computer engineer / <UNK> that has spent too many years behind a desk , i found at <#> i was diagnosed with type <#> diabetes ."
it ’s a common enough illness that unfortunately is not treated with the respect it deserves .
"diabetes <UNK> to <UNK> , heart disease , strokes , kidney failure , <UNK> , and nerve damage ."
"diabetes kills over the course of months and years , not days and weeks ."
"personally , i took the <UNK> seriously ; it was a real wake up call ."
"i was <#> years old , an amazing <#> lbs over weight with <UNK> high <UNK> and <UNK> levels ."
"as my doctor put it , i was “ walking towards the light , a prime candidate for <UNK> disease ” ."
all i could do was shake my head and wonder how i had let this happen .
the day i was diagnosed was the day i started to make positive changes in my lifestyle .
i immediately stopped working <#> - <#> hour work weeks .
i started to watch what i put into my body and spend time at the gym .
"over the course time i began to see results , lowered blood sugar levels , more energy and better overall health ."
i was pleased with the progress i had made but still very disappointed in myself for allowing this to happen in the first place .
i was also having a really hard time losing weight and just didn’t feel as healthy as i thought i should given all of the work i was doing .
i felt and still feel that i <UNK> it to myself to makeup for the years of mediocre to downright poor health and physical neglect .
"we only live once after all , so why take the cheap seats ."
"first i did a little personal <UNK> , <UNK> my diet / exercise habits and talking with my doctor about it ."
<#> ) i had likely screwed up and slowed down my <UNK> by eating too few calories for too long ; making my body think that food was <UNK> .
"it was about this time that i started to loose my hair , mainly from pulling it out in frustration ."
as a kid i was exposed to an “ old school ”
"the people who ran the do <UNK> could hardly speak english , all of them korean and vietnam war veterans ."
i had been told that their system was a <UNK> of japanese karate and an ancient korean martial system ( or group of “ <UNK> ” )
i quickly found that what i was looking for was lost to a world of <UNK> .
the most obvious difference aside from the red and blue foot pads and head gear was the lack of <UNK> in how they trained .
the <UNK> i had met didn’t talk about work or chicks or the weather when they trained ; they just trained and trained hard .
i started to look at other martial systems and in most cases found the same thing .
after a couple of months i was getting a little discouraged .
"as a fat guy , it was sort of like looking for clothes at wal - mart , nothing fit right ."
then i stumbled upon the florida <UNK> <UNK> academy .
"amazingly enough , just a short drive away and the first conversation i had with the <UNK> was very low key ."
the school was attending a seminar and would not have time to spend with a new student until they got back .
from the first night as an <UNK> i knew i had found the right place .
"i quickly realized that <UNK> <UNK> didn’t hype his <UNK> style because he didn’t have to , these guys were intense , very intense and <UNK> spoke for itself ."
"it was all there , discipline , tradition , stunning technique ."
never look to this blog as a technical reference for <UNK> <UNK> or any other dynamic of an actual process involved in performing specific techniques .
i am very wrong as often as i am right when giving advice and if you have a <UNK> you should go to him for specific technical questions .
<UNK> or the website for the <UNK> that i attend at urllink <UNK> .
<UNK> nelson performed at the <#> democratic convention tonight without trigger !
"since may , <UNK> has been <UNK> urllink <UNK> tunnel syndrome and has been <UNK> doing shows post surgery ."
he recently performed at ray charles ' memorial ceremony sans guitar .
"i had seen a photo in urllink rolling stone doing "" georgia "" , but i had thought he was doing a <UNK> arrangement ."
this is a national crisis of a gravity somewhere between urllink missing <UNK> and austin powers ' missing <UNK> .
but <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> was <UNK> to have taken place in june .
he started <UNK> tour dates and had a big weekend for his annual july 4th picnic .
there have been a <UNK> of cancelled and <UNK> dates since and now his tour with dylan is <UNK> .
"obviously , if he can not perform <#> song at an appearance with trigger , then a full concert appearance is going to be tough ."
can we imagine an america without the <UNK> of <UNK> 's <UNK> - string <UNK> out in front of the family band ?
john kerry is building his speech to a <UNK> big finish .
"<UNK> 's "" beautiful day "" springs forth into the hall ."
kerry and edwards are trying to deliver the goods .
the <#> % <UNK> balloons are drifting down .
i remember the <#> gop convention ; an <UNK> of <UNK> resulted in a near <UNK> on tv .
i hope that it may be firmly resolved to have <UNK> at the <UNK> ball with trigger in hand doing whiskey river .
that is an american ideal as good as some and better than most .
"well , the band was <UNK> ; <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> ; the <UNK> were very <UNK> ."
"it took a while to get there , but at about <#> minutes until <UNK> the room took on that special glow ."
"the <#> year old <UNK> <UNK> a fine version of "" amazing grace "" ."
"there was a nice version of "" <UNK> ' in the wind "" with a sweet soul groove ."
the gop can not possibly top the music at this convention with their vegas show band on <UNK> and wayne newton and lee <UNK> .
they will have to dig deep and con some <UNK> from somewhere .
"oh god , what if they get p. <UNK> ?"
perhaps missing in action is the band itself .
it wo n't tell you where they hid the band or who the band is .
turns out the band is being led by steve jordan .
it was actually during <UNK> <UNK> 's sam <UNK> number that i got <UNK> curious as to who the drummer was and where they were hiding the band .
"after <UNK> around awhile , it turns out the drummer is the <UNK> ."
"danny "" <UNK> "" <UNK> is on guitar ."
"he is the co - writer of "" boys of summer "" and "" dirty laundry "" among other songs with don <UNK> ."
"i wish i knew the name of the fantastic <UNK> , but trying to find out anything regarding the band is a bit of a challenge ."
i can not even figure out where they have them set up .
maybe they are under the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> .
"yes , there is lots of love going on ."
"however , the <UNK> do n't need to be the party of the <UNK> bear hug ; we need to be the party of game over ."
"attempts to make <UNK> , fluffy rhetoric need to be balanced with swinging <UNK> that land right on the nose of conservative <UNK> ."
this is how you keep the energy flowing in a room until it starts to build and mean something .
"it does n't <UNK> policy or create legislation , but as bob <UNK> once said , "" you need to <UNK> up yourself "" ."
"dean had it , edwards has it whenever he is not <UNK> his life as a <UNK> <UNK> , obama 's getting it , kerry needs it ."
""" the <UNK> ... it is like back in <#> when "" disaster movies "" were <UNK> <UNK> , only this time it is pissed - off <UNK> ."
"for the 2nd time in a month , my wife and i attended a screening of a documentary in a packed theater ."
the last time we went for an evening of non - fiction cinema prior to this summer was for urllink <UNK> back in <#> .
"there appears to be a significant segment of the population ready to see films , buy books , and otherwise engage in <UNK> forms of <UNK> ."
"apparently , we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it anymore . but"
"<UNK> , there is another segment of the population that loves nothing more than to urllink slap liberals about the head and face until they fall down ."
"this summer is the summer of "" who 's side are you on ? "" , and perhaps like <#> it is turning into a possibly ugly <UNK> ."
"if a corporation is an urllink "" artificial human being "" , than what kind of human being is it ?"
the movie opens with the premise that corporate <UNK> may be <UNK> <UNK> to determine its overall mental state .
the <UNK> : corporations exhibit <UNK> <UNK> — run for your lives !
is this some sort of propaganda that <UNK> people to rise up and storm the gates of industry !
are we to <UNK> and <UNK> the tools of production for a just society ?
"afterwards , i asked laura if she thought the movie was propaganda . "" my idea of propaganda ..."
""" she noted , "" is not something that makes you think , it is something that gives you the impression that you do n't need to think . """
the movie makes a good case that <UNK> corporations ultimately seek loosely <UNK> ownership of virtually every aspect of the <UNK> .
the ugly night of <UNK> has <UNK> from the high - rise office towers and is <UNK> the streets — very dramatic .
i remember businesses closing early to allow workers a chance to get out of the loop before the <UNK> imposed the <UNK> .
it was an impressive show of force to protect a small band of conference <UNK> at the <UNK> .
"perhaps <UNK> , i contrast this with when the <UNK> abandoned whole <UNK> of south central la during the <UNK> king <UNK> ."
they were later <UNK> for not doing enough to protect private property .
"i wonder if south central had been an <UNK> of <UNK> corporate <UNK> and an ugly mob was <UNK> on it , what kind of force would be present ?"
"this , to me , is less <UNK> paranoia than it is a simple <UNK> of where the priorities possibly lie in today 's society ."
"ultimately , the movie shows some <UNK> working to show <UNK> of environmental <UNK> and engaging in dialogue with their <UNK> ."
it shows a clearly <UNK> kathy lee <UNK> finding out that clothing bearing her name is being made by <#> year olds being paid $ <#> an hour .
mcdonald 's is your kind of place ; they feed you <UNK> ; they throw them in your face ... etc .
"steven <UNK> now <UNK> that his theory of black holes is all wrong , which as many know is what i have been saying all along ..."
"well , this certainly looks interesting ."
i think it is an unfortunate choice of words myself urllink considering ...
there is a good bit of urllink <UNK> going on in washington these days .
i think the summer heat in that <UNK> must be getting to everybody ; either that or folks are kinda worried about that report being released tomorrow .
for years now on tuesdays i go to urllink the <UNK> pub .
i started going there a short time after urllink mark <UNK> had <UNK> the open mic from the <UNK> tap back in ' <#> .
"after he moved to houston in <#> , erin <UNK> started hosting ."
the wife and kid were out of town and it was starting to rain .
i <UNK> over the idea of skipping the whole thing but the phone rang and kris <UNK> offered to swing by and <UNK> me over .
i knew i would have gotten into hot water if i did n't show up .
<UNK> <UNK> had called earlier in the week to let me know she was coming in to celebrate her husband 's birthday and needed an <UNK> .
she was there <UNK> party <UNK> when kris and i <UNK> in and was in a mood to party .
"urllink greg <UNK> , john t , rockin ' rick wells , fred , craig , urllink seth , brett , and others ."
"there were some <UNK> new <UNK> and a <UNK> table smack in the middle that , apparently high as a <UNK> , absolutely loved everything that was being played ."
erin and jeff were doing an opening set .
"typically , back in the "" green room "" there is a <UNK> for discussion to turn political ."
"as <UNK> and worthwhile as blogs are , there is no substitute for good old face to face ranting ; even if beers occasionally get spilled ."
"erin sings like elvis , <UNK> lynn , ray charles , and <UNK> ."
like if she could n't she 'd go crazy .
too few people sing like their life depends on it and with a total <UNK> of <UNK> .
when this list swung into action i hopped around rather busy .
"we wrapped kris ' <#> song set with his original "" criminals from texas . "" a tune that is begging to be recorded ."
"in it , he <UNK> the <UNK> that gets discussed back in the green room so often ."
the song is <UNK> and powerful on its good nights .
"however , my <UNK> needed strings and was not at all fun to play and proving to be a distraction ."
"finding greg <UNK> <UNK> , i asked to borrow his beautiful taylor <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i played it the rest of the night , deeply grateful for greg ."
"the <UNK> that inspired the song originally now seem rather <UNK> , <UNK> stuff ."
"war , <UNK> , and <UNK> class warfare is much more <UNK> <UNK> content ."
"bobby <UNK> ( who got <UNK> moments earlier and had to take off ) , and kris ."
she wanted to try to do stuff in a lower register because she said the meds were messing with her high end .
"recently , on a night when i was guest hosting <#> bands insisted on signing up on the list and trying to set up on the small stage ."
the first band <UNK> in a couple large <UNK> and a kit that basically takes up the whole stage .
"we somehow get them wired up and they go into a <UNK> style metal frenzy that is supposed to get people rocking , but merely leaves them stunned ."
"the second band used <UNK> to drop samples into a crowded <UNK> mix that had some <UNK> going for it , but fit <UNK> in the room ."
"it never <UNK> to <UNK> me how these <UNK> , old <UNK> work their magic time after time with the <UNK> elements ."
"the lyrics punch and sway , the beat <UNK> , the breaks sing ."
2:30 of expression <UNK> to it 's core .
"i wish some of the new stuff with its <UNK> lyrics and <UNK> <UNK> that seeks to be profound , was profound ."
""" whole lotta <UNK> ' goin ' on "" was <UNK> danger <UNK> nearly <#> years ago . and that kind of material still gets people up ."
maybe there is a fundamental difference in music that gets you up and music that gets you down .
who the hell knows ... at this point the night is getting a sweaty <UNK> to it and the room is getting louder .
the night is <UNK> lightly and i step outside to breathe .
being unemployed in chicago in the summer when the music is floating out like big <UNK> balloons is somewhat <UNK> .
<UNK> was getting ready to go up and had a fairly big table cheering her on .
"she wanted to do "" <UNK> "" , but i 'll be damned if i 've ever played it ."
we <UNK> outside and started <UNK> the melody until we could get it worked out seconds before we were up .
<UNK> 's stuff is so fun to play that it is a shame the wicked soul is dead and ca n't write more .
""" i was in the house when the house <UNK> down "" is a favorite of mine that i played there shortly after he <UNK> off ."
"it 's a fine , fine tune . anyway ..."
"we got through "" <UNK> "" and did a blues in e and called it <UNK> ."
"she had had fun , i had fun and i was happy to be a part ."
"kevin miller , a <UNK> , was <UNK> an all star jam for his spot on the list ."
you never know what will happen unless you try it .
"this time , we did "" <UNK> "" followed by "" <UNK> monday "" and ended with some still left in the tank ."
it is only occasionally that covers are so <UNK> at the open mic .
"last week , it was virtually all original material and the place is a great , warm room to debut new material ."
but last night something in the summer air was calling for a night of <UNK> .
"jeff and erin brought the night to a finish with a brand - new original "" poor old <UNK> <UNK> "" ."
"now , once you have a mental image of a <UNK> <UNK> you have a rather precise idea of how the song sounds ."
"it was a suitable "" big finish "" ."
"ok , so let me see if i got all this ..."
the government will <UNK> that i give some of my money to <UNK> <UNK> to manage for retirement and health costs .
they will have <UNK> in turn <UNK> by the <UNK> and they can <UNK> at will in free and <UNK> markets .
"schools will be run by corporations , presumably with a board of directors that can <UNK> an all non - union <UNK> ."
"if i am unemployed i can use all the funds in my individual account , provided there are any ."
"if the grant has run out , the <UNK> can be used along with others to create paper <UNK> housing ."
the market can be a <UNK> old <UNK> that <UNK> spells on some days and talks perfect sense on others .
"smart money says you always treat him with a certain respect , like you do a slightly <UNK> old uncle ."
"you do n't let him drive to church on sundays , but you let him complain about your driving from the back seat with a certain amount of <UNK> ."
there are certain things that the <UNK> excel in and certain things they do not .
it is truly amazing that there is a <UNK> funded and <UNK> <UNK> that is shooting to the stars .
in <#> most <UNK> roads were toll roads built by private <UNK> .
it was decided that to increase the flow of goods and commerce this could be a public concern .
"lincoln , of course , prior to becoming the first elected republican president was a <UNK> during the time he served in the house ."
many who have served on a condo board cease to ever contemplate running for public office because they have terrible night <UNK> and sudden screaming fits .
i believe the <UNK> wish to <UNK> as much control as possible over the public sector while all the while <UNK> the common man striving for a <UNK> tomorrow .
they are more <UNK> for their <UNK> status than their status in the economy .
they deserve representation on par with large corporate interests who practically have bought seats in the <UNK> .
italy in the <UNK> actually let corporate interests have seats in their parliament .
it was called <UNK> and it begged to be destroyed .
"the people , represented not by corporate <UNK> or even political parties necessarily but by our direct involvement , have a say in our common <UNK> ."
"if <#> % percent of the public desire a single - <UNK> health care plan , then they should get it ."
the third way is not the end of private property or a socialist <UNK> .
"it seeks to define where <UNK> has a <UNK> interest and where common interest , or <UNK> interest shall carry <UNK> weight ."
there are some things to precious to be left to the will of the market .

last fall i began asking myself that question and attempted to research available data .
the most informative piece that i read was from an army master <UNK> who created a <UNK> for how to respond to an actual attack .
worst case scenario is a chemical attack such as what happened in the tokyo subway ( nerve gas ) .
less than <#> % of those injured and exposed died .
"<#> principal reason <UNK> agents , nerve gas , and bio weapons use"
"i may sound naive in saying this , but i think the threat is <UNK> ."
"after doing some reading ( from multiple sources , including war college <UNK> ) , i fear these weapons far less than i once did ."
"the nature of the perceived threat that iraq posed prior to the invasion is still not fully <UNK> , however ."
"without long range <UNK> , how were <UNK> going to <UNK> to do damage on foreign soil ?"
i simply have never seen a realistic scenario presented .
being a lovely audience is more vital to music than being a musician .
there are always more musicians and <UNK> than there are <UNK> .
"instead , they got up in mass and started <UNK> ' to the beat ."
"jazz is still around <#> years after it 's birth because a small , dedicated bunch of <UNK> keep it alive ."
the <UNK> of such a thing is that the musician tries to sense out where the room is and play to it .
good <UNK> try to give expression to what is the <UNK> <UNK> of a particular time and place .
demand from them to be entertained and make them give you something new and original .
they are the better for it and so is the music .
"to perform at gop convention well , here ' tis ."
i was curious who the grand - ole - <UNK> would hire to rave up the crowd .
"i pretty much figured wayne newton would be a draw , but there 's no mention of an act of such <UNK> ."

"of course , republicans have hopes that michael w. smith will cause all the christian right faithful to scream in <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> ."

"back during the start of the war , they sent wayne newton over to iraq to entertain a metallica - <UNK> bunch of <UNK> ."
that was hardly compassionate to either party .

artists who have a body of work <UNK> more than <#> minutes inherently have achieved a position to speak from that is not easily <UNK> .

it is part of their job and part of their tradition .
"if <UNK> are writing songs of <UNK> and finding a wide audience willing to listen , then there is something out there that probably needs to be spoken ."
i spent an hour on the <UNK> bike and burned <#> calories .
this is considered a light to moderate <UNK> workout but my room mate makes it out to an intense energy <UNK> exercise .
there 's a formula that says you need to burn <#> more calories than you take in to lose <#> pound of fat .
"without proper training and diet , you could lose muscle mass once your <UNK> levels are <UNK> and your fat stores barely touched ."
"if you are losing more than <#> pounds a week , you are most likely losing muscle mass along with your fat ."
"in my case , i do n't want that ."
i actually do n't want to lose any weight .
weight training burns more calories than an <UNK> workout for the same period of time but it 's a <UNK> <UNK> exercise .
it 's going to burn fuel from what you eat and what 's stored as <UNK> .
<UNK> exercise is <UNK> mostly by free <UNK> <UNK> which come from your body fat stores .
i 'm not saying weight training is not good for burning fat because weight training does increase your <UNK> rate more than <UNK> exercise does . you need both .
it 's just that <UNK> exercise is a better <UNK> on how much fat you are losing during an exercise .
then the weight training helps you to store whatever energy you are getting from food back to the muscles and not to fat .
that 's my key goal in my workout schedule .
"it 's not to cut <#> calories from my diet , but to burn <#> calories from fat stores with <UNK> exercise to lose that pound of fat ."
i 'm happy i 'm losing the fat but it just shows how small my chest really is .
my room mate suggested doing strength training on the chest and <UNK> day and worry about <UNK> that area up later .
i 'm not expecting a huge chest overnight .
"after the chest and <UNK> workout , we did <UNK> on a <UNK> bike for about <#> minutes ."
i kept my heart rate up to <#> but it took me about <#> to <#> minutes before my heart rate even got up to that level .
my room mate keeps trying to go on the atkins diet but never seems to last a week on it .
i personally think it 's stupid to <UNK> yourself of carbs .
i think it 's better just to watch your <UNK> intake if you are wanting to lose fat .
"since i 'm trying to lose fat and not lose lean body mass , i 'm more about just increasing <UNK> than anything else ."
i 'm not even watching the <UNK> intake that hard .
i 'm also not <UNK> on food for <UNK> up either ( i may do that later when my body fat percentage gets low enough ) .
"i have n't lost any weight since i 've been working out , but you can see by the pics , i have lost some fat ."
"urllink well , i have agreed a fee with the <UNK> and already <UNK> are <UNK> themselves passing bits of paper backwards and <UNK> ."
""" i do n't need to see anything "" . which gives me the same feeling as when i win at the <UNK> ."
<UNK> happy <UNK> the thought of how much better off i would have been if i 'd opted for a higher stake .

he said he can even give me a <UNK> inside a week .
"on the other hand , they do have an internet and i 'll probably be bored senseless so i may post more than ever ."
urllink the downside of pr is that today i appeared in the newspaper .
the picture looked terrible and i sounded like a right <UNK> <UNK> .
well by <#> am this morning this note was put through the door .
i would like to make a cash offer to buy your house and could complete in a couple of days .
"urllink before i fly out to <UNK> , the biggest problem i still have to face is selling my house ."
"many years ago , in my days before switching to the dark side that is pr , i was a hack ."
"<#> of my least favourite chores , week in , week out , was writing the bloody property section ."
so i thought - why not drop them an email ?
"i mean , "" <UNK> goes to vietnam - needs to sell house quick , "" is n't such a bad story ."
by property press standards it 's not such a bad story .
would they like me to write a press release ?
"can i arrange some pictures for them ? and guess what , they said yes , yes and we 'll send our own photographer ."
"bearing in mind that writing press releases is what i do for a living , it 's nice to be able to write <#> about myself for a change ."
only problem was - when i got to the sign - off stage i felt i needed extra <UNK> .
finally a job when i do n't have to clear everything with a client and i still need someone to say it 's okay .
"anyway , i eventually told myself it was fine and <UNK> it ."
if this gets a big splash in the property section then it might go along way towards selling the house .
"i reckon if i could just shift the house , then all the other <#> pieces of <UNK> would fit nicely into place ."
i thought i had better make <#> thing clear .
despite what the blog says i am not yet in vietnam .
the estate agent was coming round to value the place .
i spent <#> solid hours of <UNK> and <UNK> out crap and she still turned her nose up and suggested i get in some professional <UNK> .
then she <UNK> to value the place at a good <UNK> less than i thought .
"it might sound quite a religious thing to say , but i 'm really looking forward to be <UNK> ."
"give or take , of course , a pack on my back ."
the house has been a great place to live but it was still just a house .
of the rest of my stuff i 'll keep the clothes i 'll be taking with me .
i 'll keep a couple of suits at me <UNK> 's too .
my cd 's can go in a box in the <UNK> .
no <#> is getting their hands on them .
"but that leaves me with beds , coffee tables , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , pots , <UNK> , plates and cups to get rid of ."
the vague plan is to send out an email to people i know and ask if anyone wants any of it .
the larger stuff they can have on a long term loan .
i 've also been given the contact details of a charity that helps <UNK> <UNK> .
that'll be worth it just to annoy any daily mail readers i may have accidently <UNK> .
i ca n't wait till i 've finished all my training .
then i can really enjoy a last beer in the <UNK> .
"today , urllink car explosion kills <#> near <UNK> ."
hotel . and urllink a pipe bomb exploded in a manhattan subway station on monday .
now here 's something i never would have <UNK> urllink sammy <UNK> 's federal campaign contributions . and
this after hearing multiple brush - with - drunken - greatness stories over the weekend about what an ass he was to multiple people .
really awesome post at urllink iraq the model .
the parts in bold are ali 's ' <UNK> and <UNK> ' to the ' not in our name ' <UNK> .
the whole thing is hysterical ( not just because a native - <UNK> - speaker is <UNK> a document written by americans ) .
"money quote : president bush has declared : "" you’re either with us or you’re against us . """
we refuse to allow you to speak for all the american people .
we will not give up our right to question .
we will not hand over our <UNK> in return for a hollow promise of safety .
"we say do n't free them , not in our name ."
we refuse to be party to these wars and we <UNK> any <UNK> that they are being <UNK> in our name or for our welfare .
what do you say in your first - ever blog posting ?
"hi , please come back if this is the only post you see ."
"if this is the oldest of a bunch of posts , then yes , this was the first post ."
"you have reached the end of the internet , please go back now ."
"soon there will be a wealth of current events commentary , irritating observations , and other nonsense ."

cds this will be short as it ’s saturday .
"the <UNK> actually likes cds , although he was very annoyed when they first <UNK> the market and caught he and mrs ."
<UNK> was a member of a music club of some kind at the time and was offered a very good deal on the complete <UNK> of <UNK> .
"at first , the <UNK> was stubborn and would not give them up ."
"he even found an electronics store in fort <UNK> , co , that <UNK> replacement needles for his still - functioning <UNK> <UNK> and bought several ."
"now that cds are not a fad , however , the <UNK> has <UNK> to the inevitable and mrs ."
<UNK> is now replacing some of the <UNK> we had .
something you haven’t heard of pops it ’s head up and <UNK> to send you right back to the stone age again .
the reason that the <UNK> likes cds is because they don’t have to be cleaned all the time and don’t have that annoying <UNK> and <UNK> that <UNK> had .
"plus , the <UNK> does not have to <UNK> the <UNK> looking for a <UNK> needle ."
he may be suspicious of technology but he ’s not crazy .
"there is supposed to be some other sound advantage to cds , but the <UNK> does not know what it is ."
picture phones the <UNK> has already talked about <UNK> phones in an earlier piece .
"now he is going to talk about their bastard cousins , picture phones ."
"yeah , the <UNK> doesn’t get it either ."
"there is a <UNK> to the picture phone , but the <UNK> doesn’t know what it is ."
he doesn’t know how much power they use or what a low battery might do to its picture - taking or sending qualities .
"also , he doesn’t know how much longer you have to stay on the phone while <UNK> <#> of these things ."
"this would eliminate the dreaded slide show , which seems to happen after every vacation , but other than that , the <UNK> sees no advantage in it ."
the people on vacation have this weird idea that other people actually want to see what they are looking at .
"they want to be on vacation , not look at pictures from someone else ’s ."
but that is getting a bit off the track .
"why not just take the shot with a camera , pay for the printing and to hell with the phone company ."
"doing it the other way seems like another expense , like going on vacation with <#> spare tires ."
"<UNK> <#> yesterday , the <UNK> wrote about the fact that he does not have cable television ."
this <UNK> some <UNK> that all the <UNK> has is a little black - and - white portable .
"the point was how important cable television has become to this society , not the equipment the <UNK> has , if this remark was even serious at all ."
"the set was <UNK> to <UNK> anyway , so he asked the <UNK> if he wanted it ."
"since the <UNK> ’s existing <UNK> system <#> <UNK> out a month after his friend left , it is good that the <UNK> said ‘"
<UNK> even though his main motivation was that it was summer and he was tired of moving stuff . since it was brought up anyway
the <UNK> has seen the large home - entertainment systems with the <UNK> screens .
"the <UNK> thinks they look nice but if you are looking for some kind of compliment , you aren’t going to get <#> ."
tv screens don’t particularly interest me unless there is a football game on that i want to see .
"otherwise , it ’s just a box with colored lights in it ."
the television set has settled into a <UNK> in this society that is almost <UNK> .
"however , there is a difference between going camping and bringing the entire house with you ."
going into the great outdoors makes you more <UNK> of what you have when you get back .
"somehow , having a tv with you ruins all of that ."
television here is something that the <UNK> is told is remarkable .
"in this world of multiple channels , the <UNK> does not have cable tv and has not had it for over a year ."
he has never seen an episode of the <UNK> .
"except for a <UNK> of fear factor that the <UNK> saw while doing the laundry , he has never seen reality tv ."
"it went something like this : cable person : good morning , mr ."
cable provider : i mean who supplies your town with cable tv ?
"cable provider : well , they must send out a bill , sir ."
who do you make the check out to ?
cable provider : [ <UNK> ] not even basic ?
"cable provider : [ <UNK> but trying to rally ] well , would you consider signing up with us ?"
me : because the $ <#> a month i’d pay for your product goes for groceries .
it ’s more important to me to eat .
well we have some very exciting packages available .
"me : look , the simple fact is that i don’t want anything you have to offer ."
"when i was living in a condo , i could afford it ."
"now that i have a house , i can’t ."
i actually have an <UNK> hooked up to this house and to my set .
i can get everything i want through the air with that .
all i have to do is sit through some commercials and i have a remote to <UNK> those .
"well we have channels for <UNK> <UNK> me : i’m sure you do , but i’m not interested right now ."
cable provider : [ <UNK> ] but out terms are very reasonable .
me : choosing between eating and watching a <UNK> on the cartoon channel does not sound very reasonable to me .
"cable folk would disagree , but it ’s true ."
"after a year of doing without , he doesn’t really miss it either ."
the rates would probably drop <UNK> as more and more people left .
this was his reaction to the bad kind of surprise .
i have lots of <UNK> supporting my <UNK> that compromise designs are always a bad thing . here
"’s <#> you’ve probably never heard of : the <UNK> , which was the name of a world war i machine gun , designed by a committee ."
"anyway , the <UNK> didn’t just jam ; this thing made a habit out of <UNK> just when you needed it the most ."
soldiers going over the top in any attack that <UNK> on the <UNK> just knew it was going to fail .
they knew it was a bad idea from bitter experience .
originally it was to be a completely <UNK> vehicle .
"then , for some reason , a committee got together and suddenly , just the rocket <UNK> on the sides of the big main tank were <UNK> ."
<UNK> ’s whole point was that the space shuttle is a <UNK> explosion waiting to happen .
now this damn thing has killed <#> people and the word is that we will not replace the columbia as we did the <UNK> .
the <UNK> is just grateful that we flew more than a <#> missions with it and got away with a death toll under <#> .
this was a mindset so severe that a popular criticism of something that otherwise got the job done was “
"well , it doesn’t advance the technology very much ."
"apparently , no <#> shot back that something burning up on <UNK> doesn’t either ."
there is a lot of talk about replacing the space shuttle <UNK> with something that is more up - to - date .
"the endeavor , the replacement for the <UNK> , cost something like $ <#> <#> big ones ."
why should we be spending that kind of money on a big <UNK> ?
"meanwhile , we still have an <UNK> space station to <UNK> and the space shuttle is the best bet to do that ."
people <UNK> <UNK> from their back yards sure aren’t going to take up the slack .
people have a need to personally go and see what ’s around the corner .
this is not just an idle flight of fancy .
"for government to try and shut it off is not only <UNK> but <UNK> as well because <UNK> , this need can be <UNK> ."
<UNK> jumping is only the first <UNK> <UNK> on this road .
<UNK> so the <UNK> hopes that we won’t abandon space .
"it ’s too big , too grand , and too important for us not to turn our attention to it ."
i think we should just look at the space shuttle as a mistake that is way <UNK> for a change .
"hell , we don’t even belong here , but mass suicide sure isn’t the answer ; neither is giving up on space ."
<UNK> ’s the <UNK> has never had a <UNK> . ever .
"<UNK> stands for , as i am sure you must know by now , personal digital assistant ."
they used to be a little smaller than a brick .
their job was to hold phone numbers and little notes for <UNK> later .
apple computers developed it during the reign of the now - hated john <UNK> in the early 80s .
i say this to point out that <UNK> aren’t exactly new .
the first time i ever ran into a <UNK> was in the form of the newton in the 80s .
"newton ’s were infamous for screwing up anything you wrote on them , sometimes with <UNK> hilarious results ."
they were <UNK> in the late 90s in the form of the palm pilot .
the <UNK> was in the fact that it could accept information and phone numbers from other palm <UNK> .
"even though the <UNK> missed out on this sort of thing , he could imagine high - class folk in bars ‘"
"<UNK> their phone numbers to people they found attractive across the room , especially after a few <UNK> ."
the <UNK> is perfectly aware that the words ‘ palm <UNK> refer to a specific product made by a company and that he should use the more generic ‘
"however , the <UNK> does not have too much sympathy for this position as companies spend billions trying to associate their product with a certain function , like ‘"
<UNK> so they have to take any bad that comes their way along with the good .
new <UNK> ’s also collect and play music and function as tape <UNK> .
a lot of the time they are the <UNK> equivalent of <UNK> juice .
this is something that just has to make the <UNK> sure happy .
"i see people with <UNK> phones all the time , but i have never seen anyone with a <UNK> ."
"i’m sure people have them , but i never see any ."
"it ’s not as cool as a <UNK> , but the <UNK> is past caring and figures that such a <UNK> thing will be back in <UNK> soon ."
the pen is a <UNK> that the <UNK> picked up on an interview .
that is at least an additional $ <#> the <UNK> can spend on booze .
no call the <UNK> got a phone call from someone <UNK> to be at a <UNK> .
then he offered to help me with what he said was the terribly - high interest i was being charged for my credit cards the other night .
"believe it or not , i had been expecting something like this ."
"i do that sometimes , something like the way john d. <UNK> used to think up accounting <UNK> for his books ."
"they got around to passing this law late in <#> , even though <UNK> had been <UNK> people ’s supper long before then ."
"well , the first week of <UNK> for the list , <#> people wanted to sign up ."
any <UNK> the <UNK> has ever had for the <UNK> that people in this country have for <UNK> was <UNK> when i read that <UNK> .
"if i’m <UNK> , i’ve got lots of company ."
i wonder how much money the state will collect in <UNK> .
the very presence of exceptions made me wonder how long it was going to take for someone to figure out a way around the no - call list .
"the <UNK> got a junk call from <#> of the exceptions on june <#> , <#> ."
that ’s about <#> months since the no - call list was passed by the <UNK> .
i’m not <UNK> ; i just think the whole point of the bill is to prevent <UNK> .
i can barely wait to see what they come up with to ‘ <UNK> spam .
"if you think the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , you would be right ."
i’m on the no - call list ; even though i didn’t think it would work .
"i have <UNK> a long and <UNK> battle against these <UNK> , which i will <UNK> to anyone unfortunate enough to get within <UNK> ."
"during this battle , i have pretended to be a <UNK> old lady and a man with a hearing problem , all to no avail ."
"in this long and bitter struggle , the only thing that has worked for me is telling them you have had a stroke ."
"to my <UNK> , the <UNK> heard the <UNK> sound of turning pages , a <UNK> apology and then a dial tone ."
"life - threatening <UNK> in their script , yet they feel they have to say something , so they fall back on ‘"
i’m <UNK> the only bad thing about this approach is that you still have to answer the phone .
"thus , my presence on the no - call list ."
"even though i was <UNK> about the thing working , hope <UNK> eternal ."
"it might turn out to be another club in our bag , so to speak ."
"the <UNK> is now used to getting machines on the phone , but <#> calling me is still a novel experience ."
what really freaks the <UNK> out is that once on my answering machine there was a call from another machine .
it was a call from a <UNK> with an <#> number offering to help me reduce my interest rate if i just called them .
"what do <UNK> and <UNK> have in common with urllink this woman of miami beach , <UNK> ?"
"well , they both have the same dying wish ."
i think the only thing being made less stable by the arrow is mr .
it was the threat of an <UNK> system that caused the soviet union to spend itself into <UNK> .
and that was a threat against the soviet empire .
this is a reality against a bunch of <UNK> third world <UNK> .
"whenever the democrat <UNK> looks like a <UNK> , the dem 's urllink complain that its a republican conspiracy to make the <UNK> look like a <UNK> ."
you do n't need a conspiracy to make this <UNK> look like a <UNK> .
so i just got done reading the urllink <UNK> between bill <UNK> and michael moore at the <UNK> convention .
"moore just keeps ranting about sending the "" children "" in to fight for a "" lie . """
"first , there <UNK> wmd 's in iraq !"
does n't anyone remember the <UNK> in the <UNK> they found on the <UNK> ?
"second , we do n't send children into war !"
"and , we do n't have a draft ."
"if he wants to keep saying silly things like this , i 'm going to have to tell his mother ."
"third , <UNK> and moore both said that bush said this was for an "" <UNK> threat . "" except that he never said that ."
"in fact , he said that we needed to do this before the threat became <UNK> ."
"fourth , moore said that bush kept saying there was a supposed connection between iraq and <#> ."
he said there was a connection between iraq and al <UNK> .
he never said they <UNK> specifically on <#> .
"so , on every point moore is the <#> who 's lying ."
"so i was checking into this "" separation "" thing regarding the help with the flood ."
the lady who is <UNK> the whole effort at the <UNK> is in my church .
"i went up to her and asked "" why has n't the church been sending anyone to help ? """
"the look on her face told me she 'd obviously heard the "" rumors "" and was sick of them ."
"the only thing worse than if this is true , is that this is false ."
"i mean , this is just a distraction from doing the work that really needs to be done ."
"so , i gave her my number and said i 'd like to help ."
"unfortunately , i have to coach <#> more weeks of flag football ."
this is annoying ( but that 's another story ) .
i 'll try to help a little bit here and there in the meantime .
"so some of you may have heard of our recent <UNK> in <UNK> county , nj ."
i have friend who lost almost everything he owns .
"well , the church i attend ( fellowship alliance chapel , <UNK> , nj ) has been helping out with people and material , and <UNK> ."
"but , my town ( <UNK> ) got hit as bad , if not worse , than <UNK> ."
our church has n't sent any <UNK> to my town .
on a work crew assignment today someone told me that the genius mayor ( or someone ? ) in <UNK> turned down the offer of help from the church .
"they were told its because they 're concerned about "" separation of church and state . """
"i do n't know who said this , or even if its accurate ."
"but i promise you this : i will get to the bottom of this and if its true , i will have a new mission in my life ."
my mission will be to completely lay waste to the political career of whoever has done this !
the guy at the fire department who <UNK> the <UNK> on the <UNK> truck ?
( you can maybe hold his towels for him though ... maybe . )
urllink eddie george is headed to dallas .
he came so close to being loved by a whole city .
"how , you may ask , do i <UNK> these <#> seemingly <UNK> things ?"
lets look at the <UNK> - <UNK> controversy .
"rush said : <UNK> the media are a bunch of <UNK> , and <UNK> that <UNK> is <UNK> ."
anyone care to argue ? ... thought not .
i can understand someone coming to that conclusion .
"because , quite frankly , he has not lived up to the hype ."
"either he was over - <UNK> , or he is under - achieving ."
"rush believes the former , while i believe the latter ."
"anyway , its all for <UNK> at the moment ."
( there are rumors that eddie george wants to come to philly ... do n't know . )
"perhaps we will see who is right this season . because with all of these <UNK> , there are no more excuses for <UNK> ."
either he <UNK> or i 'm going to start <UNK> with rush .
"<UNK> is currently ( as of this writing ) flashing a quote from john edwards , saying <UNK> leaders told him they ( essentially ) want bush to lose ."
oil - for - <UNK> - germany and russia ?
"well , now the detailed press reports are starting to come out ."
"believe me , folks , you do n't do what he says he did just by accident ."
you follow the procedure to <UNK> and/or eliminate any potential for accidents like that . and this was not just a single document or <#> .
this is ( from press reports ) over <#> pages of notes that left without approval .
its amazing how many people have to fall on the sword for the clinton 's .
"web <UNK> , susan <UNK> , and now sandy <UNK> ."
"i like the way <UNK> put it , "" why ca n't this guy just steal furniture like the rest of the clinton people ? """
"posted <UNK> now , on to past actual experiences ."
"as i may have stated , i do have experience in the <UNK> field ."
this is a description of my first experience .
i learned of a <UNK> party that was being hosted by a <UNK> <UNK> that was based in the la area .
"the <UNK> was urllink <UNK> , who still hosts them ."
"i went to the halloween <#> party , and that was my “ coming out ” party ."
"let me say this , it was a great relief to find others that liked the same subject ."
"the first night that i was there , a general reception was held in the lobby of the hotel ."
"i remember asking and being asked about how each of us discovered our interest in <UNK> , what our actual interests were , ect ."
"it was my first time , and i told her , she didn’t care ."
"i recall loving the feeling of a woman over my lap , wanting a spanking !"
"damn , if this world can be fun at times ! !"
"she had wanted moderate , and i was told that i did a perfect job , even being a first <UNK> ."
"well , i had experience , i had <UNK> myself , so i could <UNK> the <UNK> somewhat ."
and i knew the “ sweet ” spot on a butt too .
"that was sheer pleasure for me , and i know she enjoyed it too ."
<#> of the scenes i especially remember that night was when a gentleman was just <UNK> on a beautiful blond .
"she was barely giving a reaction , and when he was done , she stood up , smiling !"
"i immediately noticed that she had a significant other there , so i considered her <UNK> , except to <UNK> ."
"such a beautiful woman , whom by the way was english , with a sexy british accent , blond , and into spanking !"
"as i later discovered , she was a switch , and ended up being the life of the party ."
"i never had the opportunity to engage her , but i watch in awe !"
"the second day was a saturday , and i took the opportunity to visit a local <UNK> <UNK> called club <UNK> ."
"you can tour this facility on line , and learn more about it at urllink <UNK> ."
"i took a cab ride to there , and was extremely excited about my first total experience in <UNK> ."
"at the time , i really did not know whether i was dominant or submissive , but felt that i was both ."
they assigned me a switch named “ rose ” to tour the facility .
"while there i remember hearing a girl <UNK> , and that just got me going !"
"this rose then sat with me to interview me , and to find what i was looking for ."
"now they are supposedly legally <UNK> as a <UNK> , so the girls are able to go nude in session ."
so i was interested in exploring the <UNK> world with her .
"so she charged my credit card , and we went into <#> of the <UNK> rooms ."
"she started to take off her skirt and underwear , then <UNK> me to do the same , since i was a little <UNK> ."
"such a beautiful round bottom , skin so white , and ready for me to <UNK> at my pleasure ."
"so , as she <UNK> , i started in on her lightly ."
"we had conversation as i went along , and every once in a while , i would give her a hard slap just to get a reaction ."
"then we switched , and she started on me ."
"what pleasure , laying across a beautiful woman ’s lap , ready for a spanking ."
"she started in on me , but for me , it was like playing , my pain tolerance was way higher , and i said i was bored ."
"so , she had me stand up , and she got a small <UNK> ."
"yea , it had a bit of bit to it , but it really was not much ."
"then she brought in another dominant for a few minutes , and they double <UNK> me ."
"especially when rose was called out for a minute or <#> , and the dominant was trying to get more out of me ."
"so she concentrated on the area between my butt cheeks , and"
"wow , a few of those , and she had my attention ! !"
"then rose came back , and she put me into a <UNK> mechanism that held my arms high and wide , and my ankles wide ."
"she admired my <UNK> status , and for a moment i thought she might do something with it ."
"she proceeded with a <UNK> on my butt , and really started in on me ."
"i was <UNK> , but damn if i would use that “ safe ” word ."
"it wasn’t long , and she let me down , and we finished the session with me spanking her again , and rubbing that fine ass of hers ."
", they got in a new <UNK> , and rose <UNK> it <UNK> , and had <#> of the men waiting give her a couple of <UNK> ."
"i meeting , she learned of the party , and later attended , making sure i noticed her ."
"she apparently made contact with the <UNK> of shadow lane , as she told me in conversation that night that she had discussed doing a video with them ."
"and she followed through on that , as i saw her later as “ <UNK> severe ” ."
"while we were talking , i felt a certain vibe with her , and i often wonder if she intended to pursue a relationship ."
"but i often wonder , had i <UNK> it , if i could have eventually dated her ."
"oh <UNK> that night was a lot of organized , and <UNK> activity ."
"while i did not participate , i did watch several good <UNK> ."
"i watched <#> woman , that i was familiar with from <UNK> - west get a hard <UNK> spanking until she <UNK> ."
"she was <UNK> satisfied , and it took a long time for her to recover from it ."
then back to the blond i spoke of earlier .
"in <#> of the party rooms , she had her skirt raised , panties down , and was bent over for the cane !"
and a guy was giving her so pretty good strokes too .
"she was having some strong reactions , but seemed to be enjoying it too ."
there were a few <UNK> left by that too .
"i am convinced that she went on to enjoy a lifestyle of strong harsh <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
"<#> finds , while drunk , that proper <UNK> , though useful , is often an <UNK> ."
"if you have not read any <UNK> , do yourself the favor ."
my new favorite bar is experiencing an <UNK> .
owners are pulling in opposite directions and the cool owner is at wit 's end .
"the cool owner , we 'll call him chuck built this place and made it what it is ."
"the asshole owner , we 'll call him asshole , is now trying to step in and change things ."
"aside from the soap - opera like qualities of the situation , there is my personal tragedy of losing the perfect neighborhood bar ."
"clearly , this is the greater tragedy and my <UNK> of faithful sheep , uh , readers will send me money and/or women ."
"aside : if any employees of said bar were to read this , you know that i am taking dramatic license in claiming that it is my tragedy ."
i have made new friends amongst the staff and i do n't want to see them leave .
"ok , <UNK> and <UNK> are probably exceptions , do n't try to write while overly drunk ."
"i never visit home - not for christmas , not for thanksgiving ."
"yet <UNK> , i am my mom 's favorite child and she is a master of the guilt - trip ."
so i 'm laying in bed ' till noon weighing the pros and cons of killing myself vs. going to dallas when i realize
i can eat an entire bag of urllink <UNK> cookies without asking for permission !
i can walk around the house naked but for <UNK> placed peanut butter !
"i make my own decisions , <UNK> with error though they may be ."
"the clouds parted , the sun <UNK> my hair and bunny rabbits and <UNK> <UNK> through the gently blowing grass ."
i wonder if i can get my $ <#> back .
"until i got the notice in the mail , i thought it had all happened about <#> years ago ."
"interestingly , this <#> year period had somehow contained the ten - year reunion ."
"i had no desire to go to that <#> , but after <#> years , i might actually enjoy seeing a few of these people again ."
i always enjoy the trips to the bio - <UNK> lab .
the laughter is so <UNK> - literally - and they always give me a <UNK> - pop when i leave .
i should probably visit my mom while i 'm in dallas .
i have to make sure someone comes to feed chairman <UNK> von uni - ball .
"not yet , the fire - ball is still in the sky ."
there is no topic more fascinating then the <UNK> between men and women .
maybe i 'm a slut ; i want them all .
"chapter <#> after a recent date , a friend asked how it went ."
"i <UNK> to her that although the woman i had seen was very smart , attractive , etc ."
", i was tired of injured birds ( little <UNK> ones like <UNK> ) with broken wings who are scared of <UNK> into the sky ."
"lately and with good reasons , my friend has been acting as though she thinks she 's a <UNK> with a broken wing ."
"in <UNK> , she 's a beautiful eagle who could eat <UNK> for lunch , but she has locked herself inside a cage ."
i want her out of the cage and flying .
"the beauty of this is that she can not laugh at me because as soon as she starts laughing , it will be with me ."
"this week 's survey : in a completely <UNK> survey this weekend , i asked my mom who the greatest person on earth might be ."
"imagine my suprise and humble acceptance when she told me that i was not only the greatest person on earth , but also the smartest and most handsome ."
she then had the <UNK> to ask the greatest person on earth when she was going to get additional <UNK> .
"be sure to check next week 's results when i ask my cat , "" if my name is <UNK> , who is your god ? "" <UNK>"
"a beautiful woman i was <UNK> with recently had the "" i can bring home the bacon , fry it up in a pan ..."
""" song running through her head and asked , "" what was that advertising : cigarettes , bacon - <UNK> <UNK> , what ?"
""" my answer : in early <#> , the grocery store chain , <UNK> <UNK> produced a bacon - <UNK> <UNK> named slippery - pig ."
"the earlier "" pork - a - lot "" name was abandoned when farmers came in looking for a place to store their pigs ."
"- was n't testing well with their target <UNK> , so they <UNK> it "" <UNK> "" and sold it as perfume ."
"strangely enough , she seems to have found this story entertaining ."
maybe i had found the right woman after all these years of bad choices .
"i smiled on the drive home , imagining our future life together ."
i was filled with a warm glow and felt peace ... even though i had just dropped $ <#> on that whore .
i have a cousin of mine whose name is <UNK> .
well she is not so attractive by face but as far as her body is concerned she has got a killing body .
she is little fat but i like <UNK> girls .
i never thought of having sex with her and never even <UNK> about her .
it was she who gave me <#> of the most wonderful experience of my life .
i told her that no body was at home .
but she said that she would like to stay .
i said ok and asked her to have a seat .
i offered her a cold drink and then i came back to my room and turned off the computer .
then i went back to the living room and started chatting with her .
after some time she said that she wanted to ask me some thing .
then i asked her that what she wanted to ask .
after <UNK> for a while she said “ do you know thing about sex ” .
that question rang a bell in my mind that some thing clever was going on in her mind .
"i said yes , i know a lot about sex , what do u want to know ."
she said that i want to know every thing .
at first i started telling her about kissing and then slowly i moved further .
she seemed to be enjoying it as she was listening to with great attention .
then i started telling her that how a man sucks the breasts and lick the <UNK> of a female and hoe a female sucks the penis of a man .
she said that i don’t believe that a female sucks the penis of a man .
"i said , what if i give you a proof ."
i went in to the room turned on the video player .
before playing it i told her she will watch the movie with relaxed mind and she will enjoy it .
i turned it on and now she was watching it .
she was deeply involved in that movie and was watching all that sucking and licking carefully .
when in the movie the man started to fuck the girl i told her that it is great pleasure for the female .
i started to rub my hands on her neck and she was enjoying it .
i laid her down on the bed and started kissing her lips and then rest of her lovely body .
then i asked her to remove her under wear but she said that i can’t
<UNK> said ok and kept on sucking on her boobs .
my cock was as hard and hot like a heated iron rod .
i removed my pants and my cock <UNK> out .
she took it in her hand and started rubbing it .
then i moved my hand in to her underwear and started rubbing her cunt which was already hot as fire .
soon she removed her under wear her self and started licking her hot and sweet cunt like hungry dog .
"then she said <UNK> , please do it to me ."
i pointed my rod at her cunt and said “ are you ready ” .
she said yes and i slowly moved it in to her sweet hole .
and then slowly i started to move faster .
after some time i took my cock out and asked her to suck it .
she was not ready to do it but when i forced her she took it in her mouth .
soon she started enjoying it and was sucking it more hardly .
i took my dick out of her mouth and soon i was throwing white <UNK> in the air .
then we took bath together during which we also made also made love many times .
we loved each other very much and had sex many times .
time flies ... unless you 're broke it has now been over <#> full month since i was fired .
she brought me a birthday card that was from the gm at the studio .
"i did n't expect the gm to remember my birthday -- heck , with everything going on , i almost forgot about it ."
but then i thought that it was a pretty lame gesture .
"if i was <UNK> enough for her to remember my birthday , then why did n't she do anything to fight for me ?"
she has to know that my <UNK> was a <UNK> .
"so if she 's feeling that guilty about it , then a birthday card is a poor excuse for not at least giving me a <UNK> package ."
"my health insurance "" <UNK> "" payments will be $ <#> a month if i decide to continue on the company plan ."
"the <UNK> is much cheaper , but why pay for something that offers no real coverage ?"
"i 'm a cancer survivor , and the <UNK> tests they run on me are n't covered by the standard <UNK> ."
"i leave messages with <UNK> and <UNK> , and nothing ."
not even a return call after i 've had an interview .
"i always perform the required "" follow up "" call or drop an email <UNK> them for their time ."
i even sent a <UNK> <UNK> to the big studio that granted me an interview last month .
i 've also noticed that my colleagues and old friends in the business have suddenly become quite <UNK> .
now all of a sudden it 's as if i 've <UNK> <UNK> .
it seriously makes me wonder if the studio is spreading rumors about the details of my <UNK> .
"they 're allowed to say i was dismissed , but that 's it ."
anything else can be considered <UNK> and a <UNK> of my character .
"even if it is a pack of lies , it could hurt my chances of <UNK> a new position ."
"as it is , it 's already <UNK> my chances of collecting unemployment , and that 's bad enough ."
""" <UNK> online , the employment web pages of the major <UNK> , and any leads my few remaining friends might hear of on the rather <UNK> industry <UNK> ."
"-- on may 6th , <#> i was fired from my job at the studio , after <#> years of being a truly loyal employee ."
i do n't even think they realize just how loyal i really was .
"i mean , i went through eleven months of <UNK> while i was there and"
in that time i only missed <#> day of work .
"if that 's not a team player , i do n't know what is ."
i am positive it 's a personal <UNK> from the it department head .
i found out ( totally by accident ) that he may have received a <UNK> on a piece of software that he advised the company to buy .
we users were asked to keep track of any <UNK> .
"but every time i sent in another "" <UNK> report "" ( and there were many )"
he apparently took it as a personal <UNK> to his authority .
both of these <UNK> are lies -- the same guy that got me fired for the zip drive actually suggested that i buy <#> about <#> years earlier .
"the downloaded hack <UNK> is nothing more than total bunk , and a complete <UNK> ."
but i 'm sure that our it department head <UNK> that little detail when he put in the demand for my <UNK> .
"nor were any of the files ' owners asked about the documents , either ."
"had i been sexually <UNK> or <UNK> against , then we 'd have a different <UNK> of fish ."
"at any rate , i am looking for a new position ."
"so far there 's been only a few bites and no real offers , but i 'm trying to stay optimistic ."
i had a couple of interviews in the last week that seemed promising .
and i 'm getting some nice <UNK> done .
"i may have to take a job in another field , although after doing this for so long , i would n't know where to start ."
"i do n't know if i will actually send this letter , but i do feel better having written it ."
"i guess the pouring out of all those thoughts and emotions is <UNK> , at least to a point ."
( the studio 's real name has been <UNK> to protect the innocent and avoid potential <UNK> . )
i am <UNK> by my <UNK> from the studio .
"because of the actions , <UNK> , and <UNK> of a <UNK> , <UNK> person or persons , an honest woman 's entire career has been destroyed ."
i am suddenly faced with the knowledge that honesty and hard work have no value anymore .
""" the real loser in all of this is the studio ."
"my career may be gone , but i will eventually find another job ."
"however , the studio has lost a truly honest and dedicated employee ."
"i sincerely cared about my job , the company for which i worked , and especially the people who worked alongside me ."
i truly believed that the studio was that company .
i <UNK> wanted the studio to be that company .
"i was prepared and willing to ride out any <UNK> , and hopefully contribute to and celebrate the good <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i spent <#> years working as hard as i knew how to try and help make those good <UNK> a reality .
""" but i have learned that hard work and honest dedication are no longer <UNK> as they once were in this world ."
"i refuse to hurt anyone as i have been hurt , or to damage anyone as i have been damaged ."
", i can only hope that some lesson can be learned from all of this ."
""" i do n't know if i will ever see you or speak with you again ."
"i am not sure if i will find another job in the film industry , or even , at this point , if i want to ."
"this experience has cast a shadow over my optimism , and has <UNK> any joy i may have ever had for my work ."
"but please know , i was an honest , <UNK> , and truly dedicated employee ."
"and although i have been deeply <UNK> , i bear no ill will to you or to the studio ."
i sincerely hope for you all of the success and happiness you may desire .
"i will miss my job , and i very much miss the wonderful people i had the honor of working with ."
i wish all the best to all of you .
""" <UNK> yours , yada - <UNK> "" so like i said ... it feels good to put all of these thoughts into words ."
i need an opinion on this -- would it do more damage than good ?
or is it a <UNK> of truths that an employer needs to hear ( and not enough people have the <UNK> to say ) ?
i would really like to hear your thoughts on this .
as the stomach <UNK> yesterday was my birthday .
a nice break from the reality of the job hunt roller coaster .
drinks and <UNK> and a movie ... dinner and jazz .
my husband is an angel and i really do n't know what i 'd do without him .
"the big studio finally called this morning , and the <UNK> said they 'd "" gone with someone else "" ."
"i wanted to ask why , what did i do"
", what did n't i do , was it something i said , was it something i did n't say ... ? !"
i thought i had a really good chance to at least get a second interview . darn .
chances are they took someone who was in the union already or maybe someone moved over from another department .
and now i 'm back at square <#> .
"i was on the phone with a friend the other day and he said that with my <UNK> , low voice , i should be in radio ."
and i do have a great phone - sex voice .
"that should be worth something , do n't you think ?"
"and now he 's a tv news guy , so stranger things have happened ."
i 'm starting to <UNK> my job resources and the <UNK> are all starting to look the same .
i have bills and expenses that do n't go on hold just because i 'm out of work .
it makes me feel as if i 've been cut <UNK> .
"i 've been blessed ( or cursed ) with a heavy - duty work <UNK> , and this situation is making me very uncomfortable ."
"maybe i 'm <UNK> today because it 's all gloomy and <UNK> , or maybe it 's that post - birthday crash ."
"i 'm still waiting to hear from the auto insurance claim people about my car -- i 've left messages , but you know how claims people are ."
"as far as i 'm concerned , that meant he was admitting to the accident being his fault ."
"i would have been fine with that , but he would n't return my phone calls , so i had no choice but to call his insurance company ."
lately all i seem to be doing is trying to cover my butt and defend myself against other people 's lies .
my husband seems to have caught the local summer flu bug -- probably from the gym .
"all that hot , <UNK> air and people sweating all over the equipment ."
i 'm <UNK> him with tea and soup and movies .
"as much as i hate it when he 's not feeling well , it 's actually a nice change from the job hunt ."
last week i went to visit a good friend who 's working as an <UNK> on a tv show .
i spent the afternoon chatting and i ran into a lot of crew people i knew .
it 's <UNK> on me that i should be visiting people and making ' the rounds ' rather than <UNK> on email and phone calls .
"i remember they had profit sharing , and that was pretty sweet ."
i also got a call on my cell while i was there for another interview with a camera company on wednesday .
"maybe things are finally starting to look up -- i still do n't have any solid offers , but at least i 'm starting to get more bites ."
i also sent in another submission to the big studio for something that i am way over - qualified for .
i hope i get a call from the <UNK> people .
i hope they can understand that i am willing to take a lower position just to get a job there .
"it might be kind of <UNK> after being in management , but i 'm not afraid to pay my <UNK> all over again ."
my husband is <UNK> and wanted to play <UNK> <UNK> on my <UNK> .
"i can never get past the first level on that , but it 's silly and makes me laugh ."
"my husband , on the other hand , is a computer game <UNK> ."
( i wonder if i can use this as evidence in the <UNK> of character and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ... ? )
i can at least keep up on the minimum payments on my bills without <UNK> .
"it 's a small load off of my mind , although it 's less than half of what i was earning before ."
"i am not having taxes taken out of my unemployment checks , either , so i really hope i find work soon ."
otherwise it will completely mess up my income taxes .
"more than they are already , that is ."
another good thing -- the auto accident <UNK> that the other guy 's ( the guy that hit me )
insurance company sent to take a look at the damage on my poor little car mailed me a copy of his report .
"it states in black and white that i was hit from behind square on , and therefore they are <UNK> and responsible for the <UNK> on my car ."
"not only that , but it <UNK> the guy 's false claim on my insurance that i was a fault and changed lanes into his car ."
it 's only the rear bumper and <UNK> ... and maybe the rear <UNK> .
"<UNK> only ; my <UNK> says there was no damage to the engine or the frame ( remember , old bugs carried the engine in the rear ) ."
... it 's been at the shop waiting for the insurance people to get off of their butts since the beginning of june .
"the accident was back in may , for pete 's sake ."
i 've been driving my baby for over <#> years and this is the very first time it 's been hit .
i 'm not ready to retire it just yet .
"after all this time , it 's almost like a pet , now ."
"there were no <UNK> before this , and no <UNK> , either ."
it got regular oil changes and tune - ups .
i 've had the same <UNK> for almost a decade .
"it has even been used as a "" picture vehicle "" on tv and in magazines ."
so i 'm not about to let it go .
it still has a few more <#> <#> miles left .
"<UNK> am tuesday , june <#> , <#> insomnia ."
we decided that i should sleep in the guest room tonight so as not to expose myself to my husband 's bug any more than i already have .
my immune system is n't what it used to be after having cancer .
although i have a lot of trouble sleeping <UNK> from him .
"i just realized that since i lost my job a month and a half ago , i 've <UNK> about <#> hours of sleep a night ."
"but then , neither is looking at an <UNK> screen this long ."
"he 's okay , but his beloved <UNK> may be a total loss ."
some lack - wit stopped in the middle of <UNK> traffic in the midst of making a left turn .
he just stopped -- claimed he heard a fire truck coming .
"my husband was in the <UNK> left lane , maybe <#> feet away going straight towards him , and had no time to <UNK> or stop ."
"i do n't know what kind of damage was done to the guy 's truck , but our <UNK> lost it 's entire left front end ."
the <UNK> was completely gone and god only knows where the bumper parts and license plate landed .
the hood was smashed up into the windshield and it was bleeding all sorts of <UNK> out of the huge <UNK> in its front end ...
i do n't know if it can be fixed .
what kind of idiot just stops in the middle of <UNK> traffic when he hears a <UNK> ?
"i mean , if you hear a <UNK> coming , make sure you stop in a safe place in your own damn lane , for heaven 's sake ."
"i lose my job , then my car gets smashed by some moron who ca n't <UNK> , and now this ."
mine is n't done yet -- although i should be able to get it monday ( i hope so -- i have another interview on tuesday morning ) .
and the insurance company of the loser that hit me is playing stupid games .
my actual repair costs came to $ <#> . and
"if i hear the word "" <UNK> "" <#> more time , i 'm going to lose it ."
"i no longer have faith in my resume -- i 've <UNK> down my educational references , because i think my masters is too <UNK> ."
the film industry is going through some weird times and right now none of the major <UNK> are hiring people in my field .
"but when i try and apply for jobs in other areas , that word comes up"
"i 've begun looking for jobs in non - industry fields , even though i 've spent the last <#> years working in film and tv ."
"i 'm still working on the <UNK> board <UNK> training , but it 's going to take some time before i feel accomplished enough to seek work there ."
and now we have no vehicles so i may have to put the training on hold until we 're mobile again .
we have begun discussing the possibility of moving away from los angeles to get out of the bad traffic and the <UNK> conditions .
maybe the northern california or oregon coast -- or <UNK> or seattle .
"the cost of living would be a lot less , and the slower pace might be good for us all the way around ."
"but that 's something that would require serious plans , not to mention a good nest egg to fund a move of that <UNK> ."
"we both agree that we absolutely do n't want to settle in la , but we 're really not ready to make the move ."
we wanted to wait at least until my husband had a script in production .
"in the meantime , we need to find a <UNK> spell to get rid of this run of bad luck ."
come on ... somebody just give me a damn job .
my husband 's bug has evolved into full - blown flu .
"he 's miserable , and today i felt terrible leaving him alone while i went to my interview at the camera company ."
but i have to say it was a great interview .
the place looked well - run and was <UNK> with activity .
"the hr manager was a doll , and we had a wonderful interview before she turned me over to the vp of marketing for my main meeting ."
the vp was a younger ( <UNK> 's ? ) man with a casual <UNK> and he was very <UNK> .
"he seemed genuinely impressed with my skills and experience , and we traded <UNK> about mutual <UNK> and amusing moments in <UNK> ."
"he reminded me of my old supervisor at the studio , who left for <UNK> <UNK> a few years ago ."
i really missed him when he left ; the guy they hired to replace him had no visible sense of humor and was not very pleasant to work for .
"the warehouse guys called him the "" little <UNK> . """
the vp told me right off the bat that i was <UNK> <UNK> for the position that was offered .
"i hate that -- i prefer to think of myself as "" <UNK> skilled "" or "" <UNK> talented . """
"<UNK> sounds like i 'm either trying to get a job that 's beneath me , or that they think they ca n't afford me ."
"after working at the studio for <#> years , they 'd be surprised how little i will work for ."
and i 'm of the firm belief that no honest work is ' beneath ' me -- it 's collecting unemployment that 's really <UNK> .
"i am getting to hate the word "" <UNK> . """
the camera company has not gotten back to me about my fantastic interview .
"i even sent the <UNK> "" thank you "" to the hr manager and the vp guy , but nothing ."
""" however , he did ask me out to lunch ."
i decided that i would expand my areas of knowledge and have signed up for <UNK> board <UNK> training .
i love being on set and dearly missed <UNK> with the crew and talent .
i am hoping that i will catch on quickly and can become a relative expert in short time .
my husband 's car is not a total loss .
"it apparently can be <UNK> , however it will take up to <#> weeks ."
"he 's currently renting a <UNK> echo , which is n't an awful car , but it feels very small to him ."
"i have to admit , he does look a little silly getting in and out of it ."
"it fits me just fine , but then , i 'm not <#> - <#> ."
all the smashed stuff is gone and they matched the paint perfectly .
i had a pretty good interview with a lighting company on july 1st .
"their insurance is an <UNK> plan , with no <UNK> or other options , and for a recovered cancer patient , that is completely <UNK> ."
"they wanted me to run half of the entire rental division of the whole company , plus be in charge of <UNK> management , as well as tech support ."
"heck , i could get a job at whole foods checking out groceries for the same money , better benefits , stock options , and a lot less stress ."
so i did the only thing i could -- i <UNK> a very careful counter - offer .
i made it very clear and <UNK> and to the point .
"they sent me back an email saying that they would "" discuss it with the owners "" and that 's the last i heard ."
i do n't expect to hear from them again .
and the icing on the cake was a letter from the unemployment office <UNK> me that the studio has filed an appeal for my claim .
this means that someone actually had to sit down and draft a letter saying that they want to <UNK> my benefits .
"the real <UNK> on this <#> is that if their appeal goes through , i have to pay back whatever benefit money i have already received ."
so now i have to wait for another letter <UNK> me when the hearing will be .
seems her leave of absence has gone longer than is allowed and so she is being <UNK> .
"he told her that i was fired for making inappropriate comments to customers and <UNK> , and that it was my third <UNK> , so they fired me ."
that 's funny ... that is n't what they told me when i was in the process of being fired .
"and by the way , the very fact that mr ."
corporate was discussing my <UNK> with someone outside of the situation is a very good reason for me to sue them .
ex - hr manager called me later in the evening and we talked for a little while .
we plan on having lunch and she said she could give me <UNK> on how to ace my unemployment hearing so i wo n't have any <UNK> in benefits .
"for the record , no customer or <UNK> has ever made any complaint whatsoever about me ."
"the only "" attitude issues "" in my employee records are from the fat creep of an it manager that got me fired in the first place ."
"in fact , every single <UNK> i have ever received from that company was related to a complaint he made ."
"oh , i really am beginning to hate those people ."
i think i need to start this legal ball rolling before it gets too late .
please yesterday i received the notice for my unemployment hearing .
"it 's at the end of the month , and i am very nervous about it ."
"i 've never been fired before , so i really do n't know what to expect or what kind of questions they 'll ask ."
"i also do n't know which story the studio will tell them , so i do n't know which set of their lies i need to be prepared for ."
all i can do is tell the truth and do my best to stay calm and <UNK> .
my shorts really ca n't hold any more .
i 'm guessing that they re - <UNK> the <UNK> money that was <UNK> up when i was fired .
it 's about time -- those guys worked far too hard to have to go for <#> years without even a cost - of - living increase .
i should know ; i went through it right along with them . also yesterday
i got a surprise in my email ... the lighting company that sent me the pathetic offer
"thank you but we 've decided to go in a different direction for that department . """
"like i said before , cheap people suck ."
my husband 's car could n't be saved after all .
"the <UNK> found all sorts of damage when he got into it -- the <UNK> brake system was destroyed , and he said the <UNK> were bent ."
the leather seats were heated and it had a <UNK> <UNK> .
"of course , we 'll have to buy something used , but we 're all right with that ."
his rear license plate and frame came in the mail today .
that 's all we have left of his car .
"the front plate was lost in the accident , and we cleaned out all of his personal items before it was <UNK> from our driveway ."
"i know it 's silly to become emotionally attached to a car , but we 're both sad ."
i 'll make sure and keep that in mind when i 'm <UNK> my next ( perhaps last ) unemployment check . and
"why is a major entertainment industry union office keeping such a bare - bones staff , anyway ?"
i will bet dollars to <UNK> that those <#> <UNK> people are all stressed up all the time .
"is it me , or are all <UNK> getting to be that way lately ?"
but the idea of having to go to a big warehouse - type room where other people are sweating and <UNK> makes my skin crawl .
the only thing i like about working out is the shower when it 's all over .
"i like knowing that the hot water at the gym will never , ever run out and i can take my sweet time conditioning my hair ."
i admit it -- i 'm generally a sit - at - the - desk kind of person .
"it has since then slowed considerably , and i have , to my horror , began developing the fat <UNK> that my grandmother displayed ."
"while <UNK> myself on the treadmill today , i was reading a magazine that appears to be a <UNK> for the pre - and <UNK> - <UNK> set ."
"so on a <UNK> , i picked up a copy of this new mag ."
"since i 'm writing anyway , i 'm well - educated , and i have tons of time on my hands , why could n't i do that ?"
it 's just me <UNK> off my random thoughts and daily <UNK> as an attempt to get them out so i can sleep at night .
"i always <UNK> in creative writing when i was in school , and i even <UNK> at journalism when i was in college ."
"ok , it did n't pay or anything , but apparently there were people out there who were interested in what i had to say ."
i wo n't give up the search for a job in the entertainment business .
"it 's what i 've done for the past <#> years , and i like it too much to just switch careers ."
nobody tips a nasty bartender <#> days until my unemployment hearing .
"i 'm not sleeping again and when i do sleep , i wake up several times during the night in a cold sweat , <UNK> ."
the stress from the past few months is taking a toll -- my hair has begun to fall out and i 'm not even on <UNK> this time .
"i would definitely need a better wardrobe , though ."
it 's just an excuse to go shopping .
i have also started looking at job <UNK> that are not in the film industry .
"after spending the last <#> years on movie and television stages , the thought of going into another field scares the heck out of me . and"
"truth to tell , i simply do n't have an interest in banking or the hotel business ."
i suppose i could tend bar while i look for a film industry position .
but i 'm afraid that i would end up out of the loop and become bitter and that could cut into my tips .
also today i went through a <UNK> list of all the commercial production companies i could find .
"out of the <#> companies in the la area , i found about <#> of them with which i have personally done business ."
"it was terribly time consuming , but i figured it could n't hurt and it might at least open up a dialogue with these people ."
"if anything , they might contact me out of curiosity to ask me what happened ."
"even if i get some <UNK> work , it will get me back into the regular swing of things and hopefully lead to something more permanent ."
"i will try doing this with tv and motion picture production companies next , although getting contact information is more difficult than with commercial companies ."
"this is largely due to the fact that many companies are created specifically for a single film or tv show , so there are literally thousands of them ."
"the hard part is trying to figure out with which major studio or larger production company they are <UNK> , if any ."
"many of them were created by tv and film actors , and so trying to find a <UNK> number or email address is pretty tricky ."
"i have heard that sometimes they will call you simply because they have seen your name so many times , they think you 're "" somebody "" ."
it 's ridiculous that i have to jump through so many <UNK> just to get a job .
no wonder republicans believe what they see on fox news .
"trade with cuba is wrong because the country is communist , but trade with china and vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony ."
"a woman ca n't be trusted with decisions about her own body , but multi - national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without <UNK> ."
"jesus loves you , and shares your hatred of homosexuals and hillary clinton ."
the best way to improve military <UNK> is to praise the troops in speeches while <UNK> veterans ' benefits and combat pay .
"if condoms are kept out of schools , <UNK> wo n't have sex ."
providing health care to all iraqis is sound policy .
providing health care to all americans is <UNK> .
<UNK> and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart .
"global warming and tobacco 's link to cancer are junk science , but <UNK> should be taught in schools ."
a president lying about an <UNK> affair is a <UNK> offense .
a president lying to <UNK> support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy .
"government should limit itself to the powers named in the constitution , which include <UNK> gay marriages and <UNK> the internet ."
"the public has a right to know about hillary 's <UNK> <UNK> , but george bush 's cocaine conviction is none of our business ."
"being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime , unless you 're a conservative radio host ."

"you support states ' rights , which means attorney general john <UNK> can tell states what local voter <UNK> they have the right to adopt ."
"what bill clinton did in the <UNK> is of vital national interest , but what bush did in the ' 80s is irrelevant ."

the following article was supposed to run in usa today today .
but they asked for a few changes before publishing it . perhaps like having the article written by someone else who is reasonable ?
my allies are the ones wearing crosses or american flags .
the people sporting shirts <UNK> with the ' f - word ' are my opponents .
"also , as always , the pretty girls and cops are on my side , most of them barely able to <UNK> their eye - rolling ."
so it 's a real mystery why cops would n't like democrats .
"as for the pretty girls , i can only guess that it 's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the <UNK> ."
"plus , it 's no fun riding around in those <UNK> little <UNK> cars ."
"apparently , the nuts at the democratic national convention are going to be put in <UNK> outside the convention hall ."
"sadly , they wo n't be fighting to the death as is done in <UNK> ."
"they 're calling this the "" <UNK> 's area , "" although i suppose a better name would be the "" truth - free zone . """
"i 'd say the actual policy is only <UNK> nuts get the <UNK> , but little dennis <UNK> is speaking at the convention , too ."
"so it must be <UNK> for "" nuts who have not run for president as serious candidates for the democratic party . """
we 'll even let him have an hour or so of preparation before we open up .
"for <#> years , the democrats would n't let jimmy carter within <#> miles of a convention <UNK> ."
the fact that carter is now their most respectable speaker tells you where that party is today .
maybe they just want to remind americans who got us into this middle east mess in the first place .
"we 've got millions of <UNK> muslims trying to <UNK> americans while shouting "" allah <UNK> ! """
"yeah , let 's turn the nation over to these guys ."
"with any luck , gore will <UNK> his speech comparing republicans to nazis ."
in case you were wondering where all those glowing articles about bush were coming from .
"then again , with his <UNK> for earth tones in a man 's wardrobe , maybe gore 's references to "" brown shirts "" was intended as a compliment ."
"the new york times responded with an article <UNK> "" both "" republicans and democrats for using nazi <UNK> ."
"democrats call republicans nazis , the republicans quote the democrats calling republicans nazis and "" both "" are using nazi <UNK> ."
( it 's a cycle of violence ! )
the nuts in the <UNK> are virtual <UNK> <UNK> compared to the official speakers at the democratic convention .
"support the troops , "" the signs say , "" bring them home ."
i love <UNK> at the national <UNK> of the arts funding <UNK> <UNK> in urine so much –
i love public school teachers <UNK> any mention of god and <UNK> christmas songs so much –
i think they should go home . walking back from the convention site
", i chatted with a normal <UNK> for several blocks – who must have identified me through our <UNK> system of signals ."
"then he <UNK> himself and said he votes for the "" american . """
"i 'd say i love all these democrats in boston so much i want them to go home , but i do n't ."
i want americans to get a good long look at the french party and keep the <#> - <#> challenge in mind .
"now , this may come off as pretty <UNK> ."
here 's the scene : boston - <UNK> center .
center of the democratic party 's <#> convention .
we already know what the democratic platform is .
we know who the candidates for president and vice president for the party will be .
it 's really unlikely that there will be any surprises at all .
and yet ... the major news networks are still covering it as if it were the <#> 's .
could it be that a group will stage a last minute <UNK> to get hillary on the ticket ?
or maybe howard dean will indulge the audience with another of his <UNK> - out - of - context screams ?
do we turn in to see the republican response as each day <UNK> ?
"no , <UNK> the other party <UNK> low at this time ."
"now , this could be anything almost in the boston area ."
and that brings me to my conspiracy theory of the day .
if you 're karl <UNK> and george bush you want to maintain the illusion of keeping the tradition of laying low during this convention .
"a nation of <UNK> - like tv viewers who tune in as much , if not more , to see the big accident rather than the race ."
"bill <UNK> - yes , the same guy who used to be on some <UNK> <UNK> tv show - hosts his own , well <UNK> tv <UNK> ."
if you do n't know about it go to <UNK> or <UNK> and read .
"fox news channel has fired a <UNK> in a campaign of <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> aimed <UNK> at teresa heinz kerry , the democratic candidate 's wife !"
"<UNK> 's guest , tom <UNK> , <UNK> mrs ."
"kerry of secretly funding a group of radical <UNK> , using the heinz <UNK> as her "" cover "" ."
"true to form , no <#> was there to argue mrs ."
"right wing bloggers have been <UNK> this story all around the net for a long time , but <UNK> has now given it the fox seal of approval ."
john kerry 's been put on notice : your wife is fair game .
let 's turn the tables on fox news and the right wing !
bill <UNK> frequently uses the power of his show to encourage his viewers to call various <UNK> and demand that they fire <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> of .
below you will find a list of the national <UNK> who bought time during <UNK> 's july 20th show .
edwards deserve the same respect and courtesy that has consistently been <UNK> to mrs .
"when you 're done , copy the list below and e - mail it to your friends ."

i 've noticed that lately the number of people and groups being <UNK> as anti - american has grown significantly .
she calls bush some choice names during a private fund - <UNK> and she gets fired as a spokesman for <UNK> .
the company line is they do n't want that kind of controversy .
well because she made the mistake of <UNK> her right to free speech .
it 's no longer enough to <UNK> disagree .
the right - wing demands blood ! and what about linda <UNK> ?
in las vegas ( sin - city ) of all places she spoke her mind at a casino .
"and she was <UNK> out of the hotel , <#> of the <UNK> <UNK> ( while half cheered ) ."
the <UNK> media again made this out to be more than it was .
all those <UNK> elite - <UNK> in hollywood !
i guess arnold <UNK> gave up his hollywood title when he became a republican governor ?
how dare they do that is a time of war !
as blogs seem to be all the rage i thought i 'd look into creating my own .
a new feature is the presence of so many <UNK> - wing sites and news agencies that go beyond saying <#> side is more patriotic than the other .
the new trend is to openly question the patriotism of the other and <UNK> them of <UNK> america 's enemies if they vote against the current administration .
these are all things that seem to be much more <UNK> this year than in years past .
is anyone really seeking to give aid and comfort to the enemy simply because they say that they would run things differently ?
i ca n't help but think that unless theres a change we will spiral down a very dangerous road that is more like <#> than anyone could have imagined .
my next post i 'll take a look at what i perceive to be the difference between the democrats and the <UNK> .
"nowadays is an <UNK> that means "" at the present time "" or "" these days ."
""" it is used primarily to show contrast between a period , state or situation in the present that is different from the past ."
most often it follows the use of used to and the <UNK> but .
"for example : people used to dress up to go to the theater , but nowadays no <#> hardly does ."
"he used to come to work early every day , but nowadays he is always late ."
this is not to be confused with the use of now .
"for instance : my favorite food used to be italian , but now it is japanese ."
"last year i wanted to be a doctor , but now i want to be lawyer ."
"in conclusion , nowadays nowadays is not used very often , so you are better off not using it all the time ."
"when i was a kid , i used to come home from school feeling very tired and <UNK> ."
my mom would try to have a conversation with me and it would go something like this : <UNK> are you ?
"although the word fine is a perfectly good description of how <#> feels , it really does n't express a lot of information ."
try to get into the habit of automatically telling someone how you really feel or just talk about what is going on .
look at the following : <UNK> is it going ?
or - how you 're doing ?
"<UNK> , not too well . i just got into a big fight with my boss ."
i 'm just trying to figure out where i want to go for vacation next month .
"to conclude , americans are actually a very friendly bunch ."
you just need to learn how to access communication with a few simple <UNK> .
"there are some words in english that have similar <UNK> in <UNK> ; however , they have different meanings ."
it means to plan or have in mind an objective or goal .
i intend on making lots of money when i graduate from medical school .
there is also the verb to pretend .
"it means to <UNK> , or make believe ."
the children were pretending to be <UNK> and indians .
"when i get up in the morning , i have trouble seeing ."
"so , i have to put them in before i can do anything ."
some people wear black socks with gym shoes .
we use the <UNK> towards to show the direction in which the subject is going .
"this is different than to , in which the direction is not so important as to the place that the subject is going ."
for example : i 'm going to the <UNK> to buy a magazine .
( what is important is the destination : <UNK> )
i was walking towards the supermarket when i bumped into an old friend .
"( of course , the destination heaven is important , but if she did n't really die , then she never made it ! )"
body wrap ( <UNK> ) <#> : a body treatment involving the application of usually <UNK> or <UNK> followed by a wrapping of the body with a sheet <#> .
<UNK> ( <UNK> ) <UNK> <#> : a dessert <UNK> of a layer of fruit ( as <UNK> ) topped with <UNK> and baked <#> .
<UNK> ( <UNK> ) <#> : a short - lived <UNK> element produced <UNK> element table ( also : ds : <UNK> symbol for <UNK> ) <#> .
<UNK> ( <UNK> ) : high - performance liquid <UNK> <#> .

<#> : a plastic fabric made to look like leather <#> .
s <UNK> ( <UNK> ) : senate resolution <#> .
<UNK> ( <UNK> ) <#> : the <UNK> of teenagers by producers of teen - oriented films <#> .
"sometimes , the same word in <UNK> will have <#> or more different words in english ."
"for example , take the word <UNK> ."
this can mean either shadow or shade .
"shadow refers to the specific outline that a person , object , or thing creates when in front of the sun or other bright light source ."
"the children were playing , jumping on each other 's shadows ."
jamie followed his mother around all day like a shadow .
"the sun <UNK> through the leaves , casting shadows on the lawn ."
"on the other hand , shade refers to a slight darkness caused by something blocking the direct light from the sun , usually an <UNK> area ."
"we did n't want to sit in the sun , so we asked for a table in the shade ."
the children played under the shade of a lar <UNK> beach umbrella .
a shady person is someone who is <UNK> or does illegal things .
i had a little time to take a look at other 's blogs .
i 'm not in search of the perfect mate .
i am nowhere near as profound as my fellow bloggers .
"it used to be "" will it hurt or cost money ? """
but i am a strong believer that everything happens for a reason .
buying a computer led to my move to <UNK> .
getting layed off led to my job and <UNK> in college .
"well , had an appointment with a new <UNK> , since we switched <UNK> and therefore had to find a new doctor ."
"it bugs me that western doctors treat <UNK> issues as medical issues -- such as "" sleeping through the night . """
"worldwide , it is normal for kids not to sleep straight through the night until they are <#> or so ."
"i think this is completely normal , doc seemed to expect her to sleep straight through <#> hours <UNK> ."
this is ridiculous -- what adult sleeps straight through the night without waking at least once ? ! and who cares anyway ?
we love our sleeping arrangement and everyone is happy and rested in the morning .
so who cares if she wakes up briefly once or twice ?
is it even the doctor 's business to ask that question ?
"also , she seemed <UNK> that i 'll let <UNK> self - <UNK> ( which , by the way , she appears to be doing right now ) ."
"i received no encouragement for nursing her for as long as she wants ... which is the <UNK> , best thing ."
i wish <UNK> would read the research and learn about what goes on outside their precious western medicine <UNK> .
"when it comes to <UNK> and <UNK> , i have yet for a doctor or nurse to tell me any correct piece of information ."
"since i learnt a lot about these issues while working on my thesis <UNK> , i am always way more informed than they are ."
"well , they 're not , and i will continue the search for a <UNK> who has actually taken the time to read some research ."
for the past few days she has only wanted to nurse <#> times in a <#> hour period .
"she does n't nurse in the night anymore -- all of this is completely her own doing , i have never pushed or refused her ."
"she is now deciding , of her own little free will , that she has had enough of nursing ."
"i feel very happy that this is <UNK> in such a natural , peaceful way ."
fatigue -- i am so tired ! ! ! ! ! !
i am eating way too much and feeling <UNK> much of the time .
i am mom to a <#> month old gorgeous girl and wife to a young professor at mit .
"i am technically still a graduate student at harvard , though i just began a year leave of absence so that i can solely concentrate on my family ."
my daughter has been by my side throughout the master 's portion of the harvard program -- this break comes before i begin the <UNK> .
portion ( if i go back after the birth of my second child ) .
"this is a high - risk pregnancy , since i developed an extensive blood <UNK> ( deep vein <UNK> ) during the third <UNK> of my first pregnancy ."
this is freaking hilarious ( i 'm <UNK> so big it hurts my face - really ) !
"matt is a bit prone to "" telling tales "" that grow with the telling ."
my bedroom has a sliding glass door and in the summer we keep that door open about <#> inches .
"however , there is no screen on the <UNK> ."
"sucks , i know , but you do what you can to keep cool air <UNK> ."
"well , it does n't take a brain surgeon to figure out that things that live outside may want to experience life inside ... like tourists ."
"usually it is spiders , <UNK> flies and the occasional <UNK> ."
the landlord owns a <UNK> control company and he <UNK> regularly so the <UNK> are kept to a minimum .
"anyway , it was no surprise when matt again saw the mouse , this time in the kitchen ."
he watched as it ran from under the stove to a space under the <UNK> .
"he pulled out the <UNK> and sure enough , here was the mouse <UNK> in the corner ."
"i , amused by this display of <UNK> in the face of such a <UNK> opponent , sat <UNK> <UNK> from my <UNK> on the couch ."
"hey , i may be an <UNK> <UNK> , but with <#> men in the house , <UNK> <UNK> is n't my worry ."
eric got the <UNK> to encourage the <UNK> to <UNK> toward our <UNK> out the front door .
"well , the mouse moved - fast - <UNK> toward the front room ."
the boys <UNK> <UNK> and yelled ( war cries ? screams of <UNK> ? ) and the mouse changed direction - right at me .
"if i had thought the previous activity was <UNK> to watch , what happened next was shocking in it 's intensity ."
eric began tearing the front room apart in order to leave no place to hide for the <UNK> <UNK> of satan .
"today 's newspaper was left to the winds of fate as it was <UNK> through the living room , coming <UNK> close to the ceiling fan ."
books and toys the kids had refused to put away were promptly <UNK> and moved .
eric turned the couch over and the mouse made a break for the entertainment center ( again ) .
then back under the <UNK> holding all of our <UNK> tapes and cd 's .
"this being too much excitement for me , and since this is a saturday and only 10:30 a.m. , i 'm still in my <UNK> ..."
i decided to head to my room and get dressed for the hunt .
"all of the doors along the hallway are shut to keep mice out , so i shut my bedroom door , and behind me , the hunt continues ."
"the activity moves toward me , and i hear eric tell not to open the door because the mouse is pressed against it ."
eric takes everything out of the closet and blocks the hole .
"i find more holes in my jeans that desperately need <UNK> , all the while wondering how much will actually get done ."
matt <UNK> into my bedroom yelling the he 's seen the mouse run from his closet .
"their closet is piled with false proof that their room is "" cleaned "" ."
eric comes in a witnesses said mouse run behind the boys ' computer desk .
right now the boys are cleaning ( really ! ) their room in an attempt to flush the mouse out .
eric has gone to the hardware store to buy <UNK> .
"i 'm in my office with the door <UNK> to half - ounce <UNK> of chewing destruction , typing in my blog ."
"after all , my star wars action figure collection is directly threatened !"
"of course , there may be more than <#> mouse ..."
"i actually got dressed at a reasonable time , i read my paper and got out and got the errands done i needed to do ."
i 'm <UNK> that this <#> business i need to shop at is never opened !
you 'd think that if you have enough invested with a store front to actually need to stay open on occasion .
i also talked to the editor of the <UNK> .
"i used to be a semi - <UNK> for them , the column being urllink "" web <UNK> "" , or stories from the internet ."
"unfortunately , that does n't seem to hold any water with this guy ."
"he told me to go ahead , and in the vein of j. <UNK> <UNK> , i should take that as a <UNK> positive , or not ."
"i do have to re - write the piece to make no mention of the <UNK> , who just released her newly published first book ."
it was kind of a <UNK> point for the article .
"oh , and i updated the urllink beauty with attitude "" news "" page ."
"hell , it 's done and that 's what matters ."
today i stopped by the <UNK> to find out more information about what 's going to happen next week .
"most of the information is still <UNK> , but that 's to be expected from the military ."
"i think they should write down information in invisible ink , for all the changes that come along ."
i 'm also <UNK> all my gear according to the packing list i received from the company .
"tomorrow is the <UNK> , so most of my family should be here ."
"i doubt if i 'll have a chance to post for a few days , but hopefully i 'll be able to write something down early next week ."
"well , here it is ... just a few more days until i report to the unit for <UNK> ."
"it 's been a crazy week so far , and i 've still got so much more to do ."
"<UNK> all my gear in my <UNK> bags , put all my junk in storage <UNK> to take out to mom 's house ..."
"this saturday , my aunt and uncle are planning to have a going - away <UNK> at the house for me ."
"of course , the local relatives will be here for it , but i 'm going to have to miss the family reunion on sunday ."
maybe some of my other relatives will head over to the company going - away ceremony before they head home .
"the former <UNK> asked me to sing "" the star - <UNK> banner "" at the ceremony ..."
i 'm honored that they chose me to do it .
hopefully i 'll have more opportunities to post to this blog during the time i 'm on <UNK> .
"i 'll try to send pictures home , or at least post them on here so my friends and family can see what i 'm going through ."
maybe the next <#> months will go by quick .

democrats like you ... get into government to help people .
"the right - wing <UNK> do n't think government can do much to improve human nature , but they do like power ."
"and since you 're president , they both get power the same way , by hurting you ."

"i 'm sure we 're all absorbed in the democratic national convention , but i wanted to share an observation about the whole "" e - voting "" issue ."

( these machines are to be used in florida ...
so much for trust and/or a fair election ! )
<UNK> has also said that it is n't possible or practical to design the machines so they will produce a paper <UNK> trail .
"i <UNK> my card , entered my code , selected withdraw , entered the amount ."
"just like that , money came out of the machine ."
"then , it asked me if i would like to make another <UNK> ."
"i said no , and it asked me if i wanted a <UNK> ."

could it be because they do n't want them to ? ?
"their objective , yet positive , coverage of john kerry is <UNK> ..."

"a passage from bob <UNK> 's recent book quotes bush as saying , "" i do not need to explain why i say things ."
that 's the interesting thing about being the president .
"maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something , but i do n't feel like i owe anybody an explanation . """
"well , that just about puts the bow on that arrogant package ."
check in again for my <UNK> on <UNK> and his miserable aids policy .
"all i 'll say now is , "" liar , liar , pants on fire ! """
"<UNK> , and she is having a difficult time trying to figure out why bush appeals to so many people ."
"she points out that kerry is engaged in a lot of activities that most people would normally find pretty cool -- <UNK> , hockey , electric guitar ."
"yet , kerry is the <#> <UNK> for being a <UNK> ."
i think we all know who the real <UNK> is .
"this <UNK> would normally make sense , as last quarters <UNK> was <#> % ."
"of course , the <UNK> came out a few hours after they announced that this quarters <UNK> is <#> % ."
"on top of that , they project that the deficit is a record $ <#> <#> , an increase of $ <#> <#> over last year 's <UNK> ."
and they are spinning this as a positive !
"according to the bush admin , the original <UNK> was for a deficit of $ <#> <#> !"
"so , although the deficit is the worst it has ever been , they are proud of themselves because it could have been worse ! !"
"in his acceptance speech last night , john kerry said : """
they say this is the best economy we 've ever had .
and they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a <UNK> .
"well , here is our answer : there is nothing more <UNK> than saying america ca n't do better . "" this is exactly what he was referring to ."
the bush administration gives us a record deficit and then attempts to tell us that we ca n't do better .
"the new campaign motto for president bush is the <UNK> weak "" we 're turning the corner ."
"president , i know what 's around that corner ."
it 's a pretty <UNK> part of town .
"i , personally , would like to go back and get on the <UNK> ."
"according to the urllink associated press , george bush has a "" narrow "" lead over kerry in the electoral votes ."
"my own tracking poll shows a quite different result , with kerry leading bush <#> to <#> ."
"bush actually went down <#> points today due to <UNK> 's poll of west virginia , which is now too close to call . not"
urllink <UNK> just released their <UNK> state polls .
"this must be the most obvious question on earth , but <UNK> like [ joe ] <UNK> aren’t going to raise it ."
"lazy , <UNK> and deeply <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> produce approved press corps scripts ."

"yes , president bush <UNK> a war , then worked to defeat the spending bill that would have supported the troops !"
"there was , of course , nothing wrong with that conduct ; bush <UNK> a different form of the bill , and he was working to pass it ."
"there was never a <UNK> a <UNK> the troops weren’t going to be funded . "" indeed ."
"well , we end up with congress <UNK> the president ."
"first the <UNK> branch <UNK> the president , then the <UNK> branch picks the president ."
"the only option after that would be the executive branch picking the president -- or , as i like to call it , a <UNK> ."
"only <#> poll out today , and that is for new jersey ."
""" there have been previous polls in new jersey , conducted by both <UNK> and <UNK> university ."
"<UNK> <UNK> new jersey in may , and found kerry leading bush <UNK> % with a <#> % <UNK> ."
<UNK> followed <#> weeks later and found kerry leading bush by <#> points .
"<UNK> 's june poll showed bush losing <#> points , giving kerry a <#> point lead ( <UNK> % ) ."
"<UNK> 's june poll showed kerry remaining steady , with bush picking up <#> points ( giving kerry a ten point <UNK> % lead ) ."
"public mind 's thesis is that kerry needs to give voters a reason to vote for him , rather than vote against bush ."
this leaves <UNK> % of the voters without a decision .
"those who have already chosen kerry seem to be sticking with him , whereas bush is gaining and losing support ."
this will be his best opportunity to convert some of the <UNK> voters .
only <#> polls out today : kentucky and north carolina .
"no change in the <UNK> , kerry still leads <#> to <#> ."
"bush <UNK> his lead in north carolina , and some have pointed out that this spells trouble for edwards since it is his home state ."
"these states combined have a total of <#> votes , which are enough to give either candidate the necessary <#> votes ."
"ohio in the latest poll is slightly bush ( <UNK> % with a <#> % <UNK> ) , the others are all within the <UNK> ."
"as the kerry <UNK> point out , it was kerry himself who said this : “ i’m an <UNK> ."
i’d like to see our troops <UNK> through the world only at the <UNK> of the united nations .
no country will have a <UNK> over what we need to do to protect ourselves .
here 's where the <UNK> enters into the picture .
"<UNK> is a very effective tool to control the masses , as <UNK> pointed out ."
"new polls out for a lot of states : florida , <UNK> , ohio , among others ."
"kerry still leads for polls that lie outside the <UNK> , <#> to <#> ."
"in states where the polls lie <UNK> % points , kerry leads <#> to <#> ."
"ignoring the <UNK> entirely , kerry leads <#> to <#> ."
taking a day off after traveling all weekend for a party .
i will update the electoral vote tracking poll tomorrow ( i believe some new polls came out over the weekend ) .
listened to most of the yankees - red sox series on <UNK> am radio this weekend while driving - that must have been <#> heck of a series .
"a few new polls came out today : california , florida , new <UNK> , ohio and pennsylvania ."
"ignoring the <UNK> altogether , kerry leads <#> - <#> ."
today president bush is out urllink <UNK> the african - american vote .
"the thesis of his address is found in this statement : "" does the democrat party take african - american voters for granted ?"
i know plenty of politicians assume they have your vote .
"but did they earn it , and do they deserve it ? """
did the democrats earn the african - american vote ?
do they continue to deserve the support of the african - american community ?
"bush 's speech to the urban league can be <UNK> down to its essence -- "" you do n't know what 's good for you ."
"we do , so you should listen to us . """
is n't it about time we let african - americans make their own decisions ?
"here is the urllink report in html , courtesy of urllink <UNK> ."
"you can also view the urllink <UNK> of the report , courtesy of the washington post ."
"although , the "" washington <UNK> "" kind of has a ring to it ."
it is the <UNK> anniversary of washington 's victory in the <#> world series .
"the urllink washington post is doing a great series on that season , i highly recommend it"
"we 've all heard the conspiracy theories as to how this is going to happen -- <UNK> elections , <UNK> voting machines , etc ."
"in doing my electoral vote tracking poll , i began to wonder what would happen if no <#> candidate got a majority of the electoral vote ."
i looked at state representation by party and this is the quick breakdown that i found .
"republicans have majority representation in <#> states , and democrats in <#> ."
that leaves <#> states that do not have a <UNK> majority .
a candidate would need <#> votes to become president .
"now , this is where i begin to get a little <UNK> on election law ."
the house would have to decide which candidate is the winner if neither candidate gets a majority .
<#> way that would happen is if a third candidate <UNK> a state .
"now , suppose a state refuses to submit their poll results to congress in time for the votes to be counted ."
"say , a state like florida with its <#> electoral votes ."
"i have a feeling that this would also go to the supreme court , and we 'd end up with another <#> - <#> vote ."
"i have , purely for the sake of curiosity , created an excel <UNK> which i am using to track the various state presidential polls ."
i will be posting the results hopefully on a daily basis .
"as of today , kerry leads bush <#> - <#> ."
there are <#> votes in states where the <#> candidates <UNK> within the <UNK> .
"in states where the candidate has a <UNK> lead in the polls , bush leads <#> - <#> ."
"if you do not take <UNK> into consideration , kerry leads <#> - <#> , which is still shy of the <#> electoral votes needed to win the election ."
update : i went in and <UNK> the ohio results with the strategic vision poll ( which is a republican <UNK> group ) .
"they give ohio to bush , which changes the results to <#> - <#> within the <UNK> ."
"# <UNK> print "" hello , <UNK> "" ;"
"some slight movement today , following the release of polls for colorado , <UNK> and pennsylvania ."
"bush lost <#> <UNK> overall , giving kerry a <#> to <#> lead ."
yet another person prevented from entering a <UNK> event because they urllink support the other candidate .
"i thought america was a place where we could all be different , and at the same time , remain american ?"
"research <#> 's poll of north carolina has put that state into a <UNK> tie , moving <#> <UNK> from bush to the "" at - large "" pool ."
kerry now leads <#> to <#> .
this marks a <#> point drop for bush in the last <#> days .
kerry has been at <#> <UNK> for eleven consecutive days now .
"<UNK> 's poll for ohio came out today , and the race is a <UNK> tie ."
bush was last at <#> <UNK> on <#> .
kerry has remained at <#> <UNK> since <#> .
there are still <#> <UNK> at large -- bush needs <#> of them to have the majority .
"it will be interesting to track the <UNK> after the gop convention , to see if bush will have the same bounce that kerry did ."
... was urllink radiohead ... in my <UNK> at least .
"i love this band , they 're <#> of my most favorite among the many ."
i first saw this blog thing when i joined the urllink sun star news forum some time back in june .
i came across the blog of <#> of the members and i thought this was a pretty cool concept .
"ok , since i 'm still trapped in the radiohead mood , i decided to pick "" <UNK> <UNK> alien "" as my blog <UNK> ."
"if you want to find some good blog reading , you 're in the wrong blogspot ."
there is no other special or meaningful reasons why so do n't ask and that is that .
"i live in a town where you ca n't smell a thing , you watch your feet for cracks in the pavement . up"
"they 're all <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"i wish that they 'd sweep down in a country lane , late at night when i 'm driving ."
"take me on board their beautiful ship , show me the world as i 'd love to see it ."
"i 'd tell all my friends but they 'd never believe me , they 'd think that i 'd finally lost it completely ."
i 'd show them the stars and the meaning of life .
"but i 'd be alright , alright , i 'd be alright , i 'm alright ."
"i 'm just <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
""" it deals with alien <UNK> and <UNK> from <#> incidents in <UNK> 's life ."
he stepped out of the car and at that moment began thinking about alien <UNK> .
first time i saw this blog thing was over a month ago and have been thinking of starting a little journal for myself .
a lot of stuff have been swirling around my head these past few months .
"i 'll be on the <UNK> for this evil "" <UNK> <UNK> "" though ."
i have a tendency to put the fire out just when i get it started .
we 'll see how long i can keep this <UNK> ' .
"( <UNK> <UNK> is a filipino <UNK> translated as something that is not permanent , usually <UNK> a behavior or action not meant to last )"
"... and more productive , a pig in a cage on <UNK> ."
"last weekend was great . started with another hike to keep this old body <UNK> , <UNK> , happier ."
"on saturday morning <#> am , we headed on out to urllink <UNK> to meet up with friends from work ."
<#> friend actually <UNK> because she needed to sleep in after a hot date friday night .
"<UNK> , i 'm sure that was more exciting than the hike ."
the plan was to drive down to urllink point <UNK> national <UNK> in <UNK> this time - lesson learned after the last hike .
"the group lost <#> people the last time - it was <UNK> and the friend who <UNK> ( haha , it figures ) ."
it took us <#> minutes or so to get to the park .
we decided to take the bear valley trail which was pretty easy .
this trail took us to the coast about <#> miles ( <#> km ) to <UNK> rock .
i was extra excited this hike because my boyfriend <UNK> finally get to go ( after months of <UNK> ) .
he almost always have this lame excuse not to go because of work or have to go see his mum and sis as our friend jay would say .
"i ca n't blame him though , he has a wonderful family ( almost just like mine , tee hee ) ."
"but hey , how many people do you know actually loves to hang - out with the fam every week ?"
i bet ya can still count 'em with your fingers if you 're lucky and with your toes too maybe .
most people i know always seem to stay away from their fam .
"i did , but that 's a different story morning glory ."
i like <UNK> that work you up to sweating like a pig sometimes .
i do n't mind little hills and steep upgrade as long as you get a break once in a while .
it 's also nice to see plants and trees i 've never seen back home .
i like it when they just cover the ground - probably what a <UNK> farm would look like i thought .
"growing up in the <UNK> , <#> will find the usual banana trees , coconut trees or <UNK> ."
"and the "" no or low humidity "" aspect always makes a world of difference ."
we saw an occasional deer family <UNK> around the bushes .
"this <#> was quite brave , popping his head out for minutes at a time ... interesting ."
i 've always seen the holes on the ground but never the creature underneath .
urllink the trail ended on <UNK> rock <UNK> the pacific ocean .
it was a beautiful scenery and a perfect spot for our picnic lunch .
after working out an appetite and now the belly is full ... and you can hear the sound of the ocean on the background and the waves crashing below ...
"i should have brought a <UNK> , <UNK> sighed ."
the thought of hiking back another hour and a half seemed the least exciting .
urllink here 's looking down the cliff urllink <UNK> rock it was really not that bad .
the hike back offered a sort of different view and scenery almost .
i have to walk extra fast this time for a pee break .
it 's <#> of the <UNK> with outdoor activities especially if you 're a girl .
the perfect bush to hide seems always hard to find .
by the time we were done <UNK> was aching for some hot bath and massage .
i 'm sure i ai n't getting any this time
urllink we finally got back home around <#> pm .
"it was hot in urllink santa <UNK> , we hit the <#> 's ( <#> c ) this weekend ."
we decided to kick back a little bit and planned to see a movie later .
the place we 're renting right now does not have an <UNK> so the movie theatre is the next best place to hang - out on hot summer days .
"boy , did she have some exciting stories to tell !"
"he was quite a young dad when he had <UNK> , he was <#> ."
<UNK> just turned <#> a couple of months ago .
"she is such an adorable , cutest , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> blonde i have ever met ."
"anyway , she and her friends went out to see an apparently "" <UNK> modern punk rock <UNK> show "" by the urllink suicide girls friday night ."
we thought half - naked sexy <UNK> girls sounds interestingly exciting naughty fun .
i have never seen a show like that ever .
we 're thinking of checking it out next time they 're in town .
"we <UNK> in some <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"yah , we 're pretty cheap like that , haha !"
we refuse to give our hard - earned $ $ $ to the <UNK> stand .
i have n't read the book so it does n't really matter if they totally changed the plot ( so i heard ) .
"it had <#> of the most exciting car chase i have seen , what a ride !"
we had a pretty good day and the weekend was n't even over yet ...
i was listening to urllink <UNK> 's morning show on my way to work today .
"sarah and no name were just talking about <UNK> and her lesbian daughter <UNK> 's , coming - out book or something ."
they were not against gay or anything like that however i realized that there are still a lot of people out there that thinks otherwise .
"i do n't really know what 's the big deal with being gay or lesbian , man ."
i do n't understand why some people have a strong dislike or irrational hate towards them .
i have no problems or issues with them at all .
i actually think they are fun and interesting people to hang - out or make friends with .
"growing up in the philippines , it was quite common to have a gay or lesbian friend or a member of the family ."
"we do n't see them as different , they are always part of the community ."
"<UNK> accept them for who they are , or at least that 's what i think ."
we do n't go around and beat them or urllink drag them at the back of a truck and torture them .
strange <#> might say especially in a country where majority are christians - <UNK> precisely .
"well , this brings a lot of memories from <UNK> people i know back home ."
i wonder what happened to <UNK> and his gay friends .
he was a <UNK> who rented this little unit in front of our house .
it used to be our little <UNK> - <UNK> store turned it into a beauty salon .
imagine how convenient it was for us <#> teen - age girls and then a few more girl cousins here and there .
i remembered <UNK> and his gay friends were hilarious when they got together .
here 's the old <UNK> - <UNK> store - kid a @ <#> with mum and kid b.
i also have a cousin <UNK> removed who was gay .
i can assure you senior was n't too excited about him .
he was gay alright but was not in any way like <UNK> .
he did not wear women 's clothes nor make - up .
he was nowhere close to being a drag queen .
i could not forget about him because he taught me how to smoke when i was <#> .
"now , junior has a lesbian sis , <UNK> ."
"the last time i heard , she wanted to be straight and realized she actually needs a man and wants to start a family ."
i have another gay cousin <UNK> removed or whatever .
was because i think now he goes by the name michelle or some chick name like that .
"and very feminine , more feminine than the females i know ."
"he was beautiful , just like <#> of those miss gay candidates you see on tv ( well probably not in us tv ) ."
if you get a chance to see these shows do check 'em out - it 's quite entertaining .
i also have a lesbian ( or so we thought ) or should i say bi - sexual first cuz .
<UNK> as we all call her grew up to be a <UNK> .
her friends from college would always think she was a <UNK> .
then she came to the states and things changed .
she started dating and fell in love with a guy .
i always thought or noticed she 's happier with a girl but she tells me otherwise .
"whoa , i <UNK> realize there 's so many queer in the fam ."
"but i know <#> thing for sure they 're just people like you and me , they ca n't help not to be gay or lesbian ."
"understanding , acceptance and tolerance is all we need ."
well thanks to discovery channel it kept me up on the new <UNK> on <UNK> and gender issues .
recent <UNK> suggest rather strongly that human sexual orientation is to some degree <UNK> determined and/or there is a <UNK> difference between the brains of heterosexual and homosexual men .
sexual orientation is not a thing you can choose and homosexuality is not just about sex .
"it does n't necessarily mean they are bad or "" dirty , sick "" people ."
if a woman and a man love each other what is it based on ?
"so if <#> people of the same sex love each other , what 's so different ?"
love is love and that ’s what it 's all about .
<UNK> and i have decided we want to adopt urllink eric <UNK> .
we realized it is impossible to resist his charm .
"yes , we can live with this <UNK> <UNK> little bastard running around the house ."
: i would never let a woman kick my ass .
"if she tried something , i 'd be like , hey ! you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie !"
<UNK> : why is it that everything today has to do with things either going in or coming out of my ass ?
"we 're not christian , we just pretended to be ."
<UNK> : remind me to cut your balls off when we get back .
"they wanna save the earth , but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad ."
<UNK> : that movie has warped my fragile little mind .
"no , jay <UNK> 's chin is big - <UNK> ."
"well , i 've been <UNK> ' this carpet for <#> whole hours and i do n't feel like a lesbian ."
"<UNK> : the poor kid passes it to the jew , the jew shoots ."
proving once and for all that jews can not play hockey !
"no , i just have a sweet hockey body ."
<UNK> : how would you like to go see the school counselor ?
<UNK> : how would you like to suck my balls ?
<UNK> : what did you just say ? !
"<UNK> : if some girl tried to kick my ass , i 'd be like , ' hey ."
"<UNK> : <UNK> , what the hell are you talking about ?"
"i 'm just saying you 're just a little <UNK> , that 's all ."
"that 's a lot of <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"yeah , i bought all that i could at this bank , and then i got the rest from this guy ralph in an alley ."
"and the sweet thing is , the stupid asshole did n't even charge me money for it ."
he just made me close my eyes and suck on a hose .
"<UNK> : now stop wasting mel gibson 's time , you little pussy prick ."
"<UNK> : do n't take that tone with me , kid ."
"well , i 'd like to see you try ."
"i 'm , like , <#> feet tall ."
"well , you sound like a little bitch to me ."
"<UNK> : bring it on then , bitch !"
"i <UNK> it , opened it , and set it on the table , bitch ."
i want to get down on my knees and start pleasing jesus .
i want to feel his salvation all over my face .
if you do n't know urllink south park you would n't understand .
i 'm still debating who to tell about my blog thingy .
this morning i emailed my <#> sisters about it .
i have <#> other friends online from the urllink <UNK> newspaper forum that already knows .
"but when he read the urllink rainbow <UNK> entry , he thought that might upset my <UNK> cuz ."
"at lunch break , <UNK> and i did a <UNK> mile ( <#> km ) run ."
i went home for a quick shower and a bite to eat afterwards .
i got a lot of things done at urllink work today .
i pretty much completed all my tasks and cleared up a few follow - up flags on my outlook .
we saw urllink the <UNK> candidate earlier tonight .
"it was a good <UNK> , entertaining but ca n't really say i was <UNK> ."
"i think washington post 's review <UNK> it up pretty much "" a <UNK> <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all at once . """
"anyway , here are the pics i got in my mailbox today ."
"my niece , <UNK> , who just turned <#> ."
"urllink <UNK> , her <UNK> grant and their cousins ."
"urllink since there are <#> more siblings after me , i think having a dozen <UNK> and <UNK> sounds just about right ."
at least i get to see <#> of em in my email today .
urllink here 's a pic of moi and <UNK> <#> yrs ago .
"urllink with mum ( left - sitting , moi in the middle ) , cousin <UNK> ( second from right , standing ) and friends ."
"low clouds , cool and misty ... nice ! a good day to run ."
i got more photos in my mailbox from my sis <UNK> today .
and more pics of baby bro 's bday party earlier this month from my friend <UNK> in la . will post 'em later ...
i remembered <UNK> off to sleep with john kerry 's speech last night .
"( "" i do n't want to claim that god is on our side ."
"as abraham lincoln told us , i want to pray <UNK> that we are on god 's side . "" ) that was a good line ."
they are going to re - paint our pink kitchen today .
"that does n't happen very often ya know , once in a urllink blue moon i should say ."
urllink did you get to check it out ?
<UNK> and <UNK> went to see eric <UNK> ( lucky <UNK> ) in san jose saturday night .
"it was her "" father 's day <UNK> present "" , very cool , huh ?"
he wanted me to go and i would have loved to but i thought it would be great for them to spend some father - daughter time ...
it 's been a while since they went to a concert together .
"and hey , we can always watch eric <UNK> next time around ."
it was actually kinda nice to get to hang - out with <#> of my good and oldest friend <UNK> again .
we were co - workers and roommates back in the philippines eleven years ago .
she was also my old boss at work for a year or so until she quit about a year and a half ago .
we and her hubby juan used to hang - out a lot at my old place on weekends when i was living by myself .
"i remember the booze , <UNK> , <#> 's music , and a lot of old stories to tell and re - tell ."
"it was fun , we always have a blast !"
we always make sure we do n't miss her parties .
it 's almost like a <UNK> sin to decline or refuse her invitation .
"so anyway , we thought we 'd take advantage of my little night out ."
i was home <#> seconds after <UNK> and <UNK> pulled into the garage .
"we drove around and see if we hit some cool garage sales in the <UNK> earlier today , but no luck ."
"we did some chores around the house , watched tv and just kicked back until <#> pm then headed on out for <UNK> 's family dinner party ."
we get to play and <UNK> the niece and <UNK> tonight and scored a delicious meal again !
urllink this is the view i have from my window at work .
my phone rang and <UNK> our <UNK> <UNK> service was on the other end : <UNK> :
"hey , did you know that you 're the only birthday <UNK> in august ?"
"only <#> , your name is posted on the board in the employee lounge ."
"me : really , oh dear ... should i be worried ?"
"<UNK> : ( giggles ) anyway , what cake do you like ?"
"i dunno , anything <UNK> <UNK> : do you want a pie ?"
<UNK> : well you get to pick coz it 's your <UNK> me : whatever you pick .
i 'm not really a big cake or dessert person .
"<#> seconds later , birthday cake "" meeting "" was sent to all employees via email for august <#> at <#> pm ."
"laid off , no job , birthday , scary thought ."
"i do n't want to be the only <UNK> , i do n't really like be put on the spot ..."
"last night , <UNK> asked me what i want for my birthday ."
have n't really thought of anything ... <#> ) i want new hiking boots .
<#> ) i want a new pair of comfy walking sandals - black .
<#> ) i want to try a bikini wax - a <UNK> bikini wax .
<#> ) i need a new haircut and re - touch on my <UNK> .
<#> ) i want to fix my <UNK> nose .
<#> ) i want to fix my <UNK> teeth .
i had an eye doctor appointment at <UNK> at <UNK> today .
"so anyway , the doctor went through my records real quick , a little chit chat just to keep a little conversation going ."
then he told me i 'm not supposed to be there until december .
i had to get up early this morning so i could come in to work at <UNK> to make up for leaving early today and for nothing ?
"and of course , i have to go through the <UNK> again and get all the <UNK> <UNK> , etc . etc ."
"oh well , i 'm not going back to work ."
i did n't have to think hard on that <#> - the most important sense for me of course is sight .
"somehow , they got it all <UNK> so quickly that they were able to set me up for another <UNK> appointment at <UNK> right away - that evening ."
normally it would take weeks to schedule in an appointment but this time they were able to get me in so quickly ?
"now , all this rushing was <UNK> the hell out of me ."
my thoughts were already running wild at this time ...
"i 'm tellin ya , getting a urllink <UNK> eye exam is no fun ."
"getting your eyes <UNK> and <UNK> stretched and eyes <UNK> , <#> <UNK> were taking turns doing this , was soooo not fun , it 's <UNK> !"
"the <UNK> was the same , <UNK> <UNK> , it looks like ... maybe ."
so they told me i have to see a <UNK> specialist .
he told me it is not <UNK> <UNK> after all and even if it was i have to go in surgery right away .
"he was only the 4th eye doctor i saw in the last <#> hours and a half , i should be feeling okay , right ?"
"as it turned out , i am going to be okay ."
i will still see <UNK> every now and then .
i always thought <UNK> and <UNK> in my sight was normal .
or sometimes i would think they were semi - <UNK> .
when i was young around <#> or <#> years old i also thought maybe i had special powers .
now my doctor just need to keep an eye on my eyes every <#> - <#> months and make sure it 's not getting worse .
my doctor told me this is really not common for women in their <UNK> .
"well thanks , just what i wanted to hear to make me feel better , very <UNK> indeed ."
"hmmm , i 'll just have to start thinking i 'm special this way ."
we went to the urllink <UNK> county fair tonight .
we wanted to check out the garden show which we always do every year .
"the theme this time around is "" the gardens of <UNK> "" ."
i was n't as impressed as the last time but they still put up a good show i thought .
i took a few shots of some english garden landscape but some did n't turn out very well . just love the blue <UNK> on this <#> !
urllink ... there were some cool rock gardens ... urllink ... and some interesting looking plants .
"without over <UNK> what it takes to make something like this happen , here are the basics ."
"my <UNK> has evolved into a small <UNK> or more technically , a component <UNK> ."
we have been focused in our current business model for <#> months .
we will do around $ <#> <#> in revenue this year .
"about $ <UNK> will be sub contract <UNK> , and the rest direct sold business ."
around <#> % of the remainder is in <#> large contract .
today we have <#> production employees and occupy a pretty small space .
i have no other <UNK> professional help other than an old retired friend that is helping me keep my head screwed on straight .
i have found that <#> of the things that i miss most in being in a larger company is the ability to focus .
my day shifts <UNK> so fast that i can hardly stay on task for very long .
i go from ap to ar to sales to tool <UNK> to truck <UNK> to toilet <UNK> all before lunch .
"all of that experience in "" <UNK> <UNK> "" has gone out the window as i try to survive the challenges of the day ."
"my old friend knows as much about business as i do , probably more ."
he is helping to <UNK> the day to day task and get some organization in this rapidly growing project .
consider that our revenue will grow over <#> % this year .
everyday has it 's own host of challenges and today was no different .
i have to get out a truck load of product tomorrow and i am really pushing hard to not fall short .
"on top of that , i am hoping that a customer follows through on over <UNK> a check for $ <UNK> for a large job we did last month ."
you see the check is <#> days past due .
"the employees have been paid , and now the material <UNK> want to be paid and i need the check to cover the check run on friday ."
"make no mistake , financially , we are strong ."
"very strong , and our <UNK> believe in us and would help us if we got in a pinch , but i want to make it without the help ."
sometimes you have to pretend the safety net is not there make the big leap .
our goal on the line was <#> units today .
all day long we could not buy a break .
"i had <UNK> problems , line problems , and <UNK> problems ."
this was not the day to experiment with new <UNK> .
"but we did , and as a result , we suffered a bit ."
there is so much work to be done that there is no excuse for standing around talking .
you can always pick up a <UNK> or take out some trash .
the a from b players is when they run out of work .
and i only had <#> guy working in the back .
"he ran out of parts and when i got off my call , he had cleaned the bath room and was sweeping <UNK> <UNK> off the walls ."
well lunch cam and went and we were not getting on pace .
and i felt myself snap at a few of my guys .
"then , like a blessing from god , my check came ."
"when the end of the day came , i was on pace to meet my truck ."
"i do n't know how , but i was ."
i like to think it was because i ran around like a crazy person all day .
it was probably becuase i finally have a good crew and they had it under control .
it has been almost <#> years since this little science fair project ( <UNK> ) started .
what started with model a has <UNK> into model <UNK> i can honestly say that i did not start this to get rich .
my goals have always been accomplishment focused not <UNK> but that being said a <UNK> has always been in the plan .
i wanted to run a company by the time i was <#> .
glad to see that mba was coming in handy .
"up until my <UNK> , i have been an <UNK> guy ."
to me running a company <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
i was a <UNK> / systems / <UNK> / engineering management hawk .
"i knew the pieces of the puzzle , how they fit , and what it took to deliver products ."
"however , if you never sell said products , all of that is pretty worthless ."
"now you would think i , of all people , would have known that ."
"before my <UNK> , i worked for a high tech defense <UNK> with over <#> years of knowledge in the industry ."
"i was brought in to "" build <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> of best in class <UNK> "" ."
the <#> that was going to lead them to the promise land .
"but oh no , i was ready to manage a company ."
i was ready for the sales to come in and the money to start flowing .
but somewhere along the line i forgot that the most important thing is business is sales .
no sales = no employees = no profit = no <UNK> = me <UNK> toilets .
the <UNK> has sales now . and employees . and
to say i am a small business owner is only part of the story .
i am a part owner of a small business that i run .
"essentially , they invested in me to make them money ."
"today , <#> of my production employees <UNK> up the toilet and i had to <UNK> it ."
"other than that , it was just like every other day ."
today we got to enter the <UNK> again .
"i was so grateful that the whole family waited for me to get home from my workshop , even though they had been able to go up since noon ."
it was really important to me to be there with everyone at the same time .
"it was devastating to stand knee deep in hot ash , digging thru what was left of the house ."
"at first , it was hard to understand why certain things were where they were ."
"then we realized that everything upstairs , had fallen directly below and was now in the basement ."
we were able to find <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> of bits and pieces but nothing of real value .
some of them turned out really well - there is a link to the <UNK> i made at the bottom of this post .
what stands out to me the most is how <UNK> the fire was .
the fire spread with burning <UNK> so there are pockets of <UNK> as well as waves of fire that took out entire roads .
the fire fighters said that the <UNK> hit with a wall of fire that was <#> feet high .
<#> fire fighters lost their homes but kept on working until it became too dangerous .
<#> thing the city is proud of is the fact that there has not been <#> injury or death in this tragedy .
my mom had been on <UNK> alert for <#> days
so she was prepared and took almost everything valuable to her .
"we have since remembered that she forgot her wedding and prom dresses , as well as our childhood <#> mm movies which she thought that i had ."
here 's a link to a <UNK> of pictures of the house .
he brought us back some perfect tomatoes from her garden ....
we were joking that all that was left was fried green tomatoes and baked potatoes ....
today was the first day of the workshop .
overall things went well and we had a good <UNK> despite the situation .
it 's hard to get back to normal and do every day kinds of things right now - my mind is just not there ....
the bus trip was more interesting and amazing than <UNK> .
"it was unbelievable how the <UNK> went through the <UNK> , hitting some houses and <UNK> others ."
they are planning to allow residents back in the <UNK> on friday so i will post some before and after pics for you on the weekend .
"a few days ago , all the families from the area went to a local church where we found out whose homes had burned and whose were saved ."
"when fire chief <UNK> <UNK> entered the room , we gave him a standing <UNK> ."
it was the most touching moment of the evening .
it was hard to actually realize that the house was truly gone but
"when you see the address in black and white , it 's pretty clear ."
my mom was packing before she was even on alert .
she rented a <UNK> storage unit and <UNK> all her photo albums and <UNK> from her trips plus all the obvious things <#> would take .
"she forgot a few things though , like her wedding dress and our family 's favourite christmas record albums that we will miss lot ."
"the <UNK> order for my area , the lower mission , has been lifted today ."
it sure feels good to be back in my own house although <UNK> stinks of smoke and the pool adn yard are black with ash .
we are still on <#> hour <UNK> alert but it is extremely unlikely that the fire will have any serious <UNK> in our area .
"however , i wo n't be <UNK> anything yet and we 'll leave all the stuff over at jen 's until we are off alert ."
it is still threatening the southern area of the city though and we are n't out of the woods yet .
the <UNK> for the next <#> weeks is hot and sunny .
the city has arranged for buses to take the families of the burned houses up on a drive thru of their <UNK> so they can have some closure .
they are hoping to open up the area to the rest of the people by the weekend .
they 've been to the insurance people and are happy with the way things are going with that .
"they are planning to start building as soon as possible , not sure if they 'll be able to get it started before winter sets in though ."
they are going to stay with us until october and then are moving into a a <#> bedroom <UNK> <UNK> suite until the house is built .
"my mom 's house was definitely lost , plus <#> of her close neighbours ."
i now have to organize this stupid workshop for <#> people on thurs and fri from my <UNK> .
we found a new venue and are trying to let everyone know as well as make <UNK> to be ready .
so many people are <UNK> that it 's hard to find teachers who can come and help do the set up .
we saw mom 's house on the news yesterday .
"i 'm at a friend 's house , using her computer ."
probably wo n't have much chance to use it again but will try to check in once a day .
"at the last moment , as the police cars were driving thru the <UNK> telling us to get out immediately , jesse locked the keys in my car ."
i told him he 'd have to try to get through the road block and that i would run down to meet him .
i ran down to the corner and asked the police if they 'd let him through - it was the longest <#> minutes i ever had to wait .
finally he arrived with the second set of keys and we drove back home to open up the van and get out of there .
we drove back to <UNK> 's house and parked the <UNK> in the backyard .
the <UNK> are staying in a friend 's house across the lake .
"as for my mom 's place , we think it 's gone ."
over <#> homes were lost last night and more expected tonight when the wind picks up .
i just looked at the <UNK> shots on the <UNK> website and the fire is clearly over my mom 's house .
"unless the shots are n't that accurate , it 's gone ."
this whole thing is like a night <UNK> for our city .
will post more later or else whenever i get back into my house .
we went into the <UNK> centre this afternoon to register .
"overwhelming emotion that hits you when you walk in that place and realize you are <#> of "" those "" people ."
the tears <UNK> up and it was hard to answer the questions for the volunteers .
"the people there are amazingly helpful and compassionate - in fact , they are so nice , it almost makes it harder ."
"mom and i are both in tears everytime someone says something "" nice "" ."
all the kids at my school are <UNK> so school start up is in question now .
"oh and also , it looks like our old house that we loved so much up in <UNK> <UNK> is gone too ."
and about <#> others that we built for other people in that <UNK> .
they 're <UNK> a <#> km from me .
"in case the power goes out , this will be my last email ."
"you can hear the police car loud speakers telling everyone to "" leave immediately - this is an <UNK> order ! "" ."
"jesse got tired of hearing them as he sat in the car waiting for us to finishing packing , and <UNK> back "" we are <UNK> !"
""" too bad a kid his age has to even <UNK> what <UNK> means ."
we may be offline for a week or <#> .
i will post just before we leave if we have to go .
we have a generator but i do n't know if <UNK> will think the computer is a priority ... ;)
"in the parking lot of the grocery store , we could feel the heat from the fire and the smoke cloud above the mission was <UNK> ."
a really hot wind was blowing and chunks of burning houses were landing everywhere .
we <UNK> thru the grocery store grabbing the stuff we needed and <UNK> home .
all you can hear are <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> .
"big winds now . just heard the fire guard has been <UNK> in <#> areas - <#> of them is <UNK> , the street mom lives on ."
winds are supposed to stay until around <#> pm .
he took angie 's <UNK> and our guitars over there as well as my boxes of photo albums and other important business papers .
"right now , we 're heading back over to the school and pick up <#> boxes of <UNK> and <UNK> them to jen 's ."
we will probably have to change the workshop venue but i 'll worry about that on another day .
my heart has been pounding all day - a constant <UNK> rush .
i wonder how long you can survive at that level ?
around 7:00 pm my mom called me to say that huge military <UNK> were <UNK> <UNK> of water right in front and right over her house .
she has a home on a hill with a beautiful lake view in a <UNK> in the trees on the <UNK> of <UNK> .
there had been spot fires happening occasionally when burning <UNK> were carried by the wind several km 's away .
we heard many many fire trucks screaming their way up the hill to the area close to fire .
they did n't think it would be needed but were just checking in case the fire got worse .
it had been so quiet all day we thought we were going to be ok since the wind had n't picked up as expected .
i immediately called my mom and the other family and let them know .
"within minutes , tons of packed up cars began streaming down the hill blocking every possible access route in and out ."
most of those were $ <UNK> and some are <UNK> because they are out of the fire protection district .
mom and rod were more or less ready to go and managed to get down the <#> minutes trip within about <#> minutes .
the other family arrived at our place about <#> hours later .
they had done no packing up until that point because nobody really believed that they 'd have to <UNK> .
the traffic was so heavy some people took <#> hours to travel a <#> minute ride .
people who live across the lake could get an excellent view of the entire fire now that the smoke had cleared somewhat . with <UNK>
i am heading in to the school right now and check out what the plan is .
over <#> people in <#> homes have been <UNK> and <#> more homes are on <#> hour alert .
i truly do n't believe that it will ever come to being <UNK> but who knows .
there are so many houses between me and the fire .
"we 're all sitting out front in the driveway , watching the flames on the <UNK> to the south of us ."
"during the day , it 's so <UNK> you ca n't see anything but at night , when the trees candle , it 's an unbelievably scary show ."
"mom and rod in the guest room , andrew and stephanie in angie 's room , angie and vanessa and <UNK> on <UNK> in the living room ."
<UNK> has n't been taking any of this seriously but he said he will start moving some of our stuff over to jen 's place tomorrow .
"if we get <UNK> , all of us will <UNK> to find places to stay ."
either at <UNK> 's or maybe at jen 's .
the wind just picked up and now they 've just changed mom and rod 's <UNK> alert to an <UNK> order .
<#> families are now packing up and getting out .
the <UNK> and fire engines are going crazy .
mom and rod stayed overnight with us last night because they did n't want to be <UNK> in the middle of the night .
today they went back home and spent the afternoon packing up more stuff as the fires get closer .
mom called me a little while ago to tell that the <UNK> were <UNK> directly over her house .
"i have been watching the tv news , listening the the radio , and watching the <UNK> website all day long ."
i heard the <UNK> order come through and called mom to tell her .
also called another family who had asked if they could stay with us in the event they were <UNK> .
it 's been very stable all night and they are currently building a huge fire break along the miles of forest behind the houses .
we 're all just crossing our fingers that the wind does n't pick up this afternoon as is <UNK> .
i will try to post some pics of it but i do n't know if it will do it justice .
the sun is just a faint red ball and the smoke is incredibly thick .
we 're trying to keep the doors shut but it just <UNK> in through the cracks .
i have a headache and it 's so hard to sleep at night .
i am feeling stressed because i have to get this huge workshop organized for teachers next week .
"today we spent all afternoon locked up in a friend 's basement , stuffing <UNK> into <UNK> ."
<#> friends were able to come and help me .
it was so hot and <UNK> in there .
i have about <#> big boxes of finished <UNK> ready for the workshop next week .
"there 's so much smoke , you can barely see the sun and everything thing has an <UNK> orange <UNK> to it ."
we could n't see what the fire was doing all day because of the smoke
but apparently it 's still burning away from <UNK> .
"all day , white ash fell like a light snow <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's throat has been <UNK> and the smoke really bugs him .
"for me , it just burns my nose , but i 've been thinking about all the people like your kids who have <UNK> etc ."
the fire has grown from <#> acres yesterday morning to <#> acres this afternoon .
"unfortunately , that direction is headed directly for my aunt and uncle 's house in <UNK> ."
tonight the wind is supposed to switch back to the north and start blowing it back towards <UNK> again .
it 's about <#> km from my mom 's house .
she has rented a storage unit and has moved all of her photos and important stuff .
"every day that she 's on alert , she finds more things to move though ."
"hi again , just got back from our trip to vancouver island ."
"while we were gone , angie and mom both called to tell me that another forest fire had started ."
this time it 's practically in my own back yard .
"it started on monday night - this time a lightning strike in <UNK> mountain park , about <#> miles from my mom 's house ."
my mom lives in a <UNK> in the hills and is on <#> hour <UNK> alert .
she wants me to come and pick up the <#> <UNK> of <UNK> she just did ... lol .
i took pics of the fire from the <UNK> highway as we drove into town - it 's unbelievable .
i do n't think we 're in any danger because there are plenty of houses between us and the forest but my mom might not so lucky .
it 's weird to be going through this again so soon after the <UNK> fire .
"my <UNK> and <UNK> are back in their hotel btw , but they had quite a bit of smoke damage ."
the fire fighters stayed in the hotel during the <UNK> .
louis creek and <UNK> town have been hit pretty hard .
"weeks later , the power is still out too ..."
hi guys - i 'm back from our august long weekend trip .
we had an unbelievable start to our camping weekend due to the forest <UNK> <UNK> up here .
"about <#> minutes away from their hotel , we saw a <UNK> forest fire being fought in the hills on <#> side of the highway ."
"it was just <#> of many small fires in bc right now , but i took some pictures of it since it was so close ."
we talked a bit about the fire which has started the day before by a careless <UNK> .
the fire was under control and some of the <UNK> were actually staying at the hotel .
about <#> of them were expected at the hotel restaurant for dinner at <#> pm .
"around that same time , a sudden wind storm blew through , so hard it actually blew an open door of the hotel right off its <UNK> ."
"about an hour later , the valley began to fill with smoke , coming down the highway , as well as over the hill behind the hotel ."
there was even light ash falling from the sky .
the hotel has a pub so we got lots of news from towns people coming and going from the restaurant and pub .
apparently the wind had caused the fire to jump the <UNK> and it was now out of control and growing quickly .
people in louis creek had been put on <UNK> notice and many were coming into town to find places to stay .
"at about <#> pm , we learned that my <UNK> 's <UNK> 's house , as well as several others in louis creek , had been destroyed by fire ."
my <UNK> <UNK> began to get worried that it might get to <UNK> and she started packing up even though we had n't received any <UNK> .
"we all thought she was over - <UNK> but we helped her pack up her pictures , and clothes and <UNK> into the car and truck ."
this was going to be a real problem since the hotel was full and the restaurant <UNK> and <UNK> were full of food .
"sure enough , at about 11:30 the power went out ."
it was still <UNK> hot and so <UNK> my eyes were burning .
i woke up at <#> am and listened to the news and heard the fire had grown even more . at about <#> am
we got a <#> hour <UNK> notice and we all started helping ben and <UNK> pack up the rest of their stuff .
my nephew hooked up his <UNK> and got ready to leave at a moment 's notice .
the smoke was heavy and lots of ash and even burned leaves and pine needles covered everything .
we hung around and waited as long as we could to get more news and to see what was going to happen .
their other option was to travel north and then take the long way to vancouver .
we planned to continue heading north to get to my sister 's cabin where we were planning to spend the weekend .
i took pictures of the red smoke <UNK> over the <UNK> and it looked like the flames would reach the peak at any moment .
we were in direct line of fire and it was scary but we still did n't believe that it would actually get to the town .
"i finally left <UNK> at about noon , not knowing exactly when ben and <UNK> would be leaving or where they would go ."
the <UNK> had decided to go north and travel back to vancouver .
"on the way out of town , i took some great shots of the smoke and fire in the distance ."
we only had a <#> tank of gas and all the power was out for the next <#> miles so no gas stations were open .
we managed to make it to a gas station where there was a huge line up of cars and <UNK> all trying to get gas .
eventually we made it to the cabin where we spent the rest of the weekend .
unfortunately we had no cell service so we could n't call my <UNK> and see if they made it to their destination .
"that night , we were able to get in <#> channel on our tv in the <UNK> and we watched the news ."
the <UNK> said that the fire had reached <UNK> in the afternoon and that it was so out of control that the <UNK> had had to pull out .
<#> people ) was on fire and it looked like it was going to be completely destroyed .
it seemed unbelievable that i had just been there a few hours earlier .
the next morning we watched the news again and the reports were <UNK> .
"some said the town was gone , others said only a few homes and businesses had been burned . but"
over <#> people had been <UNK> in all .
"<#> major <UNK> have been closed , <#> towns and many smaller <UNK> have been completely <UNK> and <#> 's of homes and businesses have been burned ."
the <UNK> for the next <#> days is for more sun and heat and wind .
there are also <UNK> in the <UNK> which means the start of more fires .
we left the cabin this morning and had to travel the long way home but made it home this afternoon .
we do n't know when they will be able to go home .
i think it should be illegal to go to work on weekends .
having to work on a saturday or sunday is just plain wrong .
:( the only good thing about having to work today is that i really like my job and most of the people i work with .
"i work in retail and i really like working with all the different people , even the nasty customers ."
i get to develop pictures and make <UNK> and <UNK> and fun stuff like that .
i love <UNK> anyway so this was the perfect job for me .
i am <UNK> telling my husband that what other job do you know of where you can go around the world and never leave home ?
i 'm thinking of taking some photo classes at the college this winter .
i really enjoy taking pictures and thought it might be fun to learn a few things .
i was <UNK> by an experience my <#> year old endured the other day .
"to begin , i taught my son how to play chess and he has gotten pretty good ."
he has <UNK> his skills against me and a wonderful game called urllink learn to play chess with <UNK> and <UNK> .
"so , to explain the incident , he was playing chess with an adult who supposedly new the rules of chess , but hadn’t played in many years ."
they played for a while before they got into a violent <UNK> about the rules .
does a <UNK> eat pieces <UNK> or straight ahead ?
all the other adults that were around couldn’t settle the dispute since none played chess .
they <UNK> a while and noted that my son did have a habit to <UNK> rules in other games to favor him .
with this fact in hand they decided that he had to be cheating .
so the <UNK> was that he must be guilty as charged .
not <#> person bothered to call someone or even look up the rules online to <UNK> their decision .
i know that i myself will no try to understand the facts before i draw any conclusions .
a friend and client of mine was having a bad day .
"that in itself is nothing new , but it led to him answering a simple email with multiple <UNK> questions in the wrong way ."
"normally we would have brushed it off because of the strong relationship we have with him , but this response hit a nerve on our side ."
"we read the email and <UNK> not only on his <UNK> of the questions asked , but the short tone he used when answering ."
"let me be clear , i like this client and the loyalty we <UNK> have with each other wasn’t <UNK> well in the email ."
"so , on our side we broke down the email to find what was bugging us ."
"it wasn’t just the <UNK> or the <UNK> , but that he wrote all his responses in all caps ."
this <UNK> led us to believe that he was screaming at us .
i learned some valuable lessons through this email .
"i almost forgot , don’t use all caps since it does <UNK> screaming and looks terrible to read ."
"i didn’t think i would ever do something like this , but we did and it ended up being a fun day out for the family ."
what we didn’t count on was fish that were a little harder to catch if you didn’t know the secret to lake <UNK> .
"that secret , fish love fish food and ignore worms ."
"after hours of trying to <UNK> many a fish onto a <UNK> hook , we <UNK> to the $ <#> trick ."
we lowered an empty fish hook to the surface of the lake and then threw a handful of floating fish <UNK> right around it .
the <UNK> frenzy for surface food induced an <UNK> bite onto the expose hook and a quick fight to pull them in .
"so , a few minutes of renewed fishing produced <#> fish to take home ."
for an extra $ <#> the lake <UNK> employees gut the fish so it was up to me to prepare them for our evening feast .
"never having prepared a fish for eating , we immediate called the in - laws for some advice ."
"they gave us words of wisdom , but maybe not of much use ."
they said “ when we have had <UNK> in a restaurant it served bones and all ” .
"after screwing up the <UNK> , who new you <UNK> the fish with oil and then <UNK> them into the bread <UNK> , i finally finished cooking the food ."
"now , <UNK> are <UNK> fish so we proceeded to eat <UNK> style making sure all the bones were out so that we would not have any choking kids ."
all in all it was a good trip with satisfying results .
"all except for the part where my <#> year old asked , “ do you think the fish felt pain ? ”"
"to which i calmly replied , not any more ."
well that and few other things were learned over last friday .
"my son , who is <#> , was complaining of a pain of <#> out of <#> in his cheek ."
upon examination of his mouth we realized that a piece of his tooth had broken off .
once we started calling for appointments we realized that a large percentage either didn’t work at all on fridays or only worked until noon .
"well , with a little luck , we found a dentist that would look at my son and evaluate the situation ."
"neither of which they or most <UNK> perform on children so i would have to find a <UNK> , <UNK> dentist ."
"so my first thought is , what is a <UNK> ?"
my second is that only <UNK> would number things with letters .
"my last is , here we go again , time to find a dentist , <UNK> , on a friday ."
"i calmly tell them that while i am <UNK> , it is hard to look things up on the internet while sitting in the parking lot of the dentist ."
i informed them that if i had access to the internet i wouldn’t bother to call so it would be great if they could get me a list .
"well , the answer is none , at least not any within <#> miles ."
"now , i do not live on the planet mars , i am in a <UNK> of chicago ."
i then <UNK> to the old fashion way of doing things and page through the yellow pages to accomplish the task at hand .
i actually have some advice for those would be managers out there .
"yes , they are a necessary evil , but they can be useful ."
some are born with it and others grow into it .
"i believe it will <UNK> at some future date , but for today i am <UNK> ."
"they’re cutting through the <UNK> , clearing it out ."
"the leader is the <#> who <UNK> up the <UNK> tree , <UNK> the entire situation , and yells , ‘ wrong <UNK> ”"
"to that i say great , as long as they understand what they are managing ."
a manager that gets their hands dirty is worth their weight in gold .
for the most part though it means that someone else is doing the work and they are just <UNK> the i and crossing the t in the project .
they do no real work and add very little value .
the worst types are the ones that i refer to as “
"they can and will work , but aren’t workers ."
they are the glue that moves and organization forward and that the producers flock to .
"just because someone has a fancy title , doesn’t make them a leader ."
after <UNK> it out in <UNK> for the last <#> years i have seen plenty of “ <UNK> ” managers and “ <UNK> ” leaders .
they are the ones that rule by fear and by <UNK> their titles .
i am the boss ” with everyone knowing that the answer is
they give all the responsibility to other while keeping all the authority so that they can stick it to you later .
"lead , follow , or get out of the way ."
as we head into the presidential election all my friends that are republicans sent me the site urllink
<UNK> so that i would understand what a <#> faced turn coat kerry is .
all my democratic friends want me to see fahrenheit <#> to sway me to anti bush he attacked iraq for personal reasons side . as far as i am concerned
", they both are less than ideal candidates ."
"we are stuck with bush as a candidate since he is the current president , but come on , kerry ?"
how do we american ’s keep putting candidates up there that do not represent the american people ?
"george , not the <UNK> tool in the shed , bush at least sticks to his guns and doesn’t <UNK> ."
both are of an american <UNK> elite that really doesn’t understand how <#> % of the rest of us live .
"as far as my vote , i just don’t know ."
"i will vote , but i will vote conscience ."
"i will vote for the person who best represents my ideal which is small government , states rights , and no welfare ."
"i used to think that was republican , but now am no longer sure ."
for any of you out there who haven’t seen urllink <UNK> it is a good laugh .
"on a side note , what do you think about <UNK> obama ’s , urllink <UNK> , run for the illinois senate seat ?"
that seems to be a candidate you can really like .
"i was skeptical about him at first , but have grown to like his sharp wit and intellect ."
the night before peekskill <UNK> - under coach windy <UNK> got the opportunity to coach at the new peekskill stadium .
"“ it ’s great to be here , ” said <UNK> , after peekskill ’s <UNK> - under <UNK> squad defeated <UNK> <#> - <#> ."
“ it ’s just amazing how beautiful this field is and how the kids enjoyed it .
“ this is the most beautiful park i’ve seen in a long time .
"” the most important thing was that the kids played as a team and they played their hearts out , according to <UNK> . “"
"there was no yelling or screaming , ” <UNK> said ."
"that ’s the way the game should be played , the way they played it tonight ."
"” the field isn’t just a <UNK> for peekskill baseball , it ’s also a good thing for the county , according to <UNK> ."
"“ it brings in here all the other towns and cities , ” <UNK> said ."
“ they can play their games here for a <UNK> fee
it ’s great for the county of <UNK> that you have a beautiful field like this .
hopefully other <UNK> and cities do the same thing as peekskill did here . “
"“ the kids are <UNK> , ” <UNK> said ."
“ some feel <UNK> been left out of other teams .
"in addition to kids from peekskill , we also have kids from <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ."
the lights went on for the first time at the new peekskill stadium in the latter stages of peekskill ’s <UNK> - under division contest against <UNK> .
"peekskill pitcher chris <UNK> however was on right from the beginning of the friday , july <#> <UNK> <UNK> baseball association contest ."
"<UNK> pitched into the seventh inning , allowing just <#> earned runs and <#> walks while striking out <#> in peekskill ’s <#> - <#> win ."
<UNK> became the first peekskill pitcher to win a game at peekskill stadium .
“ hopefully this can be a building block for the peekskill baseball <UNK> <UNK> said .
<UNK> was backed up by a superb relief performance by john <UNK> .
<UNK> jumped off to <#> - <#> lead in the first inning but peekskill ( <#> - <#> ) came back with <#> runs in the third .
"scoring for peekskill was mike <UNK> , <UNK> and billy <UNK> , who scored on a ralph <UNK> single ."
<UNK> is hoping a win like this can give peekskill momentum for the rest of the summer and into next spring during the varsity season .
"“ we have the talent on varsity , ” <UNK> said ."
” that would be a <UNK> goal for the peekskill varsity squad considering it finished <#> - <#> - <#> this spring .
however <UNK> the final <#> games against section <#> class a <UNK> <UNK> gives the red devils hope for the future .
"“ if we bring it every game we can be tough to beat , ” <UNK> said ."
playing this summer for the peekskill <UNK> team is a big help for <UNK> .
"“ it ’s important because you don’t want to go to the varsity rusty , ” <UNK> said ."
“ i didn’t play in the summer last year and i was rusty this spring .
"as for the win against <UNK> , <UNK> did his job by keeping the <UNK> off balance ."
"“ i didn’t have my <UNK> but i had my location , ” <UNK> said ."
“ my ball had a lot of movement on it .
"in addition to ball movement , staying within himself was a key according to peekskill coach andy <UNK> ."
“ he did what he was asked to do .
"for peekskill <UNK> - under coach windy <UNK> , being able to coach the first game at the new peekskill stadium is something that goes beyond words ."
"“ i’ve been in peekskill for <#> years and we finally got a quality , first - rate stadium ."
"” <UNK> park is where the peekskill baseball program previously hosted all of its home games beyond little league , which plays at <UNK> park ."
<UNK> feels that the new stadium will help peekskill keep kids playing baseball beyond their <UNK> years .
kids that played little league in peekskill for a long time didn’t have anywhere to go . “
"you look now there were a lot of little <UNK> here tonight , that were saying that <#> day they could play here ."
"we’re <UNK> but the guys are a bunch of good guys who work hard , ”"
"“ we need some work , we need some time ."
to build a program takes a little effort and a little time . “
i’m saying in a year or <#> watch the difference in the program .
peekskill ’s dan <UNK> opened up the bottom of the first inning against <UNK> with a single in the <UNK> <UNK> baseball association <UNK> - under contest .
normally that wouldn’t <UNK> but in this case it was .
"that ’s because it was the first hit at the brand new peekskill stadium on thursday , july <#> ."
"“ it felt really good , ” said <UNK> , <#> ."
"i think it was the first pitch , a fast ball right down the middle ."
"“ it means a lot to me , ” said <UNK> , who was <#> for <#> with <#> runs scored ."
“ this is an historic night for peekskill and all the teams in <UNK> county .
” the importance of playing in the summer for <UNK> and his <UNK> goes beyond baseball .
i will make a lot of lifetime friends playing baseball .
” <UNK> played on the peekskill <UNK> baseball squad this spring and will be a junior this fall .
he feels that the new field is a sign of things to come for the peekskill baseball program .
"“ it ’s ( having the new field ) is really important to play for the future of the program , ” <UNK> said ."
"after getting a single to lead off the bottom of the first , <UNK> stole second and third before being driving in by base hit from tyler <UNK> ."
"<UNK> himself stole second and was driven in by jonathan <UNK> , who <UNK> ."
<UNK> though took control of the game with <#> runs in the second and <#> in the third .
<UNK> ’s anthony <UNK> hit the first home run in peekskill stadium in the sixth .
"peekskill scored its other run in the third when <UNK> <UNK> , stole second and third before being driven in by a chris <UNK> single ."
"it was a glorious day , wednesday , july <#> at the dedication ceremony for peekskill stadium ."
the stadium was something that people in peekskill have been waiting a long time for .
a lot of people put in a ton of effort to make the stadium a reality .
"however , there is <#> person that without his efforts the stadium would not have been built and that ’s don foster ."
foster has been the main force behind the stadium and simply would not stop until the kids of peekskill got their <UNK> - sized baseball field .
"during the ceremony , dave <UNK> , a retired physical education teacher in the peekskill school district , commented how important foster ’s efforts were to having a field ."
he talked about the fact that the city of peekskill waited <#> years for this place because so many people had the attitude “
"i’m only <#> person , what can i do ? ”"
"<UNK> then pointed out that foster was that <#> person that decided to do something , <UNK> an effort that took <#> years to come to <UNK> ."
<UNK> ’s words stuck with me because i fell into that trap of “
"i’m only <#> person , what can i do ? ”"
i’m referring to the fact that there is no longer a weekly paper that <UNK> in on just the peekskill area only .
"after listening to <UNK> ’s speech , i decided that maybe <#> person can make a difference ."
so i decided to start a blog focusing on peekskill sports .
"however , with the help of everyone , this blog can make a difference ."
"for the fourth - straight year , peekskill graduate and los <UNK> forward <UNK> brand will have a basketball clinic for the kids of peekskill ."
"the clinic will take place today , saturday , aug . <#> at the <UNK> building on john <UNK> <UNK> ."
"at <#> a.m. with a press conference taking place <UNK> ( for more info , see “ brand clinic to take place ” in archives , aug ."
<#> ) . it ’s great to see brand take the time to come and help the youth of peekskill once again .
so many times we hear the stories of big - time athletes who get the money and never go back to their hometown .
he sincerely enjoys coming back to his hometown and seeing the joy of the faces on the kids that have come to see him at the clinic .
"<#> just has to look in brand ’s eyes and see them light up , whether he ’s talking to the kids or showing them how to shoot ."
not only is it a chance to see brand but over the years past peekskill players have <UNK> to help run the clinic .
last year ’s clinic included hilton armstrong and <UNK> <UNK> .
’s squad that went to the state championship game in <#> .
that was only the third team in peekskill history to advance to a state final .
armstrong also played this winter for the <#> national champion <UNK> squad .
so those kids who get to come out and see brand may not only see <#> former red devil <UNK> but plenty more .
"it was quite a night for mike <UNK> , who plays for peekskill ’s <UNK> <UNK> baseball association <UNK> - under squad ."
"<UNK> , peekskill ’s <UNK> <UNK> , went <#> for <#> including a walk in peekskill ’s <#> - <#> loss against visiting <UNK> hills ."
"peekskill will finish its season when it hosts <UNK> in a double - <UNK> at peekskill stadium the following day , aug . <#> at <#> p.m."
the double - dip will be the season finale for peekskill .
"“ we just want to go out with a bang , ” <UNK> said ."
“ we want to get some wins and show teams that we’re not out of it completely .
” the senior to be from <UNK> hudson started off peekskill ’s <#> - run first against <UNK> hills with a walk .
"“ when i lead off , i just want to get on base , ” <UNK> said ."
“ i want everyone behind me to do everything else .
chris ( edwards ) and joe ( <UNK> ) usually knock me in .
"after <UNK> hills scored in the third , <UNK> was in the position of being the <#> to have to drive in the run in the fourth ."
"he did so with a single that brought in brian <UNK> , who <UNK> ."
<UNK> then tried to get peekskill back ahead with a <#> - out single in the home team ’s last at bat .
"peekskill though couldn’t push home a run , which sealed its fate ."
"“ i was up second that inning , ” <UNK> said ."
i was hoping that phil ( <UNK> george ) would drop a good <UNK> .
but the pitcher made a nice play to get him out .
i was hoping that with his speed he would get on second so with a base hit i could tie the game .
"” while his single couldn’t tie the game up , he nevertheless has enjoyed his new role as <UNK> man ."
"“ this is actually the first time where i’ve <UNK> lead off all the time , <#> percent , ” <UNK> said ."
"“ as a <UNK> man , i felt my job was to just get on base ."
"“ i usually bat towards the bottom , ” <UNK> said ."
“ a couple of times i’ve <UNK> in the <#> spot when i was on <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> .
what ’s also different for <UNK> is playing with kids from peekskill .
"“ i’m not used to playing with these guys since i play for <UNK> <UNK> during the school year , ” <UNK> said ."
but i’ve been doing good so i’m excited to be on this team .
"in addition to that game , peekskill will also being taken part in a <UNK> at the stadium sunday , aug ."
"calling peekskill stadium home from that league is the peekskill <UNK> , sponsored by sound federal savings bank ."
"peekskill ( <#> - <#> ) will host the <UNK> red sox ( <#> - <#> ) sunday , aug ."
<#> at <#> a.m. in its regular - season finale .
peekskill enters the contest on a <#> - game winning streak .
peekskill started the streak with a win against the new york <UNK> <#> - <#> .
the <UNK> continued their success by winning <#> - <#> against the <UNK> <UNK> .
the game was the first for the <UNK> in peekskill stadium .
it ’s a win that shows everyone that the <UNK> can do some serious damage in the <UNK> .
peekskill then swept a <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> <#> - <#> and <#> - <#> to set up the <UNK> with <UNK> .
"in other baseball news , there will be fall youth baseball in peekskill but in exactly what format has yet to be determined ."
"peekskill is contemplating playing in the <UNK> baseball association and having an <UNK> - under team , according to <UNK> supervisor ray <UNK> ."
that would make the experience a unique <#> should they decide to ultimately play in the <UNK> .
"if your <#> years and up and want to go back in memory lane , playing an old - <UNK> ’s <UNK> game is the ticket for you ."
"brush ’s old - <UNK> ’s <UNK> game will take place saturday , aug . <#> from <#> a.m. to <#> p.m. between james and bank streets ."
"sisters in support <UNK> the game , in association with the city of peekskill and parks <UNK> department and peekskill celebration <#> ."
"the game is in its sixth year and was started by roger hamilton , who still runs the event ."
hamilton started the event because he wanted to show kids how another generation had fun without having to do drugs or drink alcohol .
there will be <UNK> music by dj <UNK> entertainment and eva ’s “ big bounce ” air castle .
those who have a favorite stick are encouraged to bring it .
"for more information , contact hamilton at <#> - <#> ."
"<#> , also <#> a.m. to <#> p.m. mike <UNK> - <#> - <UNK>"
<#> of the best programs in peekskill over the years has been the peekskill <UNK> and parks department swimming program and this year has proved to be no exception .
"peekskill ( <#> - <#> ) , <UNK> by <#> peekskill high school graduate dana <UNK> , tied for the division iii championship ."
"peekskill shared the championship with <UNK> , with each team <UNK> <#> points in the <UNK> ."
’s lone loss was against <UNK> hills <#> - <#> .
the program has always had a lot of kids participate in it and this year was no exception with <#> <UNK> being involved .
there will be much more about the swimming team ’s championship season on this site in the near future .
"“ it ’s a fun event and it ’s in my hometown , which makes it nice ."
"” this year ’s race will be this saturday , aug ."
"“ it ’s not so much competing but people just enjoying running in a race that is either in their hometown or close by , ” <UNK> said ."
the proceeds from the race will go to peekskill celebration and the annual columbus day youth races in <UNK> park in peekskill .
"“ it ’s really important that we do something to help the youth of the community , ” <UNK> said ."
“ a lot of kids have run those races for a long time .
they have their pictures taken at those races and still have them even when their adults .
"” winning last year ’s jan peek <UNK> , which had <#> participants , was peekskill ’s michael <UNK> ( <#> minutes and <#> seconds ) ."
"the top female <UNK> was also from peekskill , elsie <UNK> ( <UNK> ) ."
there were other runners from peekskill that <UNK> in last summer ’s race as well .
ted bitter ( <UNK> ) was second in the men ’s <#> - <#> <UNK> .
those looking to catch los angeles <UNK> forward and peekskill high school graduate <UNK> brand <UNK> will have <#> chances to do so .
brand will be at madison square garden to play the new york <UNK> <UNK> .
<#> at 7:30 p.m. and the <UNK> to play the new jersey <UNK> march <#> at 7:30 p.m. brand will also be on television in the area <UNK> .
"<#> , thanksgiving night at 10:30 p.m. against the <UNK> on <UNK> and yes and jan ."
<#> at 10:30 p.m. against the <UNK> on msg . both of those games are in los angeles .
"peekskill <UNK> won the game by <UNK> , but sean ’s dad , windy , who <UNK> peekskill , didn’t think that would accomplish anything ."
"“ i don’t ever want to take a <UNK> , ” said windy <UNK> , whose team will host <UNK> tonight , aug ."
like i said before it ’s an unbelievable facility .
it ’s great for our team and it ’s great for the visiting team .
they were talking about how great the stadium was .
"it ’s going to <UNK> , it ’s going to help peekskill a great deal . ” where sean <UNK> falls into all of this"
is <UNK> needed <#> more player to play or else there would be no choice but for peekskill ( <#> - <#> ) to accept the <UNK> win .
“ he ( his dad ) asked me do i want to play for the other team and
“ i was wondering what would happen when i got home if i won while playing for <UNK> .
” it ’s an opportunity that sean <UNK> had been asking his dad for all summer for .
i knew he would play hard and he did .
"” sean <UNK> , who <UNK> in his first at bat , was grateful for the opportunity ."
"“ it was a good experience , ” sean <UNK> said ."
“ <#> of the differences playing older kids is the look of a curve - ball .
"” <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> barnes and dan <UNK> led peekskill with <#> hits <UNK> ."
"also recording a base hit each were sean <UNK> , tyler <UNK> and dan <UNK> ."
"chris <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> scored for peekskill ."
“ there was just no closure with the way things went last year .
"plus , i would like to help a lot of these kids in the <UNK> process for college this year . ”"
"including all the sports he has <UNK> , <UNK> has been involved in high school <UNK> roughly <#> years ."
"he spent part of his time away from peekskill traveling to los angeles <UNK> games , watching his former player , <UNK> brand ."
he would usually go to games with brand ’s mom <UNK> but sometimes did get to travel with the team .
"“ the travel can be <UNK> , it ’s not as <UNK> as everyone thinks it is , ” <UNK> said ."
“ i didn’t even travel the whole <#> months and i was getting tired .
"“ the thing i enjoyed most was being able to follow <UNK> so closely , watching him play basketball at the highest level ."
” getting to see the national basketball association up close and personal was an eye - opening experience for <UNK> .
"“ i got to see how hard these players really work , ” <UNK> said ."
"“ so many people just think that once you get to the nba you got it made , that you don’t work hard anymore and that ’s not true ."
the <UNK> worked as hard as they did at the end of the year as they did at the beginning .
i had a different vision of the nba .
i thought that it was just players <UNK> on their offensive game but what i saw was totally different than that .
the players in the nba work very hard on playing defense .
” <#> didn’t have to look any further than the finals this past june to realize how important defense is . “
"look what happened in the finals , ” <UNK> said ."
the lakers may have been the more talented team <UNK> but they couldn’t beat the defense of the pistons .
” nba players just don’t work hard on defense according to <UNK> .
"“ they just work hard in general , ” <UNK> said ."
"“ when they travel to a city , they will go right to the gym and practice ."
that ’s tough to do because you don’t have a lot of time to practice in the nba with an <UNK> schedule .
"los angeles <UNK> <UNK> forward and <#> peekskill high school graduate <UNK> brand will be in town saturday , aug . <#> for his basketball clinic ."
the clinic will be held at the <UNK> building on john <UNK> <UNK> .
"“ nobody will be turned away , ” said <UNK> , who will be running the clinic with brand ."
"the below is when the clinic , which is for both boys and girls , will be held for each age group :"
this venture is to support academic intervention programs for the youth in the peekskill school district .
"it ’s intended to help kids with their math and reading skills , primarily at the elementary school level ."
brand and <UNK> will each be putting in $ <#> <UNK> to support the project .
"this came about when brand ’s agent , dave <UNK> from <UNK> was talking to representatives from <UNK> , who agreed to match whatever brand put up ."
"<UNK> is always looking to help kids in peekskill , that ’s why he has the clinic every year , ” <UNK> said ."
“ in the past he also had a concert but decided to do something else this year that would be more lasting for the kids .
” that ’s not all brand is doing for the youth of peekskill .
"<#> at <#> p.m. there will be a press conference to announce the non - profit company camp inc . , which stands for <UNK> action model for peekskill ."
it was formed with the support of brand .
there will be a <UNK> cutting ceremony which the whole community is invited to .
"will be a learning and resource center at <#> bank street , right next to the peekskill health care center in downtown peekskill ."
the center will include the nba ’s read to achieve program in <UNK> brand ’s name .
"there will also be a golf tournament , monday , sept ."
part of the proceeds from the tournament will go to to a scholarship award in each of their names to peekskill and <UNK> <UNK> .
the rest of the proceeds will go to the learning and resource center .
"any questions on any of the above , please call <UNK> at <#> - <#> - <#> ."
"during the summer , paul <UNK> spends his time as <#> of the <UNK> on peekskill 's <UNK> - under <UNK> <UNK> baseball association squad ."
when it comes to the school year however he <UNK> cross country in the fall and track in the winter and spring months at peekskill high school .
"for <UNK> , the challenge to <UNK> the cross country program starts later this month ."
""" we 'll have some <UNK> <UNK> , "" <UNK> said ."

"during track season , he had the <UNK> of <UNK> football star <UNK> <UNK> ."

""" he ( <UNK> ) has a great combination of strength and speed and determination , "" <UNK> said ."
""" he 's the most determined kid i 've had <UNK> this team . """
"the <UNK> and go ahead runs came off the bat of third <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , who <UNK> in extra <UNK> dan <UNK> and <UNK> tyler <UNK> ."
also scoring in the inning for peekskill was first <UNK> sean <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> chris <UNK> .
""" that was the kind of pitch i like , "" <UNK> said ."
"i was thinking i was going to get a hit the whole time . """
"unfortunately for peekskill , <UNK> pitcher john <UNK> settled down the rest of the way in a <#> - <#> victory for the visitors at peekskill stadium ."
""" he ( <UNK> ) started throwing <UNK> that kept us off balance , "" <UNK> said ."
"<UNK> and his <UNK> will be back at peekskill stadium wednesday , aug ."
"<#> and maybe even a day earlier , tuesday , aug ."
peekskill will look to get back on track then .

"the home team ran into a hot <UNK> in <UNK> pitcher jim <UNK> , who threw a complete game <#> - <UNK> ."
<UNK> george provided the highlight for peekskill in the sixth inning after striking out but getting on base by a wild pitch .
george then stole second and third base before scoring on a wild pitch .
"george and his <UNK> next home game is friday , aug ."
<#> at <#> p.m. mike <UNK> - <#> - <UNK>
is peekskill ’s <UNK> - under <UNK> <UNK> baseball association team .
"the <UNK> , sponsored by sound federal savings bank , were founded in <#> as the <UNK> <UNK> ."
they are the only original member of the <UNK> still in existence .
"since that time the team has also been known as the peekskill pirates , <UNK> <UNK> and now the <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> are made up of players from peekskill , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> and other northern <UNK> communities ."
"hilton armstrong , <#> peekskill high school graduate , is participating in this year ’s empire state games taking place in <UNK> university this weekend ."
both games were played at <UNK> university ’s east gym .
"armstrong <UNK> but didn’t score in hudson valley ’s <#> - <#> loss to <UNK> , played at <UNK> university ’s events center ."
"armstrong of course spent last winter , his sophomore season , playing for the <#> national champion <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> - <#> ) ."
"his personal highlight was grabbing a , team - high <#> <UNK> in a <#> - <#> triumph against <UNK> ."
that peekskill team was only the third in school history to make it to the state finals .
"when peekskill boys basketball coach lou <UNK> started the red devil basketball camp <#> years ago , they weren’t exactly lining up to get in ."
"“ it ’s the fact that the sport itself has become so popular over the years , ” said <UNK> of the popularity of the camp ."
“ our first year we only had <#> <UNK> and it took a good few years before we had any girls at all .
"” including both boys and girls , there should be over <#> participants at the camp according to <UNK> ."
"“ we don’t really do much advertising at all , ” <UNK> said ."
“ it ’s just word of mouth through the kids .
” the kids are ages <#> - <#> coming from the greater peekskill area .
"helping out as <UNK> are current and past red devil players , including hilton armstrong , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> jr ."
", who all played for the peekskill squad that made the state finals in <#> ."
"“ it ’s great to see them work with the young kids , ”"
“ they play at such a high level and yet are still able to get down to the kids level and teach them the <UNK> of the game .
” players coming back are <#> reason why the camp has become so popular .
"there are others , according to lou <UNK> ."
we’ve also been fortunate to have <UNK> stop by when he ’s available .
“ the kids receive good instruction and we put in fun type of games for the kids to play .
"” a typical day starts with <#> minutes of <UNK> , followed by playing a game , then a instruction of a specific skill , shooting for example ."
<UNK> will then play another game followed by a skills competition like a <UNK> contest . to those that think it sounds like fun and
"why wouldn’t it , it ’s not too late to call and join the camp ."
"for those interested , they can reach lou <UNK> at <#> - <#> - <#> ."
"there will be a press conference to announce the non - profit company camp inc . , which stands for <UNK> action model for peekskill ."
it was formed with the support of <UNK> brand .
<#> at <#> p.m. it was originally scheduled for aug .
the delay is because of the need to get all the equipment and furniture to the site .
"will be a learning and resource center for kids ages <#> - <#> at <#> bank street , right next to the peekskill health care center in downtown peekskill ."
there will be a <UNK> cutting ceremony which the whole community is invited to .
"it ’s not only the beginning for the nfl teams as the peekskill football team will start practice monday , aug ."
where our local teams will end up only time will tell but the <UNK> is the beginning of what everyone hopes is a great ride .
"for peekskill , the real thing will begin saturday , sept ."
those injuries ruined the season for both teams .
that ’s because if you don’t someone else is .
"to be honest , if a team ’s only <UNK> practice is during the summer , they are behind the <#> ball ."
"in high school football , thankfully there are no <UNK> games , though most teams will have a controlled <UNK> , usually the saturday before their first game ."
"a lot of times these <UNK> consist of <#> teams at <#> site , giving the schools a chance to go up against as many different <UNK> as possible ."
"it ’s common practice that teams will schedule <UNK> against teams that they are not scheduled to play in the regular season , for obvious reasons ."
what will be interesting to see from peekskill ’s point of view is if they can keep up the momentum after just missing out on the playoffs last season .
<#> good <UNK> usually is how many people will show up for that first practice .
"last season , peekskill had <#> players , more than its had in recent memory ."
he said that his team would be up for the challenge .
hopefully his players will feel the same way .
"judging by their play last season , it would seem that they will be ready to take on the challenge but only time will tell ."
the brand new peekskill stadium on <UNK> street has received rave reviews and <UNK> so .
it ’s great to see the people in peekskill take that pride in the stadium .
"however , to really see whether or not a place passes the test is when someone from the outside comes and plays on it and enjoys it ."
"<#> of those people is ryan murphy , who plays third base for the <UNK> <UNK> - under <UNK> <UNK> baseball association squad ."
"<#> . putting up good stats and winning was just half the fun for murphy , however ."
"in - between games of the <UNK> , murphy stood behind home plate and was asked about his experience of playing at peekskill stadium for the first time ."
"“ it ’s amazing , ” murphy said ."
“ it ’s like playing in a minor - league stadium .
"’s reaction won’t be the first time a visiting player sings the <UNK> of peekskill stadium , you can count on that ."
"last year , the jan peek <UNK> race and <#> - mile walk had <#> participants ."
"this year , that number almost <UNK> to <#> ."
"“ in the past , we have had conflicts with the <UNK> road runners club and their race , ”"
“ this year there was no conflict plus the club helped us to promote it .
"” the race , which took place aug ."
"<#> , was part of peekskill celebration weekend ."
"“ it was nice to see that many people show up , ” <UNK> said ."
<UNK> is hopeful that things can be just as good next year but certain things have to be done .

bob <UNK> won this year 's jan peek race in a time of <#> minutes and <#> seconds .
"this year 's event , held on aug . <#> as part of peekskill <UNK> weekend , drew <#> participants , almost <UNK> from last year ."
much more will be available on this site about the race tomorrow .
it ’s our great pleasure to have don <UNK> and his reports on the peekskill <UNK> league .
<UNK> has been doing these since the days of the peekskill <UNK> .
"his love for <UNK> is so great that , rob <UNK> <UNK> it in the july edition of the star ."
it seems as though most players were having a fairly good <UNK> percentage and <#> of them made the high - game honors .
"wolf <UNK> came in with <#> percent , don <UNK> <#> , <UNK> <UNK> <#> with mike <UNK> and ray <UNK> both tossing <#> ."
<UNK> home center defeated <UNK> ’s <#> - <#> with <UNK> ’s lone point coming in the “ a ” game .
john <UNK> <UNK> mike ryan <#> - <#> but <UNK> home center got the rest .
ray <UNK> won against tom <UNK> <#> - <#> and mike <UNK> slipped by jim <UNK> <#> - <#> .
mike ’s <UNK> also had a pretty good night with a <#> - <#> win over curry ’s funeral home .
<UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it out to the last shoe and <UNK> held his <#> - point spot in a <#> - <#> win .
bob <UNK> and ron page also went down to the wire with <UNK> winning it on the last <#> shoes <#> - <#> for curry ’s funeral home .
tom <UNK> beat bob <UNK> <#> - <#> to give mike ’s the win .
<UNK> ’s and <UNK> ’s split <#> - <#> with <UNK> taking the “ a ” and “ b ” games .
<UNK> <UNK> joe white <#> - <#> after <UNK> a <UNK> spot and dick <UNK> topped brian <UNK> <#> - <#> .
al <UNK> got <#> for <UNK> ’s with a <#> - <#> victory against fred <UNK> .
park <UNK> and <UNK> ’s house of printing also split <#> - <#> with wolf <UNK> beating brother bob <#> - <#> to give park <UNK> a point .
<UNK> ’s took the “ b ” and “ c ” with dave <UNK> beating al <UNK> <#> - <#> and frank <UNK> <UNK> jim <UNK> <#> - <#> .
"the home run was a mistake pitch , ” edwards said ."
i just left it too much over the plate and he hit it over the fence .
” edwards though was a completely different pitcher after the opening <UNK> .
"edwards struck out <#> and at <#> point , retired <#> in a row ."
", i found my release point and felt good on the <UNK> , ” edwards said ."
"” his <UNK> , mike anderson , explained how he was able to do so ."
"“ he was just hitting that outside corner all night long , ”"
"“ after the first , everything went smoothly . ”"
peekskill got back in the game when it scored twice in the third inning .
"ralph <UNK> and andrew <UNK> each had <UNK> singles , which drove in chris <UNK> and mike <UNK> ."
"“ i felt really good about keeping my team in the game , ” edwards said ."
“ after the first inning i was hitting every spot that he ( anderson ) put down .
my number <#> goal was to keep the team in the game .
” it was a game that saw peekskill have numerous chances but fell short in the aug .
"<UNK> pitcher ricky <UNK> struck out <#> and did a good job of getting out of <UNK> in peekskill ’s season finale , at least for the summer ."
"“ playing baseball this summer was a lot of fun , ” edwards said ."
“ i’m going to end up playing in the fall in the wood bat league ( for the peekskill entry in the <UNK> baseball association ) .
i hope they are all on the team in the fall . ” anderson <UNK> .
i had a good time and i can’t wait for us all to <UNK> in the fall .
"it was august but the weather made it feel more like a perfect , cool , september night at peekskill stadium ."
"the stadium was hosting the summer finale for peekskill ’s <UNK> - under baseball team , which fell to <UNK> <#> - <#> ."
the night was made extra special when mike <UNK> ’s <UNK> video and television production staff shot the game for local cable .
"when it comes to local television , <UNK> has been the man for many <UNK> and last night ’s game was no exception ."
calling the game for <UNK> ’s crew was joe <UNK> .
<UNK> has been calling various peekskill sporting events for years .
it was fitting that <UNK> was the first television <UNK> to call a game inside the new peekskill stadium press box .
"during the beginning of the game , he had on peekskill mayor john <UNK> ."
the end of the game saw <UNK> interview peekskill pitcher chris edwards and <UNK> mike anderson .
each of them enjoyed looking into the camera and talking about their baseball <UNK> .
<UNK> near the end of his broadcast said that he hoped that it would be the first many games <UNK> would <UNK> at the new field .
we hope so to because it adds a lot to the game when it ’s <UNK> .
"the game of basketball , like all other sports , has become so <UNK> today sometimes we forget what the basics of it are all about ."
"it ’s about <UNK> and shooting , like tyler <UNK> , <#> , did at the <UNK> brand clinic right next to the <UNK> building on john <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , shot and hit nothing but net , just like <#> of his <UNK> does on a <UNK> basis for the los angeles <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is <#> of my favorite players , ” said <UNK> on aug ."
i like how he shoots and the way he <UNK> .
” brand has held this clinic for <#> years now and it means a lot to a kid like <UNK> to take the time to do so .
"“ i really don’t know how to put it but it ’s special that he comes back for us , ” <UNK> said ."
"“ he ’s different because he ’s down to earth , ” said brian "" buck "" <UNK> , who has known him since his youth ."
when he was in peekskill a lot of people helped him get to where he is today and he didn’t forget that .
"” not only is brand interested in helping make the kids better basketball players , more importantly he wants them to do well in the classroom ."
"“ we saw their great interactive system , ” brand said ."
“ we thought maybe they would get involved with us .
we made a <UNK> ( $ <#> ) and they matched it .
this makes it possible for kids in kindergarten through fourth grade to get the interactive system .
it helps children with their reading and their learning overall .
” brand is involved in this because he has a sincere interest in seeing the youth of peekskill reaching their full potential in the classroom .
"“ i want the kids to have a future when they 're out of school , ” brand said ."
“ learning is the way to get to college .
“ i do this because i love the community here .
"when nba star <UNK> brand holds his basketball clinic in peekskill , many current and former peekskill red devils <UNK> and help him run it ."
"<#> of them was hilton armstrong , who was a member of this year ’s national championship <UNK> unit ."
"“ i can’t explain it , ” said armstrong , who is entering his junior year at the school in the <UNK> state ."
“ it ’s not something that you can put into words .
it was just a dream come true to win a national championship .
"” armstrong of course was a <UNK> on peekskill ’s <#> team that went to the state finals , only the third red devil squad to do so ."
he just wishes that they <UNK> won <#> more game .
"“ i wish we <UNK> won a state title when i was here , ”"
i like coming back here and helping anyway i can . ”
the los angeles <UNK> recently acquired guard kerry <UNK> from the new jersey <UNK> for a second round draft pick and cash <UNK> .
"“ we’re excited to have him , ” said <UNK> brand before his annual basketball clinic for the youth of peekskill on aug ."
“ kerry <UNK> is a big <UNK> and a veteran player who 's been to the finals twice .
he knows how to win and how to play the right way .
"in addition to <UNK> , the <UNK> should benefit from the experience of playing under coach mike <UNK> this past winter and having him back again this season ."
"<UNK> ’s <UNK> history includes <#> <UNK> appearances , a trip to the nba finals and a nba coach of the year award ."
"“ he ’s prepared for each and every game , ” brand said ."
i’m excited that we have a coach that can get us to the level where we can win .
” “ we want to get to the playoffs and get as far as we can .
our ultimate goal is to do what detroit did this year ( which was win an nba title ) .
"for those from <UNK> , give us a little bit of time and we’ll have plenty of stuff for you ."
today we’ll have a story on the <#> - time <UNK> volleyball champions from <UNK> hudson .
<#> we did a story on <UNK> <UNK> baseball player mike <UNK> and his role as <UNK> man on the peekskill <UNK> - under <UNK> <UNK> baseball association squad .
"as for those in peekskill , specifically my man don foster"
", the commitment to covering the red devils hasn’t changed , we’re just having more people at the party if you will , that ’s all ."
"matter of fact , i will be at the basketball <UNK> for the peekskill <UNK> league tomorrow ( friday , aug ."
"<#> ) at <#> p.m. at <UNK> park ( <UNK> if it rains ) . and rest assured , we won’t be expanding anytime soon ."
for <#> reason i’m just <#> person and <#> schools is about all i could handle .
"<UNK> i always wanted to add down the road and as you can see , down the road came about much more quickly than anticipated ."
"in addition to the school coverage , we will do <UNK> stuff time <UNK> ."
"obviously during the summer , we’ll have a lot more <UNK> coverage than during the school year ."
"however , we’ll do our best to do <UNK> things during the school year when possible ."
to win <#> <UNK> championship is quite an achievement .
"“ it ’s a combination of consistent <UNK> , i give <#> percent and the devotion of the kids , ” <UNK> <UNK> coach <UNK> <UNK> said ."
“ the kids work hard not only during the season but also during the <UNK> .
"they make sure that the kids get the proper sleep and are <UNK> athletes , because girls on the non - <UNK> list are not allowed to participate . ”"
"this season the <UNK> will start their quest for a fifth straight <UNK> championship tuesday , sept . <#> at 4:30 p.m. against <UNK> <UNK> ."
<UNK> <UNK> ’s next <#> matches will be at home at 4:30 p.m. against sleepy hollow ( sept . <#> ) and
"leading the <UNK> is senior <UNK> maggie wright , who was all - section a year ago ."
"“ she ’s the best <UNK> we’ve ever had at <UNK> <UNK> , ” <UNK> said ."
"“ now that i’ve said that , it will put a lot of pressure on her but she can handle it ."
"senior lauren <UNK> , junior <UNK> <UNK> and sophomore <UNK> <UNK> are other players that <UNK> will be looking to this season ."
"<UNK> also stressed the importance of the rest of team , from the top of the <UNK> to the bottom ."
"that ’s because without contributions from everyone , there would be no volleyball <UNK> in <UNK> ."
"for those looking for a great day of basketball , look no further than the <UNK> in the peekskill <UNK> basketball league ."
"the <UNK> will be held at <UNK> park friday , aug ."
"<#> at <#> p.m. in case of rain , they will be moved to <UNK> elementary school ."
"<#> <UNK> will be hosting <UNK> and they are <UNK> - under , <UNK> - under , <UNK> - under and <UNK> - under ."
the games are scheduled to be in that order .
<UNK> has run the league for the longest time and the success of the peekskill red devils is proof of what he does is something special .
"so those of you who want to catch a glimpse of the red devil future , the <UNK> at <UNK> park are the place to be ."
it was <#> hours before his first practice as coach of the peekskill football team but <UNK> murray was already to go .
"“ i’ve been waiting for this day since the end of last year , ” said murray on aug ."
“ i coach different sports ( he is also the varsity softball coach at peekskill ) but football is the reason why i got into <UNK> .
"” murray , who was an assistant on last year ’s team , was named head coach in june ."
"during the <UNK> , he was in charge of the red devils <UNK> program ."
"according to the first - year coach , <#> players participated in the program , <#> night a week , which started in january ."
murray expected players who weren’t at the time playing in a sport to participate .
even some players that were already playing a sport would come after practice to get their <UNK> in .
“ you just can’t show up in august and expect results .
” murray expects between <#> - <#> players on the varsity this fall .
he also is hopeful peekskill will field both a <UNK> and <UNK> team this year .
"last year , there was a <UNK> team but no <UNK> ."
"“ it ’s very important to have those teams , ” murray said ."
“ those kids are the future of the program .
it was very tough last year not having a <UNK> and essentially having to start from scratch .
“ having the <UNK> programs is vital because when they get to the varsity you just want to get right into everything without having to go over the basics .
“ last year we were a power - i team because we had a big line .
"“ however , we won’t have that this season so we’d like to spread the ball around the field some more this year . ”"
murray will get a better idea of where his team is headed aug .
"<#> at <#> a.m. when the red devils take part in a <#> - way <UNK> at <UNK> neck with <UNK> neck , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"“ the kids enjoy it , ” murray said ."
“ they look forward to going against someone else in a different uniform after going against their <UNK> in practice .
“ it ’s important for the <UNK> and players to see different teams and how you’re going to react to them .
"the peekskill red devils football squad is <UNK> to start practice today , probably inside according to coach <UNK> murray because of the <UNK> weather ."
"all other teams are allowed to begin practice wednesday , aug ."
volleyball has a coach with john <UNK> in charge and cross country with paul <UNK> running the show .
"however , girls swimming , boys soccer and girls tennis do n't have <UNK> as of this writing ."
""" we 're working on trying to fill those positions as we speak , "" said peekskill athletic director jim rose ."
""" a lot of schools are having trouble filling <UNK> positions . """
"there are a couple of reasons for this , according to rose ."
""" it 's a lot of time for a person to give up , more than it 's ever been , "" rose said ."
today is the day that all section <#> football teams are allowed to step on the field and start practice .
the red devils will have <#> weeks to prepare for their sept .
"<#> <UNK> , which is 1:30 p.m. at <UNK> ."
last year the <#> <UNK> played a game that was truly <#> of the most entertaining games ever played at <UNK> park .
"<UNK> <#> - <#> , peekskill made a wild <UNK> attempt , <UNK> the score at <#> before losing <#> - <#> ."
following that contest will be peekskill ’s home <UNK> sept .
last year peekskill defeated the <UNK> <#> - <#> at <UNK> <UNK> ’s homecoming .
the win for peekskill snapped a <#> - game winning streak in the series for the <UNK> and got the red devils headed in the right direction last fall .
<#> at 1:30 p.m. looking to <UNK> a <#> - <#> road loss to the <UNK> a year ago in its season finale .
the red devils will also be looking for <UNK> when they host <UNK> sept .
<#> at 7:30 p.m. to play defending new york state class a champion <UNK> .
<#> at 1:30 p.m. when it hosts spring valley .
this is another revenge game for peekskill as it looks to <UNK> for an <#> - <#> loss on the road a season ago .
"in that contest , peekskill ’s defense looked great but <UNK> in their own territory led to the loss ."
"after that , peekskill will either play <UNK> games or <#> more regular season games if it misses the <UNK> ."
those of us who write like to make everyone think that we come up with some great ideas with lots of hard work .
sometimes that 's the truth but other times it 's just dumb luck to be honest .
"for example , i was calling peekskill boys basketball lou <UNK> the other day about the opening of the camp inc ."
"it was a good thing i called , because the press conference for the grand opening was changed ."
there was another reason i was glad that i called .
it 's was because he told me about the red devil basketball camp which has been going on for <#> years now .
"of course , while it 's up to us writers to come up with the story ideas we always encourage people to get in contact with us ."
"so if you have a story idea , please let me know"
and i will try to <UNK> to the best of my ability .
"especially at this time of year , it helps a writer covering high <UNK> sports to get help wherever they can ."
<#> with everyone else going <#> days later so the ideas will be coming fast and furious to me before i know it .
"still , it ca n't ever hurt to get some help along the way so if you have an idea , call or e - mail me ."
i look forward to seeing everyone around this school year .
"ca n't wait to get my new dell laptop , coming soon ."
"then i will be able to going , <UNK> and <UNK> at <UNK> places ."
getting into going to <UNK> areas and relaxing .
good way to save money and have time pass .
"... however , <#> draw back was , the <UNK> ... next time need to be facing people , so i can see some eye candy !"
co and i went to <UNK> place and had a very productive time with <UNK> my computer to the <UNK> i wanted .
i think i will be going to <UNK> areas more often ...
i'm <UNK> a cyber person ... <UNK> ! ! <UNK> ! !
"ok , enough of that ... until next time ..."
have been going out way too much this week . must get back into working out and stop spending !
"will probably just hang out for a while , then <UNK> ."
"went to <UNK> karaoke , and it was a blast ."
"the boys came through and showed there support as usual , as well as the ladies , but the guest was a little late ."
my girl was singing up a storm and enjoying herself .
"however , gave me a little <UNK> at the end when i was talking to a female friend she never met ."
"got the hint , but enjoyed the talk ."
"i ca n't believe we drank that much on a work night , but we did it before so why not do it again ."
"need to have more nights like that , feeling of being free and not worrying of what anyone thinks ."
except for the residents that <UNK> later on that night because we were too loud in the parking lot .
the <UNK> had to come and tell us we had to leave .
"went to <UNK> softball friday , saw all my friends that i have n't seen in months ."
just another reason to drink and have fun .
"saturday , did the early lifting and lunch with co. after that was a slow day , party was cancelled , so did laundry ."
"sunday , <#> parties , only made it to <#> ..."
"missed the second party , fell asleep and woke up at <#> pm ."
not much happening at home or at work .
"boss has been physically here , but not mentally ."
my co - worker said when has the boss ever been mentally here !
"i 'm going to take a break this weekend and enjoy it with family and friends , also take monday off from the madness at work ."
monday 's always suck no matter where you are .
unless you have it off or take it off ... lol .
"i text this person and no reply , so told the person got the hint ."
later the person <UNK> and says did n't get the msg till <#> days later .
"i got text msg before that , same frickin system ."
"whatever , already ... cut this person out ... anyway , been hitting the gym this past weekend too ."
"feeling pretty sore , but it was a good burn ."
"<UNK> remember when we started , my max was <UNK> , i think his was <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is a good stress relief , other than drinking ."
it was nice of her and we <UNK> a little more .
we hardly <UNK> and when we do it 's more of just small talk .
last night had to do laundry ... looking for clothes that i want to wear only to be in the laundry bin .
took me the whole night after work doing the laundry and <UNK> it afterwards .
"had to fold , do n't like <UNK> so better to just hang it in the closet after the dryer ."
well this is the most i ever wrote ... will get back ... out !
"have you ever had someone call your <UNK> phone , home over <#> times to try to find where you are ?"
well i had a person do that the other night .
did n't even have my phone and the person is all upset .
ca n't talk with this person at all .
"now this person wo n't talk to me , for which i am pretty happy at this point ."
person just using me and taking me for granted .
"<#> message was going to ask me to do something , but then changed to , "" just call me ! """
"oh , well life would n't be fun without some drama in it ..."
"been keeping busy , went to company softball this past friday ... pretty fun and a lot of new pretty ladies ... woohoo ! !"
but have look at the eye candy or my babe will kick my butt ...
"took my advise and took a short , but sweet vacation ."
my girl and i visited the garden <UNK> of <UNK> .
visited family and friends and had a blast with the white sandy beaches .
"only spent a short time there , but it was so relaxing ."
family took us on a tour of the island and all the secret spots to relax and <UNK> .
"the sun , the white beaches , and not that much people to annoy you ."
"well to my friends we have to take another vacation ... somewhere , anywhere"
. have to get back to the job ... out !
"i mean , what do i care if it 's friday ? just the same as any other day to me ."
so yesterday we went to home depot and bought everything we need to clean and stain the fence .
"our "" plan "" is to clean it today and stain it tomorrow ."
"well , good thing the fence is n't going anywhere because it looks like our plans will change ."
"delay # <#> - nicholas got into an ant hill ( again ) while we were finishing up the "" in "" side of the fence ."
"it 's supposed to rain tomorrow , too ."
once we get past this cleaning stage i think it will be pretty easy .
"<UNK> the fence by hand is no fun , but it sure is making a difference !"
i will post some before & after pictures once it 's all done .
"my poor , ant - bitten baby is sleeping now ."
:( <#> more days until zach comes home !
i hope it does n't rain all weekend .
"whatever your weekend plans are , i hope you and your loved ones are happy , healthy , and safe . have a good <#> ."
"i have something that worries more than the fact that "" the <UNK> ) "" may be re - elected ."
"due to my <UNK> loyalty , i 've stayed with my small little credit union based in san francisco ."
they ask me about chicago everytime i call to check on something or order new checks .
there are exactly <#> atm 's in the entire chicago area that accept <UNK> to my account ( through some agreement with my credit union ) .
<#> of them is in <UNK> ( <UNK> of chicago ) and the other is on the 7th floor of marshall field 's state street <UNK> store .
"the past <#> weeks , the atm in <UNK> has been "" out of order "" ."
"so , i <UNK> my headphones into my ipod and headed towards the "" el "" to go down to the loop and deposit my check ."
"to get to and from the atm , i walk right through the men 's department , the <UNK> department , the kitchen department , and the <UNK> department ."
these are all very dangerous places for me to be right now .
<UNK> <UNK> has this very nasty way of treating its customers .
this is the second time this has happened to me .
this first time also co - <UNK> with a change in my usage plan .
<UNK> also has this habit of not allowing you to know how many minutes you have used for the entire month that you are in a new plan .
so i dropped my plan to <#> minutes to save $ <#> a month .
that cost me an extra $ <#> for the first month .
"realizing i 'd made a mistake i put it back , <UNK> me only $ <#> ."
"this would n't necessarily be a problem , but i work from home alot and need all the communications options i can get ."
i do n't know what i would do without that ! !
"in a different direction , i think it may be time for me to find a <UNK> ."
"not a sugar daddy , cause they would expect you to have sex with them ."
i 'm going to go for a walk down to the beach and watch the sunset over the city .
its been way too long since i 've spent time on the <UNK> .
i watched the democratic convention tonight and was totally blown away by <UNK> obama 's <UNK> .
i can honestly say that for the first time in <#> years i feel hope towards a brighter future .
i was in tears of relief at the end of his <UNK> .
it was such a relief to hear something hopeful after <#> years of fear - <UNK> and lies .
"whether "" the <UNK> "" lied or not is not even the point to this post ."
the very nature of all notices from the white house the past <#> years have been negative and fear filled .
"another <UNK> nation building "" <UNK> "" weapons of mass destruction ."
i would vote for obama for president after that <UNK> alone .
i 've added links and a quote that i stumbled across someplace on the web .
"oh yeah , and i found urllink this too.. not sure if its real or fake , but its funny , in a completely politically - incorrect manner ."
thanks to my friend at the <UNK> - bomb that encouraged me to start this .
its late so this will be a short entry .
i 've been up playing with html code for hours ... fun fun fun ...
( i wrote this a few weeks ago ) i have a well - earned respect for drug <UNK> .
the <UNK> <UNK> taking over the rear <UNK> had been covered with the <UNK> of a stack of stolen bumper stickers from an <UNK> <UNK> store in st .
the <UNK> screamed out “ <UNK> ” in bright orange and yellow .
it was from this car that i was crawling when she walked up to me and changed my life forever .
her name was “ <UNK> ” and she was a child of the night .
she had a small ring thru her <UNK> and was waving an <UNK> cigarette in my direction asking for a light .
i suggested the cigarette lighter in my car and off we went back to the car to help her get her <UNK> fix .
"once we had her cigarette lit , she firmly took hold of my arm and said in her unique and completely <UNK> way “"
"you 're adorable , come with me you have to meet my friends ” ."
"when <UNK> would speak , she spoke with an <UNK> that was not questioned for she believed her words with complete conviction ."
the <UNK> lounge was located upstairs towards the front of the club and was <UNK> by a serious looking drag <UNK> kid and the <UNK> velvet rope .
<UNK> was well known and just a nod of her head and the rope was pulled aside and we were <UNK> into the <UNK> of the inner <UNK> .
time melted away along with any <UNK> i had been hanging on to .
"i was a beautiful boy , full of life and wit ."
"i had enough energy to talk all night long , and that is exactly what i did for in another area of the <UNK> lounge"
there was a <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> around on the floor in front of it .
<UNK> and i had conversations of such depth and importance that we 'd missed the fact that the sun had <UNK> and the music had stopped .
"people had joined us for brief moments of an hour or <#> , until they would wander away to dance or further <UNK> their own <UNK> altered <UNK> ."
the people i met that night were unlike any i 'd ever seen in my life before .
i have alot going on in my life all the time .
"in my mind , i long for a time when i can sit in the sun on a rocking chair and read while sipping iced tea or homemade lemonade ."
i <UNK> memories of a long ago time that i 've never even experienced .
"a simpler time when you could trust the people around you , and leave your doors <UNK> ."
"where you know your neighbors and they look after your place while you 're traveling , <UNK> the lawn and collecting the mail so that your place looks <UNK> ."
"when i graduated college , i chose to move as far away from my family as i could ."
"i was less educated , less <UNK> , and less experienced than most people that i met ."
i was the little town boy that landed in the large city and hoped to fit in .
i lived in sf for over <#> years and i never truly felt at home .
"growing up gay in small town america , i <UNK> for the life in a big city where there were other people like me ."
"once i made it to big city life , i missed the slower pace and simpler life of the small town ."
i 've never really felt like i fit in .
so i 'll go on to the subject that the entry is titled ...

"urllink the <UNK> cave : : publishing settings this is my first post , bear with me as i am new to this ."
chapter <#> : out for a run it started as a late afternoon run on halloween .
<UNK> was running in the mountains a joy which he did everyday .
he had not been on that trail for a long time .
the <UNK> trail was not easy as the others he <UNK> .
this was the area you ran in when solitude was sought .
it was a cool day around <#> degrees or so .
as <UNK> reached the top of the trail it seemed to <UNK> out .
the trail led then left and back up into the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> forest .
as <UNK> was running in the forest he noticed that it was <UNK> here .
he thought nothing of it because only a few rays of sunlight <UNK> through the high <UNK> of the <UNK> .
"while running along at a good clip , something in his <UNK> vision caught his attention ."
<UNK> stopped and walked over to a shiny object laying on the ground .
the object seemed to be an <UNK> of some sort .
being curious in nature he <UNK> down and picked up the <UNK> .
"it was a silver <UNK> , with an <UNK> <UNK> and an image of <UNK> in the center ."
from watching countless horror movies he knew what this was .
<UNK> had also done his research on the subject via the internet .
he had found that this was a symbol of many <UNK> blood <UNK> .
this <UNK> had the traditional <UNK> goat on it .
but what was it doing out here obviously placed so that what little sunlight available would shine on it at a certain time of day ?
"halloween , <#> of the most important feast days to <UNK> . as he looked up"
", he saw there was a faint trail leading deeper into the dark woods ."
"it had not been traveled <UNK> , it was a freshly broken trail ."
"he needed to see what was going on , he had to investigate this further ."
"chapter <#> : the entrance as <UNK> <UNK> up the trail , slower than before , <UNK> the area closer for clues as to what was going on ."
if he was not an ex army ranger he would have had a tough time following the confusing trail .
but this and the fact that he was a <UNK> trail <UNK> led him to follow the trail <UNK> .
"as he was running along he thought of what could be going on up here in the <UNK> mountains , he had loved since he was a teenager ."
it was probably a bunch of goth kids pretending to be a cult .
"he saw them at the mall wearing all black , and lots of white face paint and dark <UNK> ."
pretending that they were dark and <UNK> on the evil path .
they were probably going to have a big halloween party far from others <UNK> eyes .
they were probably going to have a mock <UNK> and get drunk and high .
"as the trail continued on it 's left path , it <UNK> <UNK> ."
"the forest was very <UNK> here , <UNK> was definately getting close to the perfect spot if what they desired was privacy ."
then up ahead he saw what looked like a shadow on a rock face .
<UNK> slowed and walked over to the sheer rock wall .
there was a big <UNK> placed in front of the wall .
"through closer inspection of the <UNK> , he noticed that there was a small opening behind it in the rock wall ."
chapter <#> : into the <UNK> <UNK> had to check this out .
he was becoming chilled since he had slowed his pace for the last quarter of an hour .
he took the <UNK> gore - <UNK> jacket from his trail running pack .
he also put his knit hat on to keep his head warm .
<UNK> also removed his small white led <UNK> and <UNK> .
he put the knife in the pocket of his jacket and held the <UNK> with his left hand .
there was also the <UNK> sent of chemical lime .
mixed with an <UNK> scent of <UNK> and <UNK> .
what did these christmas <UNK> have to do with <UNK> flesh . as he was pondering
this thought he heard the faint sound of <UNK> chanting .
looking in the direction of the chanting he noticed dancing shadows of light on the <UNK> walls .
it looked as if they were coming from <UNK> or a <UNK> of flame deeper in the <UNK> of this <UNK> cave .
"<UNK> started to get nervous , and fear <UNK> him as a cold chill traveled down his spine ."
he also noticed that the had his knife out and already opened .
"he was taking no chances , when the smell of death was near ."
god knows what sort of <UNK> were down in this chamber .
as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deeper into the cave he could sense that he was going <UNK> .
there was still enough <UNK> light from the flames so he did not need his <UNK> yet .
then ahead of <UNK> there were a set of <UNK> <UNK> stairs .
if <UNK> stayed here above the stairs he could observe this strange meeting <UNK> .
he tried to <UNK> what was being said in these <UNK> .
"it was useless , as this was some long forgotten <UNK> language ."
it was <UNK> in nature such as in the german language .
but he had never heard anything like this in his life .
""" shit "" , he thought to himself what has he involved himself in here ?"
"<UNK> was much too strong for <UNK> though , he had to know what was going on ."
chapter <#> : welcome to the party looking around the chamber he could see many <UNK> figures .
as <UNK> <UNK> closer he counted roughly <#> <#> people there .
the high priest was up on a <UNK> roughly a few feet above the <UNK> cult .
there was a make shift alter which looked to be <UNK> .
"a smooth , shiny , black <UNK> laid across <#> huge rock <UNK> ."
"there was a large knife on the table along with a huge silver <UNK> , and a <UNK> ."
"the man was tall , roughly over <#> foot <#> ."
his <UNK> <UNK> as he was leading the <UNK> .
the priest was totally naked except for a huge black <UNK> head he wore .
this head piece went to the middle of his chest .
there were <UNK> symbols painted over the rest of his body .
"they looked like <UNK> , but they were of no origin that he had <UNK> of ."
"then as the chanting reached a <UNK> <UNK> , it stopped and there was complete silence ."
the only sound was that of the <UNK> of the wood as it burnt on the <UNK> .
and the <UNK> of the <UNK> on the <UNK> .
this was definately a ritual of <UNK> terror and horror .
"and it was just beginning to take shape chapter <#> : the main course suddenly in a blood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , the priest <UNK> out ."
"then from the left of the room <UNK> , heard a <UNK> sound and then a <UNK> scream ."
he looked to the left and saw <#> <UNK> <UNK> bringing a <UNK> woman <UNK> they were dragging her .
you could here her flesh <UNK> over the rough stone .
there was also the sound of the heavy chain <UNK> and <UNK> over the rock floor .
"she was <UNK> with them , crying , "" <UNK> .... <UNK> do n't hurt <UNK> ....."
"he also was smart he knew that all he had as a weapon was a lock blade <UNK> knife , and there were over <#> <UNK> here ."
"he had to be <UNK> and smart , if he was going to rescue her and stay alive ."
finally they had drug her to the alter where she was roughly and promptly <UNK> down with a big slippery <UNK> chain .
the priest then reached under the alter and <UNK> a large <UNK> tub .
it looked like a watering or feed <UNK> used on <UNK> .
"raising his arms he <UNK> "" we must now <UNK> the whore of <UNK> "" after saying this he left out a tremendous <UNK> <UNK> ."
the priest <UNK> down over the bowl and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> matter into the tub .
"it had the <UNK> sound of <UNK> , then <UNK> and <UNK> could smell the <UNK> <UNK> from his <UNK> point ."
"they lined up <#> by <#> filling it with <UNK> matter , urine , and vomit ."
"the smell of this was overwhelming , even from <#> feet away ."
then the <UNK> priest raised his knife and cut the woman across the chest .
the cut was deep enough to allow a steady stream of blood to run down her side .
it then <UNK> through the blood groove on the alter into the <UNK> mixture <UNK> in the tub below .
"the priest then <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> mouth , <UNK> to pour this <UNK> mixture down here throat ."
"he then <UNK> the remains of it on her body , seeming to wash or <UNK> her with this foul <UNK> ."
"the girl was <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time , she was choking on her own vomit ."
the priest then left out a bone chilling <UNK> of a laugh .
they were laughing and <UNK> and screaming with <UNK> .
chapter <#> : time to party <UNK> knew that now was the time to make his move .
he grabbed the <UNK> around the neck from behind and drug him back into the shadows from where he had come .
"he searched the body , and found a smith and <UNK> <#> <UNK> automatic <UNK> ."
it even was mag - na - <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> .
he searched the body a little more closely now .
this was not just any id it was a u.s .
<UNK> took the extra magazines off the dead agent .
<UNK> <UNK> the filthy <UNK> and prepared for combat .
he thought that he should strike now due to the general confusion going on .
"chapter <#> : the host reveals himself <UNK> down the stairs in <#> great bound , he hit the ground and rolled to his left up into a <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , bang , <UNK> , <UNK> , he was hitting the mark today ."
"as every bullet <UNK> into a body it , fell like ducks at a carnival ."
the crowd in their <UNK> did not react quick enough .
the priest did not notice he was too busy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the poor girls body .
then suddenly the priest was aware that the insane <UNK> was now silent .
"he slowly turned , only to see <#> lone person standing in the center of the chamber ."
this person was <UNK> with dead and dying bodies of his <UNK> congregation .
the man in the center of the chamber threw off his <UNK> <UNK> .
"it was <UNK> , standing there in his blood soaked gore - <UNK> running jacket ."
he had a <UNK> look to his cold gray eyes in the <UNK> .
the priest looked <UNK> around he knew there was no <#> there to help him .
"<UNK> shouted "" take off the fucking mask you piece of shit """
""" let 's see who the fuck you really are bitch "" ."
"the priest <UNK> back "" you will not harm me """
""" you shall bow to me worm "" as the priest said this he pulled off the heavy <UNK> head he was wearing ."
"it was the president of the united states , that was above him smiling his usual <UNK> grin "" you can not do anything"
it seems that the priest had disappeared into a tunnel and it was sealed behind him .
"she was a mass of blood , and <UNK> ."
he looked closer and realized that her <UNK> were pulled out of her <UNK> .
"he checked her <UNK> at her <UNK> , but realized sadly , that she was already dead ."
chapter <#> : the last mile to freedom <UNK> quickly ran out of this <UNK> horrid <UNK> .
as he cleared the <UNK> entrance he had noticed night had fallen .
he heard the <UNK> - <UNK> - <UNK> of <UNK> .
he looked up there were <UNK> <UNK> the area .
he had to make it across the open area ahead if he had any chance of <UNK> his <UNK> .
the <UNK> were not over the open area yet .
they were performing a <UNK> search back by the cave .
he knew he had just seconds if he was going to make it past the clearing .
<#> feet to go ... <#> feet to go ... ten feet ... <#> feet .... he made it he was back on the tree covered trail .
running at his fastest he wound down the trail .
he only had about a mile to go to get to his car .
when he reached his car he <UNK> the keys he had hidden in his usual spot .
he got into the car and started the engine .
<UNK> only had another sharp turn then he was home free .
he could hop on the <UNK> and be gone without a trace .
"there was a huge <UNK> , there had to be <#> state police cars there ."
he slowed to a stop . as he got out of the car
""" shit "" he <UNK> were coming this way ."
<UNK> the police <UNK> got into their cars and <UNK> the area .
<#> of the <UNK> <UNK> in a defensive position as the largest <#> began it 's <UNK> .
<UNK> as <UNK> and dust <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> wash .
the large <UNK> landed and shut off its engine .
the <UNK> was about <#> feet in front of him .
<UNK> noticed with horror the presidential seal on the side .
"suddenly from the <UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> of "" hail to the chief "" <UNK> ."
the door slid open and out emerged the president .
half an hour ago he was a <UNK> priest with fire in his eyes and that ever present <UNK> grin .
""" <UNK> ... .... "" the <UNK> .... .... .... .... ...."
"this , they claim , <UNK> their "" free speech "" rights ."
putting them in a single location <UNK> their freedom of speech .
"while i do n't mind them speaking their minds , i need to point out that the idea here is not to silence them ."
"yes , i know freedom of speech is guaranteed in the first amendment ."
"but i 'd like to know where in the constitution a "" right to be heard "" <UNK> ?"
"if these <UNK> want to make a point , they should simply make it ."
<UNK> themselves into the convention hall ( which is really what they want to do ) is not going to happen .
they have to think of alternative ways of making an impression . and
"if they ca n't ( or wo n't ) do that , i 'd have to conclude they have nothing to say worth hearing ."
<#> years later these <UNK> are still <UNK> on the same tune .
"whole bunch of 'em should just grow up . """
"for those who are opposed to gay marriage , for whatever reason , i 'd like to ask a question ."
"it 's a simple , innocent <#> , but its very simplicity may lead you <UNK> ."
"so i need to add <UNK> , after i ask it ."
"what is it about gay marriage , which will harm you ? ”"
"when he 's also a naturally gifted , highly <UNK> <UNK> ."
his name is <UNK> williams and he is an entering freshman at the university of miami .
the details can be found urllink here .
so this guy has been arrested <#> times in the past <#> years and was on <UNK> when he was <UNK> to miami .
so maybe he 's paid his <UNK> to society and has learned his lesson .
"everyone deserves a second chance , or in his case , an 11th chance , right ?"
"well , incredible as it may sound , while he was at the university of florida on a <UNK> visit , he had <#> complaints filed against him ."
"<#> for hitting a man in a bar , another for hugging a woman without her consent , and another for setting off <#> fire <UNK> in a hotel ."
and this guy was just admitted to the university of miami .
am i the only <#> who sees the <UNK> of this ? ?
so he 's <#> of the top high school football players in the country . because of this
", the university of miami is willing to ignore his considerably shady past so that he can play football for them ."
never mind that he 's got a rap sheet that <UNK> his football talent .
never mind that he caused all sorts of trouble on his <UNK> visit .
"hell , he can tackle people better than anyone else so screw all that other stuff ."
"oh , and it 's all <UNK> that he can play football ."
the university says that they will be watching him closely and will hold him to a higher academic standard than anyone else .
"he 'll probably get suspended for some games , then go right back playing football while his court case is <UNK> ."
"then at some point , the university will be forced to kick him off the football team and take away his scholarship ."
everyone is going to tell him how great he is .
"he 's going to have his <UNK> all around him <UNK> him more than any teacher , coach or counselor will ."
the guy is a train wreck waiting to happen . as a father
", it would scare the hell out of me to send my daughter to a place where someone like that could run into her at some party ."
well do n't discount it because it happens with more and more frequency these days .
"how many times have we seen news stories about young women at colleges getting drunk , being slipped a drug that <UNK> them out , and getting raped ."
"and the reality is that many incidents like this never get reported , so do n't think this is some isolated phenomenon ."
"so <UNK> williams , congratulations for being admitted into the university of miami ."
i 'm sure you 'll be a <UNK> out on the football field .
maybe you 'll prove me wrong and stay out of trouble during your time there .
the university will ultimately ditch you like yesterday 's meat <UNK> because that 's what you are to them .
welcome to the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> college football .
i consider hockey my favorite <UNK> sport over football and baseball .
"as i was saying , hockey is # <#> in my mind ."
you ca n't beat the excitement or the speed of good <UNK> hockey .
the sharks have for about half of their existence been a pretty pathetic team .
i believe they still hold the record for the worst season ever by an <UNK> team .
"we 're # <#> ! <#> seasons ago , they were supposed to be a serious <UNK> for the stanley cup ."
it started with several contract <UNK> that dragged into the beginning of the season .
then they got off to a terrible start and never recovered .
"soon , <UNK> <UNK> , their coach for <#> seasons , was fired ."
to top it all off the sharks did n't make the playoffs .
"it was a brutal , <UNK> season that for the first time made me question whether or not i should <UNK> my tickets ."
"my wife , being the voice of reason that she is , insisted <UNK> that we <UNK> ."
"bless her heart , it was a wise choice because last season the sharks had their best season ever ."
louis blues and colorado <UNK> in convincing fashion in the playoffs .
"the lone negative being <UNK> at the hands of the calgary flames , <UNK> by their ex - coach <UNK> <UNK> , in the conference finals ."
"a disappointing end to a magical season , but <#> that was the best i 've ever experienced ."
"so against this background , the upcoming season is <#> to look forward to ."
the <UNK> has been <UNK> under gm doug wilson and head coach ron wilson ( no relation ) .
"the team is young , athletic , very talented , and <UNK> to do great things ."
"well , the catch is that there may not be a next season ."
"the league 's collective <UNK> agreement <UNK> on september <#> and without a new <#> in place , there will be no hockey ."
"<UNK> talks about the league needing financial stability , which the player 's union <UNK> as a salary cap ."
"and they wo n't accept a hard cap , like there is in football ."
"now , as the average fan , it 's a little hard for me to <UNK> with guys who make millions of dollars ."
"i do n't doubt that the owners are losing millions of dollars , as they claim ."
player <UNK> are getting near ridiculous levels and the <UNK> does n't have the <UNK> of a <UNK> television contract .
"in fact , their tv deal is downright pathetic ."
"the revenue from tv comes to about <#> <#> dollars per team , which is barely enough to pay for <#> mid - level free agent 's salary ."
"when the <UNK> comes , and it will come , we can essentially thank <#> person : <UNK> <UNK> gary <UNK> ."
it was when football and baseball went on strike .
"as a fan , i could n't care less ."
talking about that much money is foreign to me .
all i know is that <UNK> and lack of <UNK> is going to destroy whatever <UNK> of <UNK> exists between the league and the fans .
"both sides have known about this situation for well over a year , yet they 've put off talks until essentially the last minute ."
only in the past week or so have the <#> sides agreed to sit down and have substantial talks .
major league baseball went through a strike almost <#> years ago that nearly destroyed the game .
it took years and a magical run by mark <UNK> and sammy <UNK> for the home run record to bring fans back to the game .
i fear that hockey will suffer the same thing .
a long <UNK> <UNK> will do nothing but destroy <UNK> with the fans .
i do n't know how this will affect the sharks .
it 's a shame that a team on the verge of great things will be stopped by something so ridiculous .
the frustrating thing is that the fans are the ones who really get the <UNK> .
all we can do is just sit back and hope the <#> sides can get a deal done .
too bad all these rich guys ca n't see that .
"yet there are things about her that scare me , like her eating habits ."
she 's a <UNK> woman at just a hair under <#> feet .
what 's unusual is that she eats about as much as it would take to <UNK> a small bird .
"me , i start to <UNK> if i miss a meal . going to buffet places"
"is out of the question because in that scenario , the house wins with her ."
", whenever we go out to eat , her favorite <UNK> is to suggest that we order something to share ."
she 'll skip meals at work because she is too busy .
"okay , i 've done that a few times ."
she 'll also skip meals if she is too tired .
"hmmm , maybe you 're too tired because you have n't eaten anything ."
i 'm sorry but that 's not a full meal .
"when she was pregnant , it scared me that she might skip meals , which is not exactly healthy for the baby ."
"with the volume of food she eats , she should be about <#> pounds and built like an <UNK> <UNK> sister ."
"me , i 'll just keep feeding my fat ass to keep from passing out ."
"last week , i saw the last samurai on dvd ."
"almost everyone has a guilty pleasure and mine is <UNK> ( and hudson hawk , but that 's another story ) ."
it has enough t and a to <UNK> even the <UNK> teenage boy .
"maybe it 's because <UNK> is <#> of the most ridiculous , <UNK> , loud , obnoxious , and <UNK> movies ever released ."
i already own the original dvd release that came out several years ago .
"so , i was pretty excited several months ago when i heard that there would be a special edition coming out ."
"not just a special edition , but a <UNK> special edition ."
"anyhow , this <UNK> treasure was in - store yesterday ( july <#> ) and of course i headed to the local best buy to pick it up ."
"yes , i actually bought it and was n't ashamed to be seen carrying it up to the cashier ."
"actually , she seemed more interested in playing with the baby ."
"okay , suffice to say i would be watching the movie by myself ."
i settled down late in the evening in anticipation of the <UNK>
"now for those people out there who have n't seen <UNK> , and there are a lot of you , the plot is <UNK> simple ."
it 's a <UNK> to <UNK> to <UNK> story about a young ambitious girl who wants to be a star in the <UNK> <UNK> of las vegas .
"hell , it even has a scene with trained monkeys ."
"my wife and i have this running joke that if a movie has any sort of scene with chickens in it , the movie has to be good ."
"chickens are <#> thing , but having trained monkeys in a movie takes it straight into the <UNK> of movie greatness ."
"watching <UNK> , <#> has to acknowledge the special effort put forth by elizabeth <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> , our <UNK> <UNK> turned "" dancer "" ."
"before <UNK> , i knew about <UNK> from the old kids show , saved by the bell ."
"she was pretty cute on that show , but in a <UNK> sort of way ."
to describe her acting in the movie to someone who has never seen it before is pretty <UNK> .
"every movement , every line , every smile , every dance step is done with no <UNK> at all ."
"it 's like being given the most aggressive lap dance you 've ever had , not that i 've ever done anything like that ( ha ! ) ."
the infamous sex scene in the pool deserves special mention .
<UNK> gets it on with kyle <UNK> in a way i can only describe as a <UNK> with an <UNK> <UNK> .
"paul <UNK> , who fought tooth and nail to get <UNK> made , went on to do <UNK> <UNK> and hollow man ."
"not the best track record , but at least it 's work ."
kyle <UNK> went on to do mostly tv stuff .
"gina <UNK> went on to do many other movies including the excellent bound , directed by the <UNK> brothers , before they hit it big with the matrix ."
the <#> guy who seems to have gone down the toilet career - wise is joe <UNK> who wrote the <UNK> for <UNK> .
i guess hollywood did n't exactly agree with joe 's ideas of what is <UNK> in movies .
"it must be hard being a <UNK> , <UNK> , woman - hating bastard writer in hollywood ."
i actually started out watching it with the regular audio track ( in glorious <UNK> digital <#> sound ) .
"about <#> minutes into it , i was curious about the audio commentary track included"
"unfortunately , the commentary was not done by paul <UNK> or joe <UNK> ."
i would have loved to hear their serious take on their masterpiece .
"instead , the commentary track is done by some <UNK> - fan of the movie ."
what makes it enjoyable though is that the guy throws out comments and <#> - <UNK> that make it sound like an episode of mystery science theater <#> .
there 's some great funny stuff in the commentary and it makes an already classic movie even more enjoyable .
"so at <#> am after finishing the <UNK> <UNK> , i sat there wondering what was it about that movie that i like so much ."
i guess i like <UNK> because it 's made so badly that i 'm constantly amazed that it takes itself so seriously .
"that , my friends , is quality <UNK> ."
i just hope my daughter never gets any crazy ideas about running away to vegas to become a <UNK> .
<#> of the coolest things about the ' net is that you can meet just about anyone online .

"come to think of it , it was almost yesterday ."
"so , yes is coming back to the bay area on sept ."
"now , if you 've ever purchased tickets online , you usually deal with either <UNK> or <UNK> ( the old bass tickets outfit ) ."
"the <UNK> website works for the most part , even when they 're being <UNK> by people buying tickets ."
"with either , you end up paying the "" convenience fee "" which seems more like <UNK> ."
"i 've never had problems with <UNK> or <UNK> although i always <UNK> about how much the "" convenience fees "" are ."
"kennedy and i are interested in the lowest cost package , <UNK> named the bronze package ."
"kind of expensive but hey , we 're fans ."
the other packages include other stuff like t - shirts and something about being able to meet the band in person .
"of course , the prices are out of this world too ."
"sorry , but the thought of meeting the band while surrounded by some of the more scary hardcore yes fans is something i will pass on ."
watching overweight <UNK> women wearing <UNK> pants and t - shirts <UNK> with pictures of the band hitting on chris <UNK> scares me .
the image of <UNK> in <UNK> alone is enough .
"so , the tickets went on sale today at <#> am sharp ."
i figured that the site will be slow since everyone will be trying to buy their tickets online at the same time .
what i did n't figure is that it would be really slow .
so slow that it <UNK> out to an error page twice during my <UNK> .
"the second time , when it was trying to process the credit card information ."
"on top of that wonderful experience , you are not allowed to select how many tickets you want to buy ."
you 're allowed to buy <#> and only <#> at a time .
kind of sucks if you want to buy <#> tickets .
at no time during the entire process do you find out where your seats are .
"we could be in row <#> , but we wo n't know until the tickets are delivered and in my hands ."
"you buy them and if you do n't like the seat location for whatever reason , tough luck ."
"<UNK> must have their website running on a <UNK> ii running <UNK> , with an <UNK> line ."
here 's a thought : try using modern servers and provide <UNK> <UNK> so that customers do n't bust a gut trying to buy something on your <UNK> system .
"i never thought i would ever say this , but i appreciate <UNK> now ."
here it is 3:30 am and i 'm wide awake .
"for all the <UNK> a baby shows you , there is the flip side of caring for an infant ."
"the sleep part is the tricky thing because unlike adults and older children for that matter , babies wake up in the middle of the night ."
"right now , my girl <UNK> is waking once during the night , usually around <#> am ."
i am not a morning person at all so these <UNK> are tough .
you 're sleeping when all of a sudden you hear the baby crying over the monitor .
it 's a sensation not unlike getting a bucket of cold water thrown on you .
so you jump out of bed and stumble your way to the baby 's room .
"change the <UNK> full of pee , or toxic poo if you 're really lucky ."
return to the baby 's room and settle in for the feeding .
"half an hour later , you 're pretty much awake ."
you put the baby back in the crib and <UNK> your way back into bed .
my problem is that i either just stay up all the way to <#> am and the kid 's feeding session .
"or , i go to sleep early , wake up at <#> , do the routine , and then ca n't fall back asleep ."
"when the baby is <UNK> , it 's even worse ."
"the first month of the baby 's life , it wakes up every <#> or <#> hours ."
"i know this happens to a lot of parents , but there was a time after a couple of weeks where i literally had a breakdown ."
you are sleep deprived for so long that it starts to really affect your mental state .
"when you 're expecting a child , all your friends who already have kids pretty much tell you the same thing ."
"of course , poetic justice being what it is , the <UNK> i write this , the baby has , so far , slept through the night ."
"for some unknown reason , everyone tells you to make sure you take a <UNK> class ."
"yet , during the actual birth , no <#> ever uses the <UNK> technique ."
do n't spend too much money on baby clothes .
because everybody and their mother will be giving you baby clothes as a present .
"also , <UNK> grow out of their clothes incredibly fast ."
"if you have too much , the baby may wear a given outfit literally once before he/she ca n't fit in it any longer ."
"that being said , buying baby clothes is a blast ."
"there are so many cute outfits to dress the baby in , especially for little girls ."
"<#> . after the baby is born , do n't wait until the day you leave the hospital to learn how to install the baby car seat ."
"seems like a no - <UNK> , but it happens a lot ."
those seats are not easy to figure out in a couple of minutes .
"after the baby is born , it seems to get harder to communicate with your <UNK> ."
everything concerning the baby becomes a big production that requires in - depth discussion .
"guy will be guys and just kind of assume things , while the women have to practically chair a <UNK> hearing on stuff ."
"if you are lucky enough to have family and relatives who offer to take care of the baby , never turn down that offer ."
that allows mom and dad to go do other stuff without worrying about bringing the baby .
new parents need to occasionally take a short break for themselves .
anything to get your mind focused on something other than the baby .
"i 'm sure there 's more , but incredibly enough , i 'm getting sleepy ."
anyone who knows me knows that i love movies .
"it 's been so long since i actually counted how many titles i have , but it has to be over <#> ."
"i have n't stepped foot in a blockbuster video in something like <#> years , and i cut up my blockbuster card years ago ."
"a <UNK> show is $ <#> a ticket , so $ <#> for <#> ."
"on top of that you get the privilege of getting in a car , driving to the theater , finding a parking spot and dealing with the crowds ."
now you know why i have over <#> dvds .
of course it helps to have a home theater setup .
"speaking of which , i finally saw tom cruise 's the last samurai ."
"it 's been <#> of those titles sitting in my "" to watch "" pile for what seems like forever ."
i like tom cruise ( i feel the need .
"so , last samurai is right up my alley ."
it has a very <UNK> view of the old world vs. the new world .
"what <UNK> the plot <UNK> , it made up for with the spectacular <UNK> ."
the japanese <UNK> is gorgeous and makes me want to move there and be a farmer .
it also is a portrait of japan during the <UNK> era where the entire country struggled with its identity .
"on the <#> hand , japan has followed the samurai code for thousands of years ."
"now , it wants to join the industrial powers of the world which mean <UNK> western ideas and technology , often in direct contrast with the old ways ."
"so while the movie is good overall , some things bothered me ."
"we have yet another movie set in a distant land telling the story of other cultures , yet the film centers around a white male ."
"once , just once , it would be nice to see a film like this center around a hero who is n't your usual white dude ."
"you have movies like <UNK> , come see the paradise , <#> pieces of gold ."
"heck , even joy luck club has a white guy ."
the white guy always gets the hot asian girl .
another <UNK> aspect of the last samurai is that our hero lives in the end .
this after <UNK> a <UNK> of a battle where he is literally the only survivor .
"actually , the main samurai lives , but good ol ' tom helps him fulfill his honor by helping the guy commit <UNK> ."
there is no reason why tom cruise 's character should live .
it would have made a more powerful statement if he had died with everyone else at the battlefield .
his whole purpose at the end was to finally give the emperor a clue that he 's been a right bastard selling out his country .
a white guy showing the <UNK> japanese emperor that he 's selling his soul to the white race .
"the end almost <UNK> the rest of the movie , it was so <UNK> ."
"with all the <UNK> i have of the movie , i still found last samurai to be very entertaining ."
the fight scenes and the big <#> sided battle at the end were technically well done .
tom cruise was <UNK> as our hero and ken <UNK> as the <UNK> samurai is excellent .
i can see why he was nominated for an academy award .
"his role was unique in that he played a very <UNK> , powerful asian male ."
"the lone female character , played by the <UNK> named <UNK> , is pretty much there as window dressing ."
i give it <#> out of a possible <#> <UNK> .
"really though , it came as a moment of inspiration motivated by the blog of <#> urllink bill harris ."
"he does n't know it , but he is my idol ."
he also seems like the kind of guy i can sit out in the backyard and have a beer and bbq with .
maybe if he ever sees this he 'll invite me .
"i hope my random writings are as humorous , witty and entertaining as bill 's ."
jimmy the fish is my screen name at the san jose sharks <UNK> urllink <UNK> .
it sounds vaguely mob - ish and fits in with the <UNK> nature of sharks and fish and all that .
"it 's a lot more creative than calling myself <UNK> or god forbid , my real name ."
"out of all <UNK> sports , hockey is my favorite , and the sharks are my team ."
"as a child of the <#> 's , van <UNK> is <#> of those bands i recall <UNK> during my high school years ."
"being the deprived child i was in those days , i never got to go to any concerts , let alone a van <UNK> concert ."
"oh sure there was the fleeting failed attempt at a reunion with david lee <UNK> , as announced on the mtv music awards not too long ago ."
rumors became fact as the band announced the upcoming release of a <#> disc greatest hits collection and a summer tour .
"needless to say , i would be all over tickets for the show ."
i did n't care that they were nearly $ <#> a ticket .
a band i never thought i would see in person . so fast forward to august <#> .
my old high school buddy and i were really looking forward to this .
"sure the band is a "" little "" older but this was still van <UNK> ."
"and yes , i do count the <UNK> era as true van <UNK> , despite what some david lee <UNK> fans think ."
"from the opening song , jump , to the finale , when it 's love , it was a loud and interesting show ."
alex van <UNK> ( drums ) appears not to have aged <#> bit since <#> .
"eddie van <UNK> on the other hand , has not been treated kindly by the progress of time ."
"thin as a crack addict , he barely moved around on stage ."
"i recall he jumped a couple of time on jump , but that was as animated as he got ."
"<UNK> , he 's been a wreck over the years , <UNK> throat cancer and having hip replacement surgery ."
"luckily for him , his hands have remained intact ."
"eddie has , and always will be a guitar god ."
"during his <#> minute guitar solo , he reminded everyone of this fact ."
"sadly though , the <UNK> of life as a rock and roll star appear to be taking its toll ."
"sure it was still <UNK> eddie , but there was something that was not quite right ."
"it 's hard to describe , but his guitar playing did n't sound as clean as i expected ."
"yet , in spite of the <UNK> eddie displayed and the constant reminder that these guys are all pushing <#> , it was a night to remember ."
i fulfilled a wish i never thought i would ever see happen . to be able to hear my favorite songs live :
"dreams , <UNK> , <UNK> , best of both worlds , right now , <UNK> , was something meaningful to me ."
"several times during the show , i was taken back to my high school years and reminded of some great memories ."
i 've read some reviews of the concert in some of the local newspapers .
"all i know is that for <#> night , i was back in high school again , and it felt great ."
"my first reaction was "" what the hell ? "" ."
"we had a little <UNK> this morning over something insignificant , but it was enough to put us both in a bad mood going out the door for work ."
"so , imagine my surprise when the <UNK> in the lobby called to tell me i had a delivery , and there they were ."
"a big <UNK> of flowers , in a pink <UNK> no less ."
"now , when you send your <UNK> flowers at work , you , as the guy , feel pretty cool ."
"when guys receive flowers at work , you grab them and run back to your desk in the desperate hope that no <#> sees you ."
"first of all , you have to answer the <UNK> <UNK> 's questions : "" who are they from ? """
"you escape <UNK> in the halls and now you 're back to your desk , only there is no place to hide the flowers ."
it 's not like being able to proudly display your favorite action figure that you can bend in all sorts of <UNK> <UNK> .
good luck at the end of the day when you try to sneak them all the way to your car to go home .
i think the wife and i have to have a little talk after work about this .
penalty for such action can result in <UNK> of the official man card and <UNK> no more than <#> months from such time .
"chances are , the answer is ' no ' ."
"<#> of the best bands in existence , that 's who ."
"for me , every new iq release is a major event ."
"in my opinion , music these days is a vast <UNK> of crap ."
"maybe it 's my old age , but back in the day when i was but a boy , music in the <#> 's was music ."
i just do n't get the music kids listen to today . especially rap .
"someone needs to explain to me the "" genius "" of <UNK> ."
all i see is a white trash punk who beats up his wife and talks crap about his mom .
"in any case , being a progressive rock fan is like being a <UNK> ."
<UNK> rock seems to become <UNK> more and more as time passes .
it wo n't be long when the more mainstream <UNK> bands will literally die off .
how much longer is yes going to be around ?
you get the feeling that the end is near for a band like rush .
"<UNK> , another of my favorite bands , is less of a <UNK> band and more of ... i'm not sure what they are ."
they 've gone off in different directions <UNK> that it 's hard to <UNK> what they are really .
"their latest release , <UNK> , does give me hope though ."
i was introduced to iq 's music by my friend back in <#> when they <UNK> for ever .
i had no <UNK> with any of their music other than ever and the show we went to was a near religious experience for me .
"needless to say , i went out and bought the rest of their cds ."
for the most part every iq release has been a masterpiece .
"for <#> albums , the band <UNK> into a bizarre <#> 's pop band singing happy songs ."
"it 's akin to genesis when peter gabriel left and was replaced by phil <UNK> , only worse ."
"exit <UNK> progressive rock band , enter cheesy pop band ."
"so , the latest iq cd is out and i got myself a copy ."
"after listening to it , my impression is ... meh ."
a little short but still brilliant in its own way .
"sadly , dark matter is a different ... matter altogether ."
"for a band that regularly <UNK> epic songs in excess of <#> minutes , a <#> minute cd is shocking ."
but even more shocking is the fact that the songs are boring .
there is a distinct lack of complexity in their musical arrangement and a total lack of complex <UNK> .
they start building on some good stuff and then cut it short .
"the <UNK> of the cd , a <#> minute epic song , was , for the first time that i can remember , actually boring ."
"the <UNK> , dramatic <UNK> <UNK> which i love are missing and the ones that are there just do n't grab me the way that they usually do ."
i write this as a first impression after giving dark matter a good listen .
"to me iq has always been the type of band where i know that i 'm going to get excellent quality , memorable songs ."
"for the first time , they let me down ."
maybe i need to listen to it some more to see if it will grow on me .
"i really hope it grabs me the more i listen to it , but i have a feeling that it will not ."
"for the first time , i 'm wondering if this is a hint of things to come ."
or is this just a once in a lifetime <UNK> ?
"urllink the new breed -- "" kerry republicans ! """
"i gotta say , i do n't know how rush did it ."
i have been <UNK> out for the last few days on legal drugs trying to get over a bad cold .
"the medicine has me so <UNK> , i can barely even think about politics or whatnot ."
"i had to <UNK> the last night of the <UNK> convention , and bill <UNK> ."
"will watch , and offer my commentary , as soon as i 'm back at <#> % ."
urllink woman 's dying wish : bush defeated ; let 's see if we ca n't grant her final request
urllink bill <UNK> is back ! ' real time with bill <UNK> ' back on <UNK> tonight at <#> pm ( est )
i do n't know whether to be happy or cry .
sometimes weekends are just too hard to go through .
it 's nothing but <#> big fight with myself to stay on my <UNK> ( healthy eating plan ) .
that word just brings up too many bad memories .
"like being on <UNK> in high school and having to sit in the basement eating my bowl of tuna with carrots and <UNK> mushrooms , no <UNK> or anything ."
i tried eating some tuna the other day without <UNK> .
""" you 're to fat to eat with the rest of the family . """
"let 's try another color , shall we ?"
"not sad , not gay , just a little blue ."
i feel more powerful this week after being op the entire time .
i also feel powerful because i need to do some home improvement projects this weekend .
"green , kinda green today . filling up on veggies and fruit ."
had a great supper last night with <UNK> fresh <UNK> and summer squash .
going to have tuna sandwich tonight with fresh tomatoes .
"brown on monday , cause i 'll probably be bruised after this work i 'm planning to do ."
i like being able to take care of myself and not have to call someone or pay someone to fix things .
plus the home improvement store can be a great place to meet guys ! ! ! !
"trying hard not to put work stuff up here because nobody is interested , not even me ;) had <UNK> pop in for a flying visit and <UNK> ."
"not sure why she keeps coming over , she 's so annoying ;)"
"this weekend is looking busy , working all day then going to he jam 's birthday <UNK> ."
i think i 'm also supposed to pop around to kim 's to see off <UNK> and mikey on their tour de <UNK> .
also the current plan is to pop down to the parental home to do some it support and drop off some cash . but
that all depends on how much i work and drink on saturday :)
"my , my , how you 've grown , little blog !"
"you 've <UNK> your size overnight , from <#> entry to <#> ."
"today i thought i 'd write about the family reunion i just returned from at <UNK> of <UNK> , south carolina ."
"i got to see older cousins and siblings i seldom see , as well as their <UNK> <UNK> , children , girlfriends , and dogs ."
everyone except for the <#> - year - old slept late and no <#> kept a schedule .
those who wanted to <UNK> like mad and the rest did n't .
the highlight of the event had to be sunday afternoon when everybody gathered for a group portrait .
"( hope somebody had a wide angle lens ! ) at max , we had about <#> people in the house ."
"when we are small , we believe our parents are immortal , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
we reject our parents ( or at least pretend to ) .
"in teenage ignorance and arrogance , we assume our parents do n't know anything ."
we just have to do the best we can with what we 've got .
"once <UNK> i was <#> , i thought my father did n't know anything ."
"when i was <#> , i was amazed at how much the old man had learned in <#> years ."
someone who 's trying to do his best despite his weaknesses is ultimately more <UNK> and <UNK> than those seemingly perfect <UNK> of our childhood anyway .
"there are <UNK> on both sides of the fence , and i think they are equally insane ."
"somewhere in the middle is reality , and <UNK> , and compassion , which is what jesus was all about ."
"he was not all about <UNK> pain and suffering on anyone , least of all an unwanted child ."
he was also not in favor of killing people to prevent them from performing medical procedures .
and <UNK> lies the <UNK> : is abortion a sin ?
"is it murder , like the right to <UNK> would have you believe , or is it the same as removing a <UNK> <UNK> ?"
i rather doubt that either of these is truth .
"first of all , a <UNK> of skin is not going to get in your face and cry or yell about being removed ."
"and no woman is proud to have had an abortion , i do n't care what they tell you ."
"when they look you in the eye and tell you that it is not a child , anyway , they are lying ! to you , and to themselves ."
"still , i would not tell them that if there is absolutely no way out of the situation they are in , they still can not get an abortion ."
"they would just go get <#> anyway , through some other means , possibly <UNK> themselves , or worse yet , taking <#> lives instead of <#> ."
"so , abortion may not be <UNK> , or <UNK> , but it should be available ."
"and with that said , an opportunity for some <UNK> comes up ."
"again , so called christians fail miserably at this ."
", they are forgiven , and they are loved ."
"if you have had an abortion and need help , seek out the heart ministry ."
you need the <UNK> and the spiritual assessment of the situation .
"and if you have <UNK> with the subject , and decided to see the pregnancy through to term , good for you !"
here is the dilemma : jesus says that you are forgiven for your sins .
"he also says that if you do not <UNK> , you ca n't get into heaven ."
you ca n't enter heaven unless you have the faith of a child .
"have you ever told a child "" no "" and had them listen to after just <#> time ?"
"how many times have you said "" no "" ?"
""" is like putting a drop of water on a <UNK> <UNK> and telling it not to absorb it ."
"if it were possible for a human to live like jesus <UNK> us we should live , what would we need jesus for ?"
"it does mean that if you fall , jesus will pick you up ."
"if you fail , jesus will fix it for you ."
"in fact , it is already fixed , and you have already been picked up ."
"he just asks you to recognize it , and it is so ."
the art of <UNK> selling means that you ask a customer if they want anything else after they have already told you exactly what they wanted .
"if you go to home depot , they ask if you need any <UNK> to go with your <UNK> pressure <UNK> ."
"and of course , at mcdonald 's , no matter what you have ordered , they ask if you want fries ."
of course the idea is to <UNK> just a little bit more money from you .
"it is only <#> cents , after all , or only another $ <#> !"
it is so easy to give in to suggest sales .
consider my previous post about the <#> <UNK> <UNK> .
you can find heaven in a mcdonald 's though .
"anything on the menu is yours , if you ask and pay the price ."
"all you have to do is ask , and you will receive god 's blessings in abundance . and fortunately for you , jesus already paid the price ."
the little fish on the back of every good christian 's car . or how about the bumper stickers ?
"i have a real problem with the rest of them . """
""" you can bet your life he would n't spend his money on bumper stickers <UNK> his faith ."
"much to the contrary , he 'd keep it to himself , except to go forth and minister to those who needed it ."
"now , i know its ok to be excited about something you are involved in ."
"i 've got <UNK> bumper stickers on my truck , and support them every sunday they are in town ."
"and that is really all the bumper stickers and little <UNK> are , a way to say "" i am excited about my faith "" ."
but they do expose people a little too much .
"then , the <UNK> <UNK> in with their <UNK> <UNK> ."
so some christian gets offended and <#> - ups the atheist with a truth fish eating the <UNK> .
"i like to think of jesus as being the answer when <UNK> - wan 's instructor says , "" there 's always a bigger fish . """
"i can hear jesus saying , "" do n't waste your money on buying things to show me what a good christian you are !"
"buy that homeless guy a hot bowl of soup , or put him up in a hotel for the night ."
"sit down and <UNK> with him , and tell him what i am all about ."
"then i will know you are sincere . """
you do n't have to go around eating up <UNK> with your truth fish .
"instead , why not take them out for some seafood ?"
my friend <UNK> came back from <UNK> looking tan and gorgeous .
decided to go to the movies with gina and <UNK> to see fahrenheit <#> .
"i had heard of <UNK> , but knew very little about it ."
"i <UNK> it up when i got home and came up with urllink this video , originally broadcast on <UNK> <UNK> tv ."
this stuff is enough to keep you up at night .
"anyway we agreed , i think , that you can only use so much money ."
why do so many people put so much energy and <UNK> effort into making more than they could ever spend ?
"i can not imagine becoming so <UNK> that i could feel comfortable with the knowledge that i was <UNK> or <UNK> anyone , never mind everyone ."
"of course , i have my own plans for world <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> is n't quite complete , but it has something to do with casting spells with chocolate ."
michael moore documents the research for his claims urllink here .
"he definitely has his point of view , and he 's passionate about it , but his research seems <UNK> ."
i spend the afternoon watching the <UNK> give away the game to arizona .
"i love those guys , but they can <UNK> the hell out of me . then"
susan and i decide to go to ralph ’s fishing station on the dock and have a beer . or <#>
"went to the movies with my daughter , lisa ."
"she ’s a huge fan of m. night <UNK> , so we’ve been looking forward to seeing the village ."
stopped at starbucks for coffee on this rare saturday with her at home .
"she ’s working toward her master ’s while working <#> full time jobs , so usually she has classes on the weekends ."
"she has a few weeks now between the end of summer session and the beginning of the fall , so we’ve been able to spend some time together ."
"hey , i 'm not proud of it -- everyone has their dark side ."
"i do n't eat red meat , so i order the crappy chicken sandwich ."
i ask for a tender crisp sandwich with no <UNK> and a diet coke .
the female voice behind the microphone gets this real strange tone as she tells me to drive around to window # <#> .
"i drive around the building toward my food , and i see the girl who took my order hanging out - all the way out - of the window ."
she 's outside from about mid - thigh up .
she 's waving her arms at me very <UNK> hurry up .
this particular burger king has <UNK> this window pretty high up .
she 's hanging out like the <UNK> at the gate to the <UNK> city .
"she waves me over and points at the car in front of me , driven by a blond kid about <#> ,"
"he just ordered the tender crisp sandwich with extra <UNK> , then you come along next and order the tender crisp sandwich with no <UNK> . """
this chick is <UNK> by this nearly <UNK> sequence of events .
it seems rude to not to acknowledge the high point of her day .
""" well , "" i say , "" that 's why we 're divorced now . """
where was this woman when i was thinking of doing stand - up ?
she 's laughing so hard that she feels compelled to go get everyone else on the shift and bring them in on the joke .
"within a minute , <#> or <#> indian women are <UNK> the drive - thru laughing about <UNK> and broken <UNK> ."
"and the poor guy , my ex , in the car ahead has to wait for his food while wondering why he 's being pointed at ."
"no <UNK> , no <UNK> , "" in chorus ."
never enjoyed <#> of those lousy sandwiches more in my life .
urllink link is it possible for a ' <#> <UNK> to <UNK> heal itself ?
"i 'm here to <UNK> , brothers and sisters , that mine has ."
"i 'll take the bus , but i wo n't do dishes ."
"so i used my big soup pot to fill the thing , soaking the floor in the process , kicked the <UNK> spot , and ta da !"
coming soon to a blog near you - adventures in dining out .
drove out to <UNK> ( <UNK> - since the check engine light is still flashing at me and the inspection is <#> months <UNK> .
i continue to live my life on the edge . ) and slept on the beach .
found this really cool little crab <UNK> and had some dinner with jazz in the background .
"then i 'm thinking bubble bath , red wine and john <UNK> ."
"ok , so i should stop playing with the html and actually post something , right ?"
"so much self - discipline required , i 'm not sure i 'm up to whole blog thing ."
a weekend stretches before me filled with fabulous possibilities .... must climb out of the work clothes and go find something fun to do .
scheduled all my days off for the rest of the year .
lots of long weekends and a week in december .
"urllink you are probably finding the baby day counter obnoxious , but eventually you may find it adorable . or <UNK> . or not ."
"i am planning a few long weekends myself , as difficult as it is for me to take off from work ."
you never know what might happen in my absence .
they may find that they can get along without me .
so i have <#> days still to take before the end of the year or i lose them .
have n't taken a day off yet this year .
"i am either the best employee ever , or out of my mind ."
"so i am forcing myself to schedule <#> days off during august , september , october , and then the week before christmas ."
i heard american <UNK> has $ <#> <UNK> between new york and la if booked this week .
", i 'm thinking a spa day is in order ."
i feel like the stress of the last <#> years is <UNK> into my neck .
"by the way , in case anyone is wondering , <UNK> is the best friend in the world ."
"oh , and i never did find anyone to go to the movies with sunday night , because ( rant ) everyone i know is lazy and boring ."
"perfectly acceptable sci - fi stuff , but i would have liked to have seen the robot 's character more fully developed ."
i seem to remember more depth in the novel .
"come with me next time , or miss once again my insightful and witty commentary ."
"this is me , , , cool huh ..."
there is a great <UNK> on the part of muslim <UNK> to build their <UNK> without <UNK> or involvement with the west and its <UNK> ways and influences .
my <UNK> is that we should let them have at it .
"and iran is what we need to watch and learn from , as the first few steps of <UNK> against the islamic <UNK> are <UNK> being made ."
the greatest foreign aid policy move we can make now is to let the markets determine the truth about these failed states and backwards <UNK> .
we need to turn the restrictions on oil exploration and development in the western <UNK> off .
"in the past , foreign aid has been given <#> <UNK> ."
this would be a great reason if the truth only bore itself out in the long term results .
"“ of the <#> countries with the most <UNK> <UNK> in the world , <#> have been receiving u.s ."
foreign aid for periods ranging from <#> years to <#> years .
"of these <#> countries , <#> are <UNK> today than they were in <#> and <#> others are just as poor as they were <#> decades ago ."
"if foreign assistance was an effective development tool , every <#> of the <#> countries should have shown some improvement ."
"this would seem to be a good idea , but that ’s not even a portion of what killed the <UNK> ."
it wasn’t until <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> started to fold that the soviet union was shown to be a pathetic giant .
” the heritage foundation ( the material quoted here is not “
– the article used as a background here was written <#> years ago )
let them rise or fail on their own <UNK> .
"after the mission is accomplished in iraq , this should be the next front we open ."
the father of the <UNK> american <UNK> worker has now gone on record as saying that his son died “ for the sins of george bush and donald rumsfeld .
berg didn’t die for the sins of george bush and donald rumsfeld like some modern christ <UNK> for a larger evil .
"it was just an act of <UNK> and <UNK> , pure and simple ."
with more and more of the story <UNK> we find still more evidence of the <UNK> and flawed logic that is in the minds of muslim <UNK> .
"berg , if anything , was a friend to muslims ."
he held them in no particular <UNK> and <UNK> no <UNK> against them .
"he seems to have been in iraq to work or find work , but in any case to help with the <UNK> of the country ."
so the <UNK> running the terror cells in iraq more than likely murdered someone more inclined to be an ally .
"in fact , a person would have to be some special kind of stupid not to realize this ) ."
if the victim ’s father is not just being led by grief – which we can allow for
"so berg died for the sins of his own father , who more obviously than the government , was a miserable failure where it counted most ."
urllink <UNK> ( day <#> ) urllink the <UNK> are huge ! !

urllink we are keeping a journal of the <UNK> as they grow .
the last couple of days have been hectic due to grandpa <UNK> 's heart surgery ( which he is recovering nicely from ) .
wednesday the 28th i flew out of the house at 7:30 to be at the hospital .
the boys spent the day with <UNK> ( my mother ) and <UNK> went to camp .
thursday morning we did the calendar and the <UNK> journal before heading into nyc for a hospital visit .
we read lots of books in the cafeteria ( the boys could not visit ) .
<UNK> practiced counting to <#> with a number <UNK> .
friday we all went to the city after calendar and journal .
the boys and i walked from port authority all the way <UNK> to <UNK> hospital ! ( about <#> <#> miles ) we discovered the glass garden at <UNK> .
"it was perfect , lots of plants , birds , <UNK> pond , <UNK> , play area outside with ride on vehicles ."
the kids loved it and then they had dinner with their uncle andrew in the hospital cafeteria .
"many late nights , lots of break in routine , wild tired children , looking to get back to normal ( whatever that is ! )"
that 's why marriage is until death do us part .
how many of us look at marriage in this way ?
"yet , in the catholic church marriage is a <UNK> ... here is what the <UNK> of the catholic church has to say about it ."
"how wonderful the bond between <#> believers , now <#> in hope , <#> in desire , <#> in discipline , <#> in the same service !"
"they are both children of <#> father and <UNK> of the same master , <UNK> in spirit and flesh , truly <#> in <#> flesh ."
"where the flesh is <#> , <#> also is the <UNK> ]"
""" so why do so many couples have so little <UNK> <#> or <#> years after their marriage commitment ?"
"that same spirit of <UNK> that i noted a few days ago , can also happen in marriages ."
we are all so shocked when he hear couple after couple getting divorced these days ...
actually the surprising thing is how many are still together ...
<UNK> all heard that a good marriage takes work and it absolutely does .
"there lies the key to maintaining an intimate marriage , today more then ever we need god in our lives ."

what i do want to know is just what is hillary clinton 's problem ?
"over the <#> days of convention coverage , she was shown on screen many times ."
"once , of course , was her speech , but the rest were just shots of her in her seat watching the <UNK> ."
the only time she did n't look bored out of her skull was when she was at the <UNK> .
"i could n't stand her before , and i really ca n't stand her now ."
"it will be very , very hard for me to vote for her if she ends up as the democratic presidential <UNK> in the future ."
"another interview opportunity has come up , and this may be a good <#> ."
it 's for a <UNK> company that is looking to replace someone who is <UNK> .
it 's a customer <UNK> rep position with a very large company .
the woman i spoke with is very nice and i have an interview next tuesday at 8:30 .
"i 'm still having <UNK> angst , but will save that <UNK> for another entry ."
"i imagine that they will all be a good bit of work , but the huge plus is that they are all subjects that i am very interested in ."
"i 'm going to dinner with <UNK> dearest and then on to the <UNK> theatre in <UNK> to see "" <UNK> rock ."
"oh , and they have a bar , too ."
"i 've never been there , and i 'm looking forward to seeing the theater as much as the movie ."
there are some great photos on their website ~ urllink <UNK> theater .
it 's also the home of the <UNK> ballet and the <UNK> symphony .
i just got a call from the perfume in a box people about my interview yesterday .
would n't you know ; they offered me the job .
"the pay is a bit lower than the last place , but not by much , and the <UNK> of the shorter commute will help even things out ."
the benefits plan will allow be to stay with the doctor
"it is a huge relief , though , to have accepted an offer ."
i got so tired of his whining about how hard it is to find work that this would be sweet .
"what he never seemed to get is that you have to be somewhat flexible and , here 's the real catch , you have to go look for it !"
"he had gotten fired from a job right before we met and a couple of weeks later , i left a job ."
"last i heard , there was no job fairy that is going to come in an leave an offer sheet under your pillow as you sleep ."
"like it or not , you 've got to pimp yourself to the people with the jobs to fill ."
i did not sleep well at all last night .
"maybe i should switch to <UNK> after <UNK> or so , eh ?"
"when it was time to get up and start getting ready for my interviews , i had to do some serious self - motivation to get moving ."
"so i get my act together , get out the door and am almost at the freeway on - <UNK> when i realize i 've forgotten my purse ."
i arrived at the first interview only to walk through the door into a cloud of horrific perfume <UNK> .
is there such a thing as perfume in a box ?
"being that perfume is <#> of my <UNK> <UNK> , there is no way i could work in that place ."
"i played nice and did the interview , trying to convince myself that it was n't as bad as it seemed ."
the woman i spoke with asked me <#> different times if i had any accounts <UNK> experience .
what really surprised me is the that this place looked pretty <UNK> for a $ <#> <#> dollar a year operation .
"it looked like the sort of place that would <UNK> of perfume in a box . to be even more blunt , so did the people working there ."
"so after the chat portion ended , she asked me to take on of those personality assessment tests ."
"my appointment was at 9:00 , and i did n't get out of there till <UNK> ."
i do n't even know why i bothered with treating the test as anything serious .
"a printing company where people were very casually dressed , but still maintained a very nice atmosphere ."
"i liked the person i spoke with , and we seemed to hit it off pretty well ."
"i think that the job sounds fine , and i like the location ."
the downside is that it does n't pay as well as i had hoped and benefits do n't kick in for <#> months .
they have more interviews scheduled and will be calling people back for 2nd interviews .
i took it as a good sign that she asked my <UNK> regarding a start date .
i had a couple more calls about my resume this afternoon .
"<#> from an agency who found my resume online , and <#> from a <UNK> who also found me online ."
"the conversation with the <UNK> sounded promising , so i may be getting a call from the company she was representing ."
convention watch : what i would n't give to be at the convention this time around .
"not only is it in my beloved boston , there have been some great speeches ."
what a way to announce your presence to the national political arena !
"and teresa heinz kerry - the more i see her , the more i like her ."
"when it 's time to change , it 's time to <UNK> "" hi , my name is mary and i 'm a reality tv addict ."
trading <UNK> : could <UNK> <UNK> be any more of a bitch ?
"i seriously can not stand this woman , and her tv life was only <#> hours long !"
"her "" $ <UNK> may not be much to you or me.. "" comment really took the cake ."
"i 'd be willing to bet that "" let them eat cake "" is <UNK> on this woman 's towels ."
last comic standing just has n't grabbed me the way it did last time around .
"i do like <UNK> enough to really hope that he wins , but the rest of them ?"
i 'd be hard pressed to tell you their names .
"i love this show , but turned as green as the title text when the <UNK> were sent to st <UNK> ."
what is wrong with all of those people crying and <UNK> over the <UNK> ?
i would have been mad that i had to wolf it down rather than enjoy it .
"so it was a huge amount to eat , and it probably was n't the best <UNK> in the country ,"
but it 's not like i 'm used to <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> on a regular basis .
"i do n't even eat the cheap stuff on a regular basis , but i do love it ."
then they had to either choose between <UNK> ( <UNK> ?
go on with your silly race and leave me to russia .
no comments on big brother <#> yet .
i had to tape it so i could watch last comic .
i do n't know how long i 'm going to stick with <UNK> .
this is the first time i 've watched this many episodes ( about half a dozen ) since <UNK> .
i found it was taking more energy to keep up with that it was worth .
"damn , my throat is sore and raw , and i 'm all <UNK> ."
may all of the perfume in a box wearing people be forced into <UNK> awareness of their own <UNK> for the rest of eternity .
"it 's been <#> days since my return <UNK> of e - mails to <UNK> , and no response ."
"he 's on aol , and i 've got a different <UNK> and read <UNK> are not an option ."
"there will be a <UNK> sent if he picks up the e - card , but nothing so far ."
"yes , i admit it , i want to know if i got the last word in ."
did i mention that i called his cell phone on the day of the e - mail war ?
"hey , if he 's going to read sarcasm into placed where it does n't exist , i might as well serve it up ."
it becomes very difficult to apologize for the <UNK> when the person who is <UNK> blows up rather than talking it out .
i do admit that i am nothing short of stunned at his drama queen reaction to the whole thing .
"an e - mail that was never replied to , by the way ."
"do other people see him as more <UNK> as he thinks he is , or do they see the negative side that i have been seeing ?"
"or , more <UNK> , someone to tell us that we both have had a hand in it ."
i 'm sure i would n't be so wound up about <UNK> if i was n't also dealing with the unemployment thing .
"i had some good stuff picked out : <UNK> in literature , film history , and cultural <UNK> ."
"on a more positive note , i 've got <#> interviews tomorrow ."
"both for customer service , but it 's still good to know that my resume is being noticed ."
"the e - mail was kind of obnoxious , though ."
""" we have this job and found your resume online ."
if they pay enough and the benefits are good i would take it if the hours would work with school .
"so how about that democratic national convention , huh ?"
"( yes , i know that the white text wo n't show up well at all , but i want red white an blue !"
"i do love jimmy carter , but as a speaker , he 's a great <UNK> . and then there 's bubba ."
"the smartest thing that the convention <UNK> did was have bill clinton speaking as far away , time - wise , from kerry as possible ."
"i 'd vote for bill clinton for just about anything , anytime , <UNK> ."
the second smartest thing they did was have that kid play amazing grace on the violin in tribute to those who died on september 11th .
"but still , to see bill clinton walking <UNK> as do n't stop thinking about tomorrow played ..."
it 's <UNK> and mr landlord 's <UNK> is ringing .
what pissed me off about it is that the damned cheesy music and moaning woke me up at 1:30 in the morning !
"these <#> incidents were a couple of years apart , so it 's not like i 'm feeling <UNK> or anything ."
this guy is generally pretty cool as <UNK> go .
i was a bit <UNK> to see that he has dyed his hair .
"it was salt and pepper , but now is the color of iced tea ."
"it 's not that it looks bad , but it was a rather <UNK> difference ."
"i 've got <#> interview at <UNK> , and another at <UNK> tomorrow and i think that getting a reasonable amount of sleep would be a good idea ."
what i 'm really hoping for is a call from a particular company about an interview .
"it sounds like a great fit , both the position and the company philosophy ~ keeping my fingers crossed !"
what i do not want is another customer service job .
what i will probably have to do is take another customer service job since my savings are ...
he was a high school drop - out and he did okay .
today had been planned as a sort of a break day ; spend the morning checking the employment websites and then read or watch a movie .
"no protest , no rant , no "" do n't let the"
"i m door hit you on the ass ... "" nothing ."
"but then ... me being me , i could n't leave well enough alone ."
i sent him a big ol ' box of stuff that i had been putting together for him .
"so he gets the stuff , waits a few days , and then sends a very sweet e - mail . and leaves a message in the same tone ."
then i was online <#> night and he <UNK> to thank me for the stuff .
<UNK> move to go back to <UNK> and phone calls .
yesterday he <UNK> and started to complain about his sister . again .
she showed up at his place a little over a year ago and never left .
"she 's been homeless ( living in another state ) for years , and he 's always sent money to her whenever she asked ."
she knows that he wo n't say no to her .
so she showed up on his <UNK> <#> months ago to visit their <UNK> father who was being cared for by ny guy .
"she 's still there , their father has dies , and she 's still there ."
"the landlord gave her <#> days to get out , and sis ignored it ."
she know that <UNK> will yell at her to leave but wo n't do a damned thing to back it up .
was complaining about her in conversation after conversation about about
how <UNK> he is that he is supporting her .
i told him if he stopped buying her cigarettes and food she would either leave or find a way to contribute .
"more fun to whine and be used , i guess ."
there are other things on his <UNK> list and they are all <UNK> frequently .
he <UNK> out of the i m in a <UNK> fit .
telling me just what an awful person i am .
"let 's see ; i 'm void of compassion , self absorbed , and <UNK> damaged ."
"there were more , but you get the <UNK> ."
"so , you are asking what i said in my e - mail ?"
"what i think really <UNK> him though is that i ended by asking if he ran away from our i m to another screen name , like maybe <UNK> ?"
"( yes , he has an annoying tendency to end his screen names with "" <#> "" ) ."
"<UNK> , he has declared the friendship dead since he can not be friends with someone who would send such a sarcastic e - mail ."
"the calls i made on my way to work did n't count for much either , i guess ."
"i gave and gave and gave , and am being punished for not having given enough ."
"he 's told me many times that he <UNK> stand on convention or ceremony , and to limit yourself to such things <UNK> <UNK> ."
"so he will find <#> , yes <#> , e - mails in his box ."
"he may delete them all , but at least it will give him <UNK> or something in the process ."
"he ended <#> of the e - mails by saying that i do n't realize what i "" could have had . """
okay . whatever . pretty safe to pull a statement like that out of your ass once you 've announced the end of a relationship .
"if he <UNK> me so much , why does this hurt so bad ?"
i 'm gonna go make me a whole lot of it .
it 's been tough for me to come to <UNK> with the who <UNK> thing .
"i spent a really great evening with my sister yesterday , and told her about what happened ."
"not only does she really listen , but she is honest and <UNK> , and it was a huge help to talk to her about all of this ."
"i have n't talked to anyone else about it , but it felt really good to finally be able to ."
i 'm extremely concerned with the possibility of <UNK> problems .
"i 've gone back on <UNK> and also the generic version of <UNK> , and am going to make the best of it ."
i also start classes at the community college tomorrow .
"nothing like a new job and going back to school all on the same day , huh ?"
"i 'm really looking forward to it , and am glad that i was able to find some classes that really interest me for my first semester back ."
the last <#> jobs i 've had all began with a call from <UNK> to wish me well and encourage me on my first day .
how come i miss him so much when things were so difficult for the last year ?
i did n't sleep well at all last night .
i do n't think i slept more than an hour at a time without waking up thanks to some random <UNK> discomfort .
"i 'm feeling better now , but i 've been <UNK> all day thanks to the lack of sleep ."
the guy from <UNK> ( unemployment ) did call me back yesterday .
i 'm not feeling too hopeful about getting payments .
my manager and i discussed that very thing at my review <#> days before she fired me !
"she thought that was an excellent suggestion , as there is nothing even remotely like written <UNK> for anything in customer service ."
<#> of the <UNK> of working there was that we could have framed items that were returned ~ free of charge .
and i 'm still annoyed that i left a framed print that i really loved behind when i left work on that last day .
"it was a <UNK> photograph titled "" <UNK> of manhattan , "" a night photograph of some buildings on the edge of central park ."
i loved that print and was too upset to think to take it off of my cube wall .
"might be easier if "" <UNK> of manhattan "" had n't been a $ <#> print that , with <UNK> on it would have cost $ <#> ."
"it 's warmer than necessary in here , and i 'm too <UNK> to type anymore ."
i did n't realize that so much time had passed since my last post .
i just returned from running errands and found a message from him asking me to return his call and now my stomach is in <UNK> .
"all i can do is be honest with him , as i was in my interview , and hope for the best ."
"the amount of the payment i would receive is not large , but it would be immensely helpful ."
"what has me really frightened is that my former employer is very <UNK> , and i have no idea what they may have told the employment development department people ."
blah i 've spent quite a bit of time <UNK> about the situation with the guy in new york .
i was fine with it a whole lot faster when i was the <#> who called it <UNK> .
then he came <UNK> around being a sweet and cute and stuff and
i guess what it comes down to is that he is so quick to throw everything out over his perception of the tone of an e - mail .
what my difficulty was with was his <UNK> complaining about the same situations over and over and over .
"to top it off , the main issue he was having is <#> that he could have taken control of had he chosen to do so ."
"everybody needs to vent sometimes , but to let it <UNK> every conversation ?"
"i 'm <UNK> that he read the rest of my responses , but i do n't have any way to know ."
it does make me feel better to know for sure that he at least read that <#> .
"i 've not gotten any sort of reaction from him , and that 's fine ."
"based on past experience with him i know that when he feels that he has been <UNK> , a <UNK> is to follow ."
of course he may not have answered because he really does n't want to have anything further to do with me .
at this point i think it may be what 's best .
"and that was even with general topics , not things specific to him ."
"i 'm human too , and like everyone else , i have limits as to what i am physically and emotionally able to do . once again , blah ."
i had a job interview on tuesday for a position that i think i might actually like .
i just hope that the <UNK> liked me enough to keep my resume at the top of the pile as they go through the interview process .
"i did consider it a positive thing that once the department manager completed her <UNK> , she had me speak with <#> other managers as well ."
"if she had thought i was not suited for the job , i doubt she would have had them take the time to talk to me ."
"they have offices all over the country , including <UNK> , nj , and boston - both places i would love to live ."
<UNK> fingers : : : it 's been an hour and <#> minutes since i left the message for the unemployment guy .
"i know that he was probably on lunch most of that time , but i 'm getting more and more nervous about the outcome as the minutes go by ."
"i spend a lot of time wondering why he loves me , how can he possibly want me and how long will he stay ? a little history"
: i was finally diagnosed after <#> years of <UNK> testing and <#> months after my divorce was final .
even before we got married he told me that if i got sick he would n't leave me .
he would n't take care of me but he would n't leave me .
"so as it became more and more clear , lo these many years later , that i was ill in some form ."
no way was i going to take of myself and him .
"and no it was n't that easy nor that <UNK> , and yes there were other , bigger reasons , but this was definitely in the mix ."
"now my ' new ' man and i have been together <#> years the end of august , and almost did n't make it this far ."
as a matter of fact we 've just <UNK> after a very nasty blow - up that drove us apart .
somehow we 've gotten past the anger and are working our way through the mess .
the fears i 've had from the day we met .
"in the time we 've known each other i 've had a number of <UNK> , some worse than others , and <#> <UNK> ."
he 's taken care of me as he cares about me .
somehow he 's able to keep them separate most of the time .
"and now , as <#> of my worst fears has come true , he stays and is helping me through this as well ."
"see , <#> of my ms losses is my ability to feel most things sexual ."
it has either been pain or no sensation at all .
"and so as we <UNK> and explore a better relationship , once again he 's encouraging me to find pleasures in the things that do work ."
"i cry when nothing works , i cry when i feel anything that does n't hurt , i cry when there 's any kind of ' progress ' ."
but today was a r ed l <UNK> d ay .
"with much patience and <UNK> , i had an orgasm ."
it 's been a very long time .
"it is n't the same as before , not as intense and just feels ' different ' ."
and it takes a lot of work but it happened .
i 've tried to find a way to describe what it 's like now . or what the differences are .
"then there 's the rest of it , the <UNK> and those things have no words ."
"but the best part is that this incredible man has the love , patience and lasting power to make sure that i have every chance ."
"we know that , but he 's still here ."
at least my ability to please him still works .
i so often think he could do much better .
"some of that is me , some of it is my ms ."
"he 's such an active man ; camping , <UNK> , travel ."
"i 've always seen a life with him , but i so very much never want him to <UNK> being with me ."
and then there 's the issue of when things happen to me and he 's not there .
"i feel bad calling him and <UNK> whatever he 's involved in ; work , school , or social ."
i do n't want him coming to see me as needy .
( i 'm not . ) and yet if i do n't call him at the time something happens he 's upset with me for not .
"and no matter how good things are or what <UNK> words he has , this is always in the back of my mind ."
"he knows about this , and does his best to calm my fears , and i do my best to put them aside ."
still it 's there ready to threaten my balance . knowing
it 's there helps me to <UNK> things before they get in the way .
"and for now : he loves me , i cherish every moment of it , love him beyond words , and look to a long full life with him ."
i know what i forgot to tell you yesterday .
the most <UNK> <UNK> of all – fatigue .
if you don’t suffer from it you don’t know what it is .
i tell people my fatigue is up and they tell me how tired they are too .
i can have a great night ’s sleep and wake up barely able to move because of fatigue .
"think of the day you were the most tired in your life , completely exhausted ."
"now multiple it by about <#> or so , now you’re coming closer ."
now apply that to other things like breathing and you’ll start to get the idea .
the drug i take for the <UNK> is up a substantial amount and its biggest side effect in me is fatigue .
by the time this gets out to you i’ve worked and <UNK> it and cleared my head ( mostly . )
so today was really going to be about my kids .
they’re <#> ( girl ) and <#> ( boy ) and we’ve been through a lot together .
"<UNK> teenager , <UNK> it by adding a divorce and then toss in ms ."
my daughter went through the usual mom hating <UNK> <UNK> by some insane factor and her denial for the first year or <#> of my ms .
i can’t say which kid it was harder on .
i’d been healthy and active and that changed very quickly .
"you’d be proud to know her , i know i am ."
"and <#> of the nice side effects ( yes , there are good ones , just usually not with medication )"
is that she ’s become active in my healthcare .
it ’s been hard for her at school and out of state .
"but when she ’s home , she goes to the doctor with me and my tests when she can ."
she wants to know all the details and to be a part of my support system .
"he was young and angry with his dad , so he became my <UNK> ."
i didn’t want him to not be a kid cuz he felt i needed help .
a <UNK> without any idea of what it really meant .
what that caring has done is to make him a strong and compassionate young man .
"he ’s <#> , what do you expect ? ! and getting him to help around the house is like pulling teeth ."
but he makes sure i know where he is ( usually ) and when i’m really bad he pops in every now and then to check on me .
be around more once school starts as his sister will be gone again .
they seemed to have worked it out between them .
"i try to be strong for them , but i’ve learned that it ’s ok to have a bad day , to cry , to be frustrated or scared ."
but sometimes i’ll walk in the door and just sit down and cry .
"<#> or the other or both will come and just sit with me , put their arms around me and be still ."
that 's not to say we don’t have our moments .
"but they’re normal ( is there any such thing ? ) teenage moments , not ' oh my god , my mom has ms ' moments ."
we constantly learn new ways to make things work .
"in truth , i think that having ms has helped to keep communication open through these years where so many families struggle ."
i thought i’d start here today giving you a little bit of information about ms .
it ’s an auto immune disease that attacks the <UNK> system .
"it is not <UNK> , it affects men and women and there is no cure ."
the <UNK> that are available are only band aids .
they help to boost the body ’s system but can’t stop a <UNK> from happening .
the best they can do is to help limit the length and maybe the damage .
there are some common factors but the results are completely individual .
at least that ’s the most obvious <UNK> to the world .
at it ’s worst i use a wheel chair and at my best you can’t tell there ’s anything wrong except that i have a very slight limp .
not everyone with ms gets <UNK> and not everyone that has <UNK> has ms .
it ’s a severely painful <UNK> that can be controlled by medication .
of course the side effects of the drugs cause their own problems and that ’s a story of its own .
"then there are the other things that i <UNK> as lesser , though they really aren’t , just not so apparent ."
"i can feel the pressure of a touch , but not always the <UNK> of it ; often in <UNK> degrees ."
"<#> years ago i had a single episode of double vision that only lasted a few hours , thank god ."
"vision is often affected for those with ms , i’ve been lucky ."
"i have <#> points on my body that suffer from pain , but we’re learning how to protect them ."
in <#> i had my first distinct ms attack .
it began as <UNK> on the right side of my face .
you know the feeling of <UNK> as it wears off ?
just like that . sometimes just a patch and other times affecting the whole side of my head .
high blood pressure runs in my family as does stroke .
"we went to the er , afraid this was a <UNK> to stroke ."
"though still married at the time , we were dirt poor and my <#> kids weren’t in school yet ."
so i forgot about it and went on with my life .
"i stumbled and fell every few months , but i never linked it to anything . and then <#> years later new and steady symptoms started ."
"i was tested for everything : hiv , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , the list was incredibly long ."
in the meantime i was doing my own research and figured out it was probably ms .
he washed his hands of me after only a couple visits cuz i wanted answers and i wasn’t a clear cut case .
the next <#> ran tests from checking my <UNK> to a <UNK> tap .
"everything , and i do mean everything , came back <UNK> . still no <UNK> ."
"finally i had an attack that took me off my feet , literally ."
"the common response to a <UNK> is <UNK> : <UNK> iv , a daily dose ( <#> - <#> days ) of a <UNK> by iv ."
the purpose of this pounding of <UNK> is to shut down the immune system .
it was decided that if i responded to the iv then it was ms and if i didn’t then we still didn’t know .
"by the time you get on the treatment , the attack has done it ’s damage ."
the drugs are just to shut it down sooner .
after the iv part is done you get switched to <UNK> .
until this <UNK> the course of <UNK> was always <#> weeks .
( my kids have learned to stay out of trouble and away from me . )
this time i had a <#> day course of the iv treatment and my current <UNK> gave me a <#> day pack and i was done .
there was so much relief around here i can’t even tell you .
<UNK> are <UNK> for their negative affects on your mood .
so in the last <#> years the kids and i have learned our way through .
"we deal with <UNK> results , some hard decisions and after much trial and error , we’re now a team ."
"they are amazing , but more on them another time ."
my name is sue and despite what i 'm told about my looks i really do have teenagers .
"that 's multiple <UNK> , for those of you that do n't know ."
it 's a chronic and <UNK> disease that spends most of it 's time frustrating the hell out of me .
it 's july <#> and i 've just had my first <UNK> in <#> years .
"i 'm nothing special , no different from anyone else . but"
unlike many others i want people around me to know i 'm disabled and why .
"the better educated people are , the more normal they 'll treat me and the better they may know what to do if something happens to me ."
"my response , and it 's most often the truth , is that my current pace is running - for me ."
"it is n't a sadness really , just a memory that i used to be normal ."
my ms did n't hit until <#> and then was n't recognized .
i was finally diagnosed in <#> and then only by accident .
with ms you 're never in <UNK> and you 'll never be <UNK> .
"ca n't blame the <UNK> really , but if they 'd made some decisions sooner , treatment could have started sooner ."
"ok , i could <UNK> on here for quite some time , but i 'll leave you with this for now ."
"i 'll be back , hope you will <UNK> >"
"so what , you might say - i would ."
but i have a stomach ache every time i eat these days .
i 'm hoping it 's just the way my nerves and the the <UNK> knife are <UNK> themselves .
that and the fact that my son is coming home sunday .
i 've missed him and ca n't wait to hear about his adventures .
"still , there 's some anxiety about telling him that i 've brought the dreaded boyfriend back into my life ."
i have a feeling it 's gonna be a rough week .
"but my daughter surprised me , maybe the boy will too ."
i did n't give her enough credit so maybe i 'm <UNK> him as well .
"i want him to understand that the circumstances are different , better and that i 'm happy ."
i just want him to respect mine too .
i 'm sure it wo n't be nearly as bad as i fear .
"still , i 'm afraid it might just be ."
i think i 'm more worried about that than i am about the <UNK> knife itself .
i had a spike of pain a couple weeks ago .
"i can see , but for close work like reading i really have to focus ."
the fatigue is affecting my eyes and the muscles need some encouragement to focus on the close stuff .
"it 's not a problem per se , just really annoying ."
"i know we expect good things from this surgery , but i 'm anxious ."
the last time i had results within a couple weeks .
i 'm working at setting my mind for the <#> month mark this time .
"that 's a little <UNK> , but it 's the reality ."
i am so looking forward to getting out of the wheelchair .
there are no words to explain what that means to me .
"last year , during the short window of ' normal ' i had we put this off ."
we 'd been invited to a wedding and were planning to make that our time .
"then he got sick , i mean really sick , hospital sick ."
"i was disappointed , sure , but really just concerned and worried about him ."
"he was just mad , no i think furious or <UNK> is more like it ."
"he 's fine now , but it was n't too long after that the <UNK> came back , the drugs started and i could n't walk again ."
to plan and look forward to all the things i 'll be able to do again .
"i just want to move across the floor in his arms , cheek to cheek , music , <UNK> ."
"sure , there are other things to look forward to , like grocery shopping , travel , <UNK> the lawn ."
"good , old fashioned , in his arms dancing ."
i 've talked to both the kids and they 're totally on board .
i told him and it was the right thing to do .
my daughter is just glad it should be done before she 's off to school .
so i have a small window of time to get this done .
after he 's home ( in another week ) and before she leaves for school . and
i have a doctor that understands the importance of this to me .
he and his staff are doing everything they can to make this happen .
i did n't realize how anxious i was about today 's trip to the doctor .
there is n't anything else i can take that is n't going to have some side effect that 's as bad or worse than what i 've got now .
<#> of them are <UNK> and <#> of those is brain surgery !
and then there 's a repeat of the <UNK> knife .
"it is n't done a lot for <UNK> , at least not by this md , but he is fairly <UNK> about who he 'll do a repeat on ."
i 'm <UNK> set for <#> weeks from today .
the nice thing about this procedure is that recovery is only a couple of days .
it 's an overnight hospital stay and then another day and you 're set .
you just have to be conscious about the <#> holes in your head from the halo they use to lock you in to the <UNK> knife machine .
though in truth it was n't the <UNK> it was the shots of <UNK> that were the killer .
"ca n't say it hurt more than the <UNK> , cuz i could n't feel them , so i guess it did its job ."
this time i 'll have a touch of <UNK> .
i 'm ok after it 's done and set .
think i 'll treat myself to a new cd just for this .
you can bring your own music to listen to .
you 're locked into the machine so your head does n't move .
"the rest of you can move a bit , which is good , but your head has to be locked in ."
you do n't want the <UNK> hitting the wrong spot .
"for me and this procedure , it 's <#> back to back sessions <#> minutes each ."
"it can get pretty boring , but good music helps ."
plus it 's a measure of how much longer you have to go .
the biggest issue i really face right now is <UNK> .
"it is n't like i do n't want to make everyone happy , but sometimes i just ca n't do it ."
so here 's hoping that <#> is a go .
"okay , so you have some general background on my life , ms and some of the <UNK> . now on to the daily things of life ."
i finally lost the round with the chicago weather .
i collapsed last night from the heat and my own stupidity .
i have n't been drinking enough water and was most likely too <UNK> .
"i 'm some better today , but still feeling the effects ."
or maybe i 'm just feeling stressed about tomorrow .
"last year , in february , i had a <UNK> procedure called <UNK> knife ."
"for those of you that know meds , i was on a daily <UNK> of <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> ."
i needed <#> hour care cuz i was n't clear headed enough to take care of myself or let alone remember when to take each of these wonderful drugs .
"i was pain free and , after a few months of being <UNK> off the drugs , drug free ."
it was the first time in <#> years that i was drug free .
and then <#> days before thanksgiving it came back and with a <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> pain that affects the face .
"and when it hits it <UNK> me to the floor , even if i 'm sitting ."
they put me back on the <#> drug i should n't take .
it controls the pain but it <UNK> me of my <UNK> .
almost immediately i was back to using my walker .
after not being able to get my ' then ' <UNK> to switch me off <UNK> i switched doctors .
the new <#> switched me right away to <UNK> .
this is a drug we know i can tolerate .
"it has it 's own side effects and they are less then <UNK> ( thanks , dear - his word ) ."
"so i 'm able to function , but still not terribly mobile ."
so now it 's back to the <UNK> to see if i 'm a candidate for a second go round .
i 'm <UNK> cuz i do n't know what to expect .
if i 'm a candidate are the risks too great for me to consider it ?
and if i 'm not a candidate then what next ?
"see , i 'm will to accept that this may be as good as it gets , but not yet ."
i 'm making my list of questions for tomorrow and trying to be prepared .
"ok , so i 'm <#> of the lucky ones ."
"the people i work with range from ok to really good , with the rare pill drifting through ."
"i 've had to remind people about the ada and <UNK> with a baseball bat : and amazingly enough , i work for a healthcare organization ."
when i was first diagnosed i worked with <UNK> people so there was a lot of understanding that i couldn’t walk but my brain still worked .
then i transferred to an <UNK> department and faced a rude <UNK> .
healthcare didn’t mean that everyone who works here has a clue .
i was going to be a <#> woman education division .
my immediate manager was the most difficult person i’ve still come across .
"the bottom line was he didn’t want to know anything , and he didn’t want to make any exceptions for me ."
i really think he would have fired me if he could .
he even worked with hr to make sure that both the department and i were treated fairly .
"anyway , boss <#> was transferred and boss <#> was great ."
"people who don’t know , may or may not ask , i’m never offended and always glad to explain ."
"as for the people i work with on a daily <UNK> now , i’m treated like anyone else ."
i travel out of town for topic specific training .
people smile and wave or call out as we move down the <UNK> .
my position is challenging and my surroundings are supportive .

i ca n't find anything in me that has any recognition response to this .
"in the middle ages , you know , you got no points for <UNK> ."
"you always built from the past , and you <UNK> that into your own unique version ."
"when you 're young , i suppose there 's a great ego necessity to say , "" hey , it 's all original , i did it all myself !"
"even then , i knew that where the material comes from is almost irrelevant ."
does it matter that it 's [ from ] a newspaper article ?
"q : there 's a kind of <UNK> that comes with <UNK> and <UNK> , which you do n't get from your own original work ."
"there 's a hollywood version of <UNK> , which can also be positive ."
"[ ... ] but you run up against other things anyway , which is why i do n't think it 's that different from an original script ."

it all seems like intake ; it 's narrative and <UNK> intake
""" i 'm the only guy who wrote this , i made it up"
", i did n't get it anywhere else . """
but what i 'm doing now might be more pure and honest and <UNK> than what i did then .
posted by bruce <UNK> <#> of my favorite things to do is to put things together in ways that others may not have thought to connect them .
it 's in that spirit that i want to first take on a <UNK> of a term and then link it to our general topic .
""" <UNK> "" can refer with good reason to a bunch of different things ."
"<UNK> in literature is n't precisely the same thing as <UNK> in architecture , for instance ."
it 's also used as an umbrella term with <UNK> degrees of justification .
and very often good will is lacking when <UNK> get going about various <UNK> sins .
"this is not going to be a detailed <UNK> , however ."
at the core of <UNK> is an outlook about the pool of ideas from which <UNK> work .
"every creative field goes through <#> distinct stages - not once , but again and again ."
"first , there 's the general <UNK> of new ideas , new tools for working them over , and the whole deal ."
"very often , new tools open up the field , as <UNK> equipment has done several times ."
"in other cases , it 's just plain someone having fresh insights ."
"second , there 's the stage of <UNK> <UNK> approaches ."
"new ideas keep coming , but more and more of the cutting edge is concerned with the increasing <UNK> of things ."
this is where the most <UNK> <UNK> work appears :
"now , a whole lot of really good work comes out of this ."
but there comes a point where you 've taken something as far as it 'll go .
"third , there 's the stage of <UNK> <UNK> approaches ."
"the <UNK> creator turns away from <UNK> in favor of <UNK> , looking back at the pool of possibilities and seeing how they can fit together now ."
"there 's a renewed interest in popular as well as <UNK> versions of the field , and in its interaction with others ."
"there 's also a commonly applied term which i think creates some confusion , and i 'm going to suggest an alternative ."
i think it 's more useful to describe it as aware .
"the first time around , you do things and they work or they do n't , but you 're out there <UNK> and reflecting and pressing on ."
"when you return to those things later , you have a perspective shaped by what 's come in between ."
"you know , this time around , that if you push those ideas too far , they will all hit a wall ."
"you 've seen what comes of the apparently great ideas with <UNK> consequences , and of the apparently worthless ideas that someone else did wonderful things with ."
"you can come at it with the best of will , but not with ignorance or innocent ."
"you will remember as well as <UNK> , and there will always be a part of you separate from the old material because of experience ."
"in time , of course , the pool of ideas is worked over again , and something fresh comes in to shake things up and start the cycle again ."
"there are a bunch of ways to think about gaming , but <#> of them is this : it 's a <UNK> engagement with its source material ."
"gaming is , i think , an <UNK> <UNK> activity , <UNK> narrative and strategy and <UNK> and a mess of things all in a big bowl ."
<UNK> requires keeping it all up in the air somewhere .
analysis on multiple levels of engagement follows naturally from the very fact of being a <UNK> and having a character .
"you 're operating in a critic - like way all the time , whether it 's what you <UNK> at the moment or not ."
what 's interesting to me about this is that common <UNK> <UNK> match up well with <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> in other fields .
check out any issue of <UNK> 's for a lot of that .
<UNK> in the definition of a setting and in the approach of players to its <UNK> ?
"compare <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> of <UNK> , or any of a great many contemporary - swinging - <UNK> - types loose in semi - historical fiction ."
and so on through the <UNK> of common gaming <UNK> .
"much of this holds even when , sometimes especially when , the <UNK> in question are also given to <UNK> the sins of <UNK> ."
"folks who 'd like to read up on <UNK> should probably check out <UNK> <UNK> , because he thinks clearly and writes with <UNK> beauty ."
"now , the accepted wisdom in the game <UNK> these days that the best way to do this is to go the <UNK> route ."
i ca n't argue with that in most respects .
"however , unless you 're <UNK> cook , how much better do <UNK> <UNK> products sell than non - <UNK> <UNK> products ?"
"admittedly , that 's good advice under any circumstances , but bear in mind that i 'd actually like to make some money through self - publishing ."
"if it could be shown that a particular approach would increase my sales by a significant factor , i would certainly do it ."
it 's very hard for anyone to plan an effective business strategy when there 's so little information to go on .
"at least , that 's how it seems at my <UNK> end of the spectrum ."
"urllink how many times have we heard it said , "" oh , lord , give me a sign ! """
we all want to know if god exists ; maybe he just needs a reliable method to let us know he 's here .
"the <UNK> blogspot will also include updates that are more recent , along with the history in pictures that has already started ."
"although the majority of winter has passed us by , we are still experiencing quite a chill - in - the - air as we head into august ."
"the weekend passed with little happening out , as the temperature dropped and <UNK> showers left everyone either <UNK> or out and about elsewhere ."
the usual noise of the street 's kids riding bikes or kicking a ball was <UNK> .
"it was good to see paul and sandra back on australian soil following their <UNK> home to england , scotland and ireland ."
"and yet this end of the street does look nice and green , the <UNK> of pre - spring growth is certainly making a difference ."
it is only a pity that the <UNK> could n't get the <UNK> on the side wall of <#> .
"not that we are in any kind of hurry , knowing that the paint alone is going to burn a small hole in the pocket ."
but <UNK> for the <UNK> dinner party are enough of a distraction to make it through the <UNK> of the damp weekends .
it will certainly be an evening to remember ... until next time ...
although we had looked far and away ( including some <UNK> possibilities )
it was n't until <#> weekend we stumbled across a land - sale sign posted on the side of stock road .
"curious , as i was , and since neither of us knew of this land - sale , we <UNK> our trip to take a look ."
"to our surprise , we found a pocket of newly released blocks of land ."
"not - to - large , not - to - small ."
we drove about the small estate looking at the various <UNK> and found something we could actually picture as being ours .
"we left the new estate and spent some time thinking , and researching the idea of <UNK> our claim , on what was to become <UNK> avenue ."
"welcome to <UNK> avenue this blog is all about the various happenings , people , events that surround my local <UNK> ."
"it is important that you remember the information i intend to publish is my own , my own thoughts , feelings , and views ."
urllink the crew enjoying themselves after the main course .
the system fought and still does to not allow dna . tests . yet .
that is where many lose out . unless a person can hire or can some way find pro <UNK> representation .
a true investigation and research may never happen . because although the state <UNK> an <UNK> for each on death row - they are restricted .
and usually - the <UNK> have several cases at once .
"so , much that should be done is not ."
"now , caught up in such an <UNK> system you have the <UNK> ."
<UNK> - some with mental problems ignorant of the laws !
"most can not even understand <#> % of the legal system , they are caught up in ."
there for are not truly able to help much in their own defense .
nor understand or keep track of what their own <UNK> are doing . or not doing . unless these individuals are very lucky and someone comes in to help .
they are just run through the system - <UNK> for errors .
many who came ignorant - find ways to rise above the situation .
"but , a strong will and determination can not be <UNK> ."
what i try to give you - is an over all view of things people do n't usually hear - nor know .
without - being a long drawn out story .
talking about people who support us in the next letter
people would like to believe these are the good guys !
and i am not going to say all are bad . like in any group of people in society - you have good people and bad .
but the way innocent people end up on death row are due to the bad <#> .
you see police - <UNK> are just people . and
prone to the same human failing as all are .
how does a <UNK> climb the ladder of success . by solving crimes . and
to solve crimes you have those who will toss the rules aside .
<UNK> witnesses and have what is called jail house <UNK> come in and say - while in jail - this <UNK> told me how he did the crime .
a lesser sentence for the crime he was in jail for .
even when you prove this has occurred - the <UNK> can not be charged for this crime .
"which covers not only the <UNK> - but , the witnesses they use also ."
they are many who work hard and do what is right .
"unfortunately they , the honest ones , are caught in a bad situation that exists in that type of work ."
if they do - they are <UNK> by all others in uniform . and
so <UNK> difficult to prove ones innocence or that false evidence was used .
you see once on death row - <UNK> hard to get off .
the only difference is these cells - <UNK> - are made of concrete and steel bars - human <UNK> .
here we are <UNK> for years and years <UNK> appeals are played out .
myself - i have been in <#> of the cells for over <#> years .
"if all goes wrong , in appeals i could actually end up doing <#> years and then be <UNK> ."
yet they will say <UNK> <UNK> and justice has been done .
"but , what i try to let you see is an over all picture from the inside ."
<UNK> not really about me - but rather the system .
i am just <#> of the many . and there are innocent people on death rows .
<#> have been found in florida to date or last i heard .
<#> who did years in <#> of these cells - some for as many as <#> - <#> <#> - <#> years .
coming here at ages <#> - <#> - <#> .
they had stolen from them what i call the best years of their lives .
and when set free - they do not even receive an apology - <#> times out of <#> .
nothing can restore that which was <UNK> stolen away .
the bad memories and scars can not be taken away - nor healed .
"why , because the death penalty has become and perhaps always was political ."
<UNK> me and i will make things safer for society .
i will speed up appeals and end <UNK> - so <UNK> can be carried out faster .
he gives society false hope - to <UNK> a small percentage of people will make society safer and solve problems of crime .
rather using the death penalty as a <UNK> - he wins the vote to office .
politicians as we all know will say and do anything to win the election .
"i come back and then we should talk about the police , <UNK> and judges !"
perhaps its because the technology has out grown the human ability to grow both mentally - and <UNK> to match the 21st century .
it would be nice to believe that the death penalty was that simple of a mistake .
tat it was something flawed is in the intellect and could easily be <UNK> - by pointing out <UNK> the flaws !
but the truth is that death rows - the death penalty is the united states <UNK> in the closet .
"but , they no longer even try to hide it ."
"with the same arrogance , as much else they do - in dealing with the rest of the world ."
a case of do as we say not as we do .
but slowly - surely opposition has <UNK> - and the rest of the world has became aware of the death penalty .
groups have formed - people from all walks of life .
<UNK> their voices in protest against a system which is not <UNK> . and
"oh , the us still holds tight to their ways ."
"but , the voices of groups and individuals in opposition are causing concern ."
and the more voices that join in - the greater that concern will be .
for the men and women who <UNK> the many death rows across the usa .
you have shown us there are people who care ! which gives us hope and strength to flight <UNK> !
to survive years of <UNK> - <UNK> - existence .
so read the next part please ... and feel free to ask what you need to know ....

"he was in the navy , graduated from the <UNK> academy november 20th <#> ."
i mention the date because he died on november 20th <#> .
"i believe he was probably government <UNK> , though it is possible to be both an alien <UNK> and a government <UNK> ."
"there were , and are , a lot of <UNK> programs going on at the time ."
<UNK> <UNK> were also on the rise during this time frame according to part <#> the <UNK> .
i 'm sure i 've got an extra $ <#> laying around somewhere ...
i went to the <UNK> store and talked to the same person that waited on me the last time it happened .
i asked her what the deal was with these phones .
"at first she tried to be <UNK> , but after i <UNK> her a bit , she admitted they have a fairly high failure rate ."
i really like it and it 's great when it works .
"the combination of a wireless phone , internet access , email and the variety of palm <UNK> add up to make it a very cool device ."
"i guess as long as they 're willing to <UNK> replace it when it dies , i 'll stick with it ."
lisa and i went to see urllink the bourne <UNK> on friday .
it felt like being on a <#> - hour roller coaster ride .
the pace reminded me of the second indiana jones movie ( temple of doom ) .
matt <UNK> is pretty <UNK> as an <UNK> with a conscience .
why does urllink brian <UNK> always play bad guys ?
the rain made it tough to get up and moving this morning .
listened to a urllink story on npr about <UNK> that made me think of my urllink mother .
"although the woman featured in the story was older , they were alike in some ways ."
the part where she talked about how hard it was to let others in the family handle preparation of thanksgiving dinner really hit home .
it 's interesting how we are all caught up in our own lives but wind up having similar experiences without even knowing it .
there was a rally this morning to celebrate the company 's urllink strong second quarter results .
"i did n't attend , but urllink just about everyone else did ."
"most complained of not being able to see , but the <UNK> provided an excellent view of the <UNK> ."
i just hope i was n't <UNK> in my absence .
killing time on the plaza before dinner at urllink <UNK> .
"although some say that their music is not very hot , with lyrics like these from kissing the <UNK> , what 's there not to like ?"
but you 've got too much to wear on your sleeves it has too much to do with me and secretly i want to bury in the yard
the grey remains of a friendship <UNK> urllink download it here
"<UNK> came out with their first album "" no name face "" a few years ago ."
"there were quite a number of tracks which are quite good , with "" hanging by a moment "" receiving quite a lot of air time then ."
"however , there are some other <UNK> in the album like "" breathing "" , "" only <#> "" , "" somewhere in between "" , "" everything "" ."
"have you ever woke up early before your love <#> and just lie there and watch the person sleep , breathing gently ?"
interesting thing about this song is that its also about <UNK> love .
<UNK> lyrics and nice <UNK> pretty much describes the music of the beautiful south .
urllink <UNK> <UNK> has the kind of vocals you wished your local jazz lounge singer had .
"no , i have no idea how to pronounce her name either ."
be still my heart was the biggest hit from her album at first light .
her voice is <UNK> with <UNK> qualities but somehow sounds child - like at the same time .
"this is the kind of song you want to listen to after a major falling - out with your lover - full of longing , regret and <UNK> ."
<#> 's mistakes and regrets is a perfect example of <UNK> 's style .
"you start of slow and it builds into a screaming , rushing <UNK> of pounding emotions ."
"urllink even republicans don’t trust these things , despite republican governor bush ’s <UNK> that the machines are <UNK> <UNK> ."
"so , again i ask : what possible good can it serve to <UNK> these <UNK> having a paper <UNK> trail ?"
your <UNK> died to give you the right to vote .
follow the florida gop ’s <UNK> advice and urllink get an <UNK> ballot – lest <UNK> county become the next <UNK> county .
"here in lovely <UNK> county , we use <UNK> electronic voting machines ."
urllink cnn reports that a “ computer crash ” <UNK> votes recorded using these <UNK> machines in florida ( where else ) .
"more interestingly , officials had not backed up this data ."
urllink who on earth is running the show in florida ?
why would they not have plans in place to have this data backed up ?
"more interestingly yet , they have a rule in place in florida which <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> manual <UNK> of <UNK> gathered votes ."
"what , pray tell , is up with that ?"
"<UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> , a lawyer for the <UNK> coalition that <UNK> this <UNK> , sums it up best in the urllink ny times : “"
"” unless <UNK> county turns out to be the next florida , that is ."
"this is the only way you have , as a resident of <UNK> county , to ensure that a physical record exists of your vote ."
"get it in the mail , fill it out at home , and drop it off personally at your local <UNK> station the day of the election ."
for a sleepy little <UNK> it 's sure got some high <UNK> going on .
they promptly ran off into the woods and have yet to be located .
"meanwhile , the local newspaper 's headline , even all these many hours later ? """
make sure to check out the urllink kerry - edwards party <UNK> to <UNK> an acceptance speech party near you !
these will take place the day after tomorrow .
i just typed in my own area code and could n't believe how many events there will be to celebrate john kerry 's acceptance as democratic <UNK> for <UNK> .
"click the link , sign up , and consider it your first step to <UNK> sanity to this country be <UNK> a sane man to the <UNK> office ."
"well despite the mess i was in last nite , i actually had the best nite 's sleep that i 've had in weeks ."
i was so refreshed today and just <UNK> through all my work at the office .
i thought i 'd be a <UNK> mess but i feel great !
i just got home from happy hour to say goodbye to my coworker that is leaving this friday .
damn i think i had like <#> rum and <UNK> and <#> shots of <UNK> i ca n't remember .
all i know is the room is spinning round round like a record baby round round round round .
urllink urllink more than <#> people lined up for half a mile to pick up their new ipod <UNK> at the tokyo store .
"<UNK> , drug - <UNK> models were also on hand to push the new <UNK> ."
urllink if some of you have gone to my friend david 's urllink
""" we make rice - a - <UNK> from tourists "" blog then you 'll know he 's referring to a near accident on my recent trip to sf ."
i was <#> of the tourists almost made into a san francisco treat .
"there was much screaming , not from me i swear , but from some middle - aged couples also on the ride ."
no picture of that event but here 's a pic of us <UNK> down the hill before it happened .
i was holding onto the pole and hanging outside the cable car for this shot .
so i can have a few free hours to blog around .
it turns out ian 's little wound was not a bite .
so we took the <UNK> to <UNK> center for their birthday outing .
they each got a turn to run around the mall as we only brought <#> <UNK> .
"and we had dinner at billy <UNK> , a johnny rocket type <#> 's diner ."
mary and noah were dancing in their seats .
i even found the speak and sing jeff <UNK> doll .
i truly believe this was the last jeff in the western <UNK> .
he was tucked way back behind all the other dolls and probably no <#> bothered to do a complete search .
we searched k - <UNK> and <UNK> and toys - r - us in or and ca with no luck .
"it was like trying to buy <UNK> me <UNK> on christmas eve a few years ago , non - <UNK> ."
and he is n't even the most attractive <UNK> .
"murray , again , is not <#> of the better looking <UNK> ."
the doll is kind of freaky looking which might explain so many still on the shelf .
the set is complete and will be <UNK> tomorrow along with <UNK> the <UNK> .
"she sounds like she needs new batteries , kind of dragging ."
i sometimes feel like my batteries are running low .
"like now , i 'm starting to drag but sweetie still feels the need to shower before bed ."
i 'll be out before he <UNK> off but that shower is so important .
i wo n't be awake to enjoy the benefits of a clean sweetie .
"what is more important , sex once every <#> weeks or those twice daily showers ?"
priorities do n't seem to match like they used to !
! and ian has a bite mark on his shoulder .
freaky ! going to the <UNK> to see if they can <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> this mark .

"holds his feelings inside , just like me too ."
"i 've created a monster , i think !"
matt will be here to talk to <UNK> tonight ... not looking forward to seeing him .
i know i will want him to hold me ...
"i know i will end up hurting more , just seeing him ."
"god why am i so weak when it comes to him ? tomorrow at 2:00 , i have to go see that house again ."
"try to float the check , i guess ... hope it does n't go badly ..."
how do i do that without matt 's help ?
"she wants a deposit , and i do n't even have that ..."
i ca n't swallow my pride and ask him again ... ca n't do it .
"i have to act like i do n't need him , even though god knows i do ..."
at least i know i want him ... do n't know if i need him ...
i 'm off to pick up some clothes .
that 's the <#> good thing about being empty inside with stress eating away at you ...
you lose your appetite and finally lose some weight !
"well ... i always thought i 'd rather be fat and happy , but who was i kidding ..."
i 'd rather look good and fake the rest ...
"i woke up at 5:00 am , done sleeping for the night ."
now i 'm wishing that i did n't give dad all my <UNK> pm .
had the bright idea to take a ride to see where matt spent the night . turning into a stalker
he must have another slut on the line .
"he does n't waste any time , big surprise ."
"thanks for the help , matt ... so he leaves with an <UNK> kiss and hug for <UNK> , and with a "" see ya "" for alex ."
"so i call him and tell him how fucked up that was , then he goes and makes it better ."
"he does n't see the problem is that i have to tell him that he 's fucked up , before he realizes it and makes it better ."
he does n't see that i should n't have to tell him to be decent ... fuck !
"and of course alex did n't say much , just looked like he had been slapped ."
"he just held it inside , like i always do ..."
i hate matt for putting us through this .
"i know i did a lot of shit to contribute to our problems , but i was working on them , and really making progress ."
"i tried to hold in my feelings about him fucking the whore , right under my nose ..."
i tried to suck it up and show him that i was the better choice ...
he had the nerve to make a common about a <#> month separation not being enough ... like he had any intention of coming back .
what 's <#> more slap in the face ?
"i hope he realizes , a few months down the road , just what he did . what he lost"
as you can imagine i was in a panic to be sure that it did not go down the drain !
of course i am using the word tooth loosely since it is actually a piece of metal .
"this crown has been my tooth for about <#> years , and i can hardly believe it ."
way longer than the adult tooth that i lost in grade <#> !
so now i am left to try and figure out the best way to solve the problem .
"depending on how much <UNK> i am willing to sacrifice , it will cost between $ <#> and $ <#> to be able to continue smiling ."
"in the meantime , i have a long week end to hide from all my "" funny "" friends ( i 'm expecting <UNK> tomorrow ."
this will be <#> out of <#> long weekends this summer that rain has been called .
hopefully there will be some grace this weekend .
the boys did well in their swimming lessons : they both graduated into the next level .
<UNK> has passed into level <#> and <UNK> ( as he has decided to call himself from now on ) into level <#> .
he is out of <UNK> and has had no mistake since he learned <#> days ago .
i am so impressed by how willing he has been to learn and to try .
we woke up in room that looked like a hotel room .
neither dave nor myself had any <UNK> of how we had got here .
""" it must have been that couple last night ."
we looked around the room and drew the curtains open .
"the sun was shining , it was hot as always since we had come to mexico <#> weeks ago ."
"we were in a tall building , maybe on the 10th floor or so ."
""" this is n't exactly the place where i would 've expected to be held by <UNK>"
""" i said to dave while i rubbed my shoulder ."
""" i mean , there are people entering and leaving the building , i can hear noises , this is not a dark <UNK> somewhere in the woods "" ."
""" there are no woods on these <UNK> "" dave replied <UNK> ."
"i once again <UNK> that he was my sister 's boyfriend , not mine ."
he was so handsome and charming and according to what my sister says <UNK> well built where it matters .
after a few hours there was still nobody who would tell us anything .
"we were certainly worried but on the other hand everything seemed so peaceful , calm and sunny ."
i was delighted to find that this hotel room even had an on suite bathroom .
""" do you mind if i use the shower for a moment ? """
"of course not , but hurry in case somebody turns up "" ."
he basically stared at me and did n't seem to know where to look .
it took me a few seconds to realise that my silk <UNK> was sticking tightly to my breasts because i had forgotten to put my bra back on .
i hate <UNK> especially when it 's so hot but my size does n't allow me to go without very often .
""" <UNK> i did n't meant to ... "" i <UNK> and tried to <UNK> the fabric from my body but to not much avail ."
""" do n't worry i do n't mind at all "" dave said and smiled ."
""" yeah , i believe that "" i laughed "" but you know , you 're my sister 's ... "" ."
""" sure , sure "" he replied "" but that does n't mean i do n't appreciate a pretty sight ."
"i did n't realise before that you were that huge "" ."
""" i 'm doing my best to hide it you know ."
"particularly when my sister is at all part of the game , she 's so <UNK> "" ."
"dave laughed "" yeah you 're right , let 's just leave it there "" ."
we both realised that we had been stripped of all <UNK> .
""" do you have any idea what time it is "" i asked ."
""" no sure , maybe <#> or <#> o clock at night ."
"is n't it a pretty sight "" dave pointed out of the window where we had a wonderful view over the <UNK> on the city lights "" ."
"there were still a lot of noises from the streets , so we concluded that we must have been somewhere pretty much in the center of this huge city ."
"there was just a single large , thin bed sheet , no blankets whatsoever ."
dave went to see if there was any way of <UNK> the door from the inside to avoid having surprise visitors during the night .
he just moved a small <UNK> in front of the door so we would at least wake up from the noise when somebody tried to enter .
i hate to sleep in my <UNK> but then again there was already some sexual tension between us and i would n't want that to increase even further .
dave seemed to sense what i was thinking about .
"he said "" let 's just pretend we were brother and sister otherwise our stay here could become pretty uncomfortable ."
there 's no point trying to hide anything as you already found out .
"who knows how many nights it 's going to be "" ."
"i was glad he saw it this way , he was such an <UNK> guy , i love that ."
"he did the same but when we both turned around , i was unable to just ignore what i saw ."
"my sister had n't <UNK> , quite the contrary ."
this guy had something unbelievable hanging there between his legs almost down to his knees .
"he was pretty stunned as well although he had already got a taste of my size today , he still could n't help to stare at me ."
"we stood there for a moment , then we laughed and got under that sheet we had to share ."
we said good night and each turned to different sides of the bed .
it was so hot in the room and i could n't stop thinking about our situation .
but i do n't know how many hours later i woke up from the sound of voices somewhere on the same floor .
first it was difficult to hear but then a door was <UNK> opened and the voices became much clearer .
<#> of the girls were speaking spanish and occasionally a few broken english words .
the <#> were laughing and giggling all the time .
for a moment i thought about getting into contact with them but i was n't certain at all what role they were playing .
after a while the giggling mixed with soft <UNK> .
at the same time the european girl seemed to be <UNK> .
"as the <UNK> became more intense , dave woke up ."
he looked at me but i was acting asleep .
he lifted the bed sheet a bit and i felt that he was watching my body .
the voice of the girl next door became more <UNK> .
she repeated something in spanish over and over again until she was interrupted by the other mexican girl .
"they seemed to argue about something , then it was silent for a while ."
after a few minutes the <UNK> started again but this time it was the other girl .
i <UNK> because i was curious what he was doing .
but i could n't hold back <UNK> from time to time .
suddenly our door was pushed open banging against the <UNK> we had moved in front of the door .
"for a moment i had thought they were here to rescue us but they immediately started to shout <UNK> in spanish , kicking against the <UNK> ."
then <#> of them went out again and pushed a frightened european looking couple into the room .
they were both naked and had their hands tied behind their backs .
she was a tall blond in her <UNK> slim and quite <UNK> actually for a woman .
her hair was long and straight hanging down to her hips .
"he was much younger than her , maybe in his beginning <UNK> ."
"not too massive , slim , <UNK> and well equipped though not quite as well as dave ."
i realised that it was the same crying i had heard during the night .
her crying <UNK> the guards or whatever their role was .
<#> of them shouted at the woman to stop and slapped her in the face .
she walked around the bed and seemed rather amused about our situation .
both mexican girls were <UNK> and had <UNK> beautiful faces .
the guard lifted the bed sheet at the foot end with her <UNK> .
"she <UNK> , then she looked again and laughed ."
she said something funny sounding in spanish that made the other guard turn around to look as well .
then both laughed and <UNK> us to get out of bed .
"confronted with <#> <UNK> and some other <UNK> in the <UNK> of the <#> girls , we did as we were told ."
"dave tried to quickly grab his jeans but <#> of the mexican girls kicked them away laughing while saying "" no , no , no , no "" ."
i folded my arms in front of my breasts which obviously was n't very effective .
i noticed the european guy <UNK> me closely as my massive <UNK> spilled below and above my arms .
but dave 's features were certainly even more unusual .
i was staring just as all the others hat his horse cock while we were standing by the bathroom door .
"the mexican girls were talking with each other , giggling and discussing something ."
then <#> of them grabbed the blond <UNK> hair and pulled her on her knees in front of her boyfriend .
"she grabbed the young guys <UNK> cock and slapped the woman on the back of her head saying "" suck it ! "" ."
the blond looked up to us and lowered her eyes again .
then she did as she was told and soon we could see the young guy 's dick grow in her mouth .
but the mexican girls did n't care much about the european couple .
they were more interested in dave 's reaction and i realised that this was the whole purpose of their little game .
it did n't take long until dave 's cock started to grow and point straight towards the <#> giggling mexican girls .
from my angle i had a good view on the full length of it and it was even bigger than i had thought the night before .
although it was such a <UNK> situation i could n't help but think about how he ever managed to actually fuck a girl with that tool without hurting her .
now <#> of the mexican guards started to talk to us with her heavy accent .
""" we are el <UNK> national para la <UNK> and you are prisoners of war ."
we will not hurt you if your families pay a <#> us dollars within a week .
"if we do n't have the money in a week , we will present your family with a little present and wait for another week ."
"you will now be able to witness what happens if you let the week pass . """
she smiled and turned around towards the european couple .
i was surprised how eagerly the blond woman was working on him .
the mexican girl removed the tape from his mouth and kissed him deeply and <UNK> .
"then she said "" thanks for last night "" and smiled at him ."
"the young guy looked tense , he <UNK> his nice muscles , he opened his mouth and <UNK> "" oh yeah baby do n't stop now ! "" ."
"but now the other mexican girl went over to him , looked him in the eyes and said "" too bad we still have n't got the money "" ."
then she lifted her <UNK> and drove it down between his belly and the blond woman 's face .
she fell backwards with his <UNK> cock in her mouth .
he just stared down along his body shaking his head silently .
it was a horrible sight of this young sexy guy having his cock chopped off .
and i did n't quite understand the <#> girls .
they seemed to have had so much fun with him last night .
"i looked at dave whose cock was still standing <UNK> like a <UNK> and said "" we should better get that money do n't you think ? """
"then he said "" no that ca n't happen ."
"it must not happen to me ! "" ."
the mexican girls pushed the european couple out of the room .
they had given us the lesson they wanted and we certainly got the message .
was the company so <UNK> that getting stoned seemed the better option ?
this is the perfect example of why <UNK> of females can not flock together .
"some <UNK> about men , others about alcohol , others about "" other "" ."
i guess i should start by giving some background about myself .
"this is a good thing , for now ."
"i am single ( but i live with my best friend and he is male ) i love kids , but i do n't want to have <#> ."
i love this place i consider myself very lucky <UNK> there are a few things missing .
i like to order things just to get mail besides the <UNK> clearing house <UNK>
"so , this is the first entry and i could try to be really <UNK> and start posting the journal that i have been keeping for years ."
but i am no where near ready for that .
the mud all over the floor ( bye bye security deposit ) <#> .
the fact that i have n't really moved in here yet .
"that i love the dog , but she is obsessed with mud ."
i have to clean out the fridge today and i do n't want to .
i just bid on something that i could have bought new for less ( next time research before you bid ) <#> .
that shipping to hawaii is <UNK> <UNK> <#> .
<UNK> ( this goes back to <UNK> customers )
<#> . people who are afraid of water ( word of advice : do n't go <UNK> ! )
"if you 're at work and looking for an excuse to fool around on the internet for <#> minutes , check out <UNK> ."
i have had all the calm <UNK> out of me ..............
i have a thing for this <UNK> cowboy from the old <UNK> .
"maybe not even them , maybe just the image of them ."
i have a thing for something that does n't exist .
"unless you go here , thanks to the internet i can find people who fit my weird little <UNK> ... .... ...."
i need to pay more attention to those damned <UNK> commands .............
i keep <UNK> what i have written before i can save it .
"well , i guess it will give me time to <UNK> what i was writing ."
drove to the shop to pick up the truck and equipment and as usual karen had coffee for me .
i would marry her if she were a man and not already married to <UNK> .
but just the fact that she has coffee ready for me every morning is so <UNK> of her .
even though sometimes i suspect that she thinks that there is something between her husband and me .
"( nothing , i swear , not my style ) ."
when the wife walked down the <UNK> towards the truck she had a huge <UNK> of case o ' beer .
"i thought "" uh , okay .... interesting choice of <UNK> <UNK> """
but she had just cleaned up the upper parking area and was throwing the trash away .
"i had hope , these seemed like good people to spend the morning with ."
got them loaded onto the <UNK> and off we went .
it was <#> of those days were the <UNK> could do anything
so i took a <UNK> and headed towards the <UNK> site that i like .
"we made it in good time no <#> <UNK> the water , good thing ."
i <UNK> the <UNK> and we went <UNK> ' .
nothing out of the usual but the usual is pretty damn nice here .
"nothing that <UNK> happened , but by the time i had loaded the equipment back on the trailer , i just felt calm ."
there was a local guy eating <UNK> and he offered me some and we sat and talked while eating <UNK> .
i told him next time i would bring some hot sauce for it .
"<UNK> is <UNK> for "" sticks to you "" ."
i wrote an whole entry and then hit the close window button ( that should n't have happened today ) .
i was attempting to talk about how i have decided to take the journal in a different direction than i had planned .
sarah started to follow that path but discovered her own truth and self and stopped it .
( ps i will be using their real names because this is real . )
"sarah might get mad , but <UNK> is dead and can not get mad about it , too late . and"
"our mother , she died <#> years after <UNK> ."
"me , on the other hand , i ate my way through my <UNK> ."
i have been attempting for a <UNK> to write about alot of the things that have happened to me .
the self - criticism that originally came from an external source <UNK> its anger and starts the beating .
i imagine it being read by someone else and it sounds horrid .
so today i have published some of it here ... .... .... .... ....
".... you be the judge . and do n't worry , you ca n't hurt me more than i have hurt myself ."
"paragraph <#> : snow , summer and a horse that ate our apples off of the <UNK> ."
it was always a battle for my mother to get me to eat meat .
she would seat us down to a sunday dinner of beef <UNK> and i could smell the dread before i even saw it .
it would sit on my plate for so long that it turned to an even more disgusting <UNK> <UNK> than i had <UNK> before .
"and then the battle began , i had to sit at my plate until i could force this thing down ."
"i ultimately thought of this as a form of stuffing , stuffing down the <UNK> i could feel just below my throat ."
they were sitting waiting for any reason to come out .
i had no sympathy for my mother at that time .
at the moment she only existed to make me eat this painful mess .
"if i could manage to eat this then i was <UNK> , to me it made no sense and yet i <UNK> for the love behind the praise ."
and so i would try my best to choke it all down .
<UNK> only managed <#> tonight ... forgot that england beat mexico on the way to winning the <#> world cup .
did n't know that <UNK> has <#> <UNK> on their shirts next season
either ... saw steve and karen from the robin hood who had turned up at the pub for their night off .
they said that they were too busy for a quiz night .
not that useful for lots of teams of <#> or <#> fighting over somewhere to sit !
so looks like we 're stuck with the <UNK> !
"we had <#> goes at the safe tonight , drawing <#> of our <#> <UNK> tickets out !"
but neither alan or myself managed to crack it !
another <UNK> of our own £ <#> to the <UNK> christmas fund then ! ho hum ...
"well , i 'm back from the <UNK> . and"
a huge crowd of <UNK> fans arrived to the centre at around <#> pm and they were great to have on - <UNK> and yelling ! !
it was a moment i will never <UNK> for an hour and a half
i found a great new way of making money on the internet and it is really cool !
hey all ! what 's been going on in the last little bit ?
"well , my son <UNK> visited from thompson , mb for <#> and a half weeks and we really enjoyed having him there ! !"
we spent <#> - <UNK> at misty lake <UNK> in <UNK> and had a great time !
i drove <UNK> home and spent over <UNK> on the road and was really freakin tired when i got home.. than i had to work the next day !
i am now getting ready for the road again !
"i was asked to host the <UNK> concert this friday , august 6th , at the gordon <UNK> arena on the <UNK> ."
<UNK> was <#> of my favourite bands when i was growing up .
"if you ever lived in the west end of <UNK> around <#> - <#> , you know what i <UNK> was my <#> 's ! !"
"anyways , tha band unfortunately broke up and i still wish danny the <UNK> still is a kick ass <UNK> a bit of an ego ."
"anywho , i got to get back into the studio , i 'll post y'all on how the <UNK> concert went ."
"if any of you are from the <UNK> or <UNK> , drop by and say hi eh ?"
"i 'll also be at the <UNK> inn , saturday doing the "" western hour "" at <UNK> this is <UNK> signing off for now.. <UNK> !"
i ca n't understand why people in front of me are afraid to miss the red light .
are they afraid of actually getting where they 're going ?
is there something horrible there that they need to <UNK> the time they spend away from it ?
i suppose for most people this is their jobs .
if you do n't like a job then do n't do it .
"if you want to offer me any <#> of the thousands of excuses most people do , forget it ."
i have listened to the most common ones and do n't agree with any of them .
"even still , if people are afraid to go to work , then why is the commute home just as slow ?"
surely they must be happy that they made it out of their job alive and <UNK> now )
so why do they not wish to return home quickly ?
"as far as i 'm concerned , the freeway is for driving as fast as the law <UNK> and getting to where you 're going as fast as possible ."
"why does n't anyone else want to get to where they 're going <UNK> . , all day every day ?"
"it 's fine for what it is , but it 's not fast enough for me ."
i seriously need a blog that i can post to from my brain with no effort .
at least not the way this is supposed to work .
"i need a medium that i can <UNK> my thoughts to as they happen , because that is where the action is ."
i always find myself having thoughts to myself out loud which would be great <UNK> to this thing if they were posted as soon as they occurred .
i do n't see why this should n't be <UNK> someday .
"seriously , the brain is essentially a <UNK> parallel computer which is run by very low - level electrical current ."
"yeah , it sounds like an <UNK> , but eventually we 'll be able to do better brain <UNK> and brain <UNK> ."
the hard part will be figuring out the brain - blog interface .
"it essentially <UNK> down to this : "" be happy with the <#> you love because they 're the only <#> you 've got . "" i think ."
"whatever it was , it was a waste of <UNK> grant 's talent and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> 's fabulous <UNK> <UNK> -- no pun intended ) ."
"thanks to some good connections , i have a gmail account ."
"if you do n't know what gmail is , it 's google 's email service that is currently in beta testing ."
"i could tell you how i got my account , but suffice it to say , "" i know a guy who knows a guy "" ."
"in any case , it 's pretty nice , but nothing terribly exciting ."
"they give you up to a gig of storage , and they do n't expect you to throw anything away ."
i have a total of maybe <#> messages so far .
maybe i should tell somebody my address so they can send me something ?
"all in all , nothing terribly exciting to report ."
weekend was productive due to the fact that the boys from california were in town doing their semi - annual disaster recovery test which i gladly helped out on .
"not that that i do much , i just do the <#> <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> and then they do the testing ."
but i get to hang out with old buddies and get free food out of it .
"in the immortal words of bruce lee park : "" i may not be hungry , but i can always eat . """
"this is not "" <UNK> , "" she is definitely the complete package ."
"i 'm so stupid , i should have gotten her name ."
it not like she was n't wearing a name tag or anything ...
people have decided to remind me that i am now <#> years older than i was when i was born . as if i really care ...
i still feel like i did in 9th grade .
except now i have less hair on my head and more fat around my stomach .
i have decided to limit posting of comment to registered users for the simple fact that i want to know who the hell you people are .
"if you have something to say , do n't hide behind the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> , that 's my job ."
i have decided to <UNK> myself <UNK> christ after the phrase i seem to find myself <UNK> as i drive my car virtually anywhere .
not to mention my buddy <UNK> ) suggested i might want some measure of <UNK> on this forum .
"ok , so <UNK> christ it is .... nice ."
urllink in case you were curious where i fit into the grand scheme of things .
"pretty much all over the place , i 'd say ."
"well , in some ways ... like test - taking ."
i just got them today and i 've already signed up to re - take them in august .
today marks the start of what will probably turn out to be an exercise in <UNK> .
i will try and post as often as i can but can not guarantee anything because i am a <UNK> .
like computer geeks need another way to get fat .
being sold at urllink <UNK> is this : urllink <UNK> .
"that 's right , an <UNK> - bake oven for your cd - <UNK> bay ..."
"what a total waste of engineering , hardware , electricity , time , you name it , it 's a waste of it ."
i have missed everyone for so long and think it 's great that we are all trying to keep in touch again .
"i did go to our <#> year reunion thinking i would get to see everyone from our "" gang "" , but nobody !"
that was the whole reason i went and so excited about this .
well let me let you in on what 's been going on in my life ... the short version .
"i have done the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> er and now gave up working nights , weekends , and holidays to work at a special needs day care ."
"i love it , but am a little bored , but being bored is n't a bad thing ."
it 's a lot less stress and the kids are great .
i did get married in <#> to a guy who i thought was the best .
he decided to like guys instead of girls and we got divorced in <#> .
i did some travel nursing for a few years and ended back in florida .
i bought a house and then met the most wonderful man in the world .... <UNK> .
we just got married june 26th of this year .
we have been together for <#> years and this is the <#> !
they are our kids for now ... who knows about the future .
my parents are still at the same house 15th and <UNK> ave .
if you are in the neighborhood you should pop in and tell them hello they would love it .
well that is my life in a nut shell and will keep posting as long as everybody else does .
i did change my name it 's now lisa <UNK>
"<UNK> wanted us to post our <UNK> on here , so here is mine ."
"we have <#> <UNK> do n't call them step - children ) : <UNK> is <#> , she is a <UNK> - tech in chicago ."
she is married to <UNK> <UNK> ) who is from <UNK> and is <UNK> to paint new houses in the chi - town area .
she has an <UNK> in business through <UNK> north <UNK> .
she is currently pursuing a degree in <UNK> from the main campus of <UNK> .
she is going to greece this fall on a scholarship .
she is her third year of <UNK> for the pipe - <UNK> .
"she is engaged to will , who is an <UNK> <UNK> ."
"all <#> girls are trying to have kids , so i may be a grandma soon ."
"also , bob and i are trying to have a child ."
"if boy , <UNK> <UNK> , if twin boys , then the second <#> will be named : <UNK> micheal james ."
"for our first girl : catherine marie , if twin girls the second <#> will be named : amber <UNK> marie ."
it 's so hard to believe that it 's been <#> years since high school !
it 's great to hear what everyone is up to and find out how they 've spent those years .
"i spoke with lisa <UNK> on friday and sent her the invitation to this blog - i think robin did also , so hopefully she 'll be online soon ."
"hey - in the "" missing list "" - how about mike <UNK> and matt <UNK> ?"
"the summer of ' <#> provided the kids with some epic days at the <UNK> , their faces are always a picture and the stories ever more <UNK> ."
"urllink picture detail this particular fish was caught at a <UNK> near <UNK> , caught by alice on a pole and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> ."
"making the most of a cold winter in <UNK> having tried skiing , and having <#> bad knees i managed convincing myself <UNK> would be easier ."
"hmmm not so sure this was the best thing to try <#> week in , but i did make it through ."
urllink picture detail this ended up being <#> of the last sessions of the season .
i am lead to believe that you can <UNK> in the summer though .
"ok so it looks like a painted garden shed , and technically you may well be correct ."
"however to the kids it is a brand new "" wendy house / fort / <UNK> den "" that peter pan would be proud of ."
"so if you speak to them remember , "" do not mention the shed ! ! ! """
"there are qualities , that most new <UNK> teachings call the qualities of god ."
"my favorite list is abundance , balance , beauty , freedom , harmony , joy , love , order , peace , unity , <UNK> , wisdom ."
"what i call god is all possibility , all potential , existing in a <UNK> everywhere ."
you can see that with your own <UNK> how much sand is on the <UNK> quite enough as it is in all of life .
"now , how i feel and believe in relationship to abundance is how i am experiencing <UNK> ."
"most of us are some where in between , are n't we ?"
"the universe is joy and i , my believe in joy experience and express happiness !"
some people believe in a lack of joy and they experience a lack of joy !
"either we see balance or lack of <UNK> and our experience is chaos or order , depending on our belief ."
see pleasing things or the lack of pleasing things ....
"literally we attract to our <UNK> our sight , feeling , touching , tasting that very thing we think we deserve to have ."
we either attract our good or our lack of good . abundance or lack of abundance .
i have a tendency to ramble ... to <UNK> here 's to finding our way in this world by just including what we want in our thoughts !
"here 's to group spiritual practices ... for more about me and what i do , visit urllink"
these little units <UNK> in a closet somewhere ( usually close the the place that 's using the water ) and provides hot water on demand .
"jenny and i are thinking we should get <#> when we build our retirement house . anyhow , as per usual , i 'm starting with <UNK> on yahoo ."
right now we 're # <#> for the ' <UNK> water <UNK> ' term ( i 'm not kidding ) so we have a ways to go .
<#> thing is for certain in my research : yahoo likes things a whole lot differently than google does .
at least there appears to be a bit of logic to yahoo . :-)
"we 're still very <UNK> placed on all search engines for the french <UNK> terms , with the exception of <UNK> ."
<UNK> -- may have to come up with another acceptable solution for them .
"on the other terms , we 're seeing progress with yahoo again ."
"specifically , it <UNK> our ' urllink neck exercises ' page and moved us from <UNK> position to 28th ."
i still have n't had any time to look at the <UNK> contest -- and today will be no exception .
"interestingly , this contest has taken a non - <UNK> word from <#> to just shy of <#> pages in google 's index in just under <#> weeks !"
no wonder this business is n't getting any easier ! :-)
"things are improving for <UNK> . in just <#> re - <UNK> of the <UNK> page ,"
"yahoo moved the page from <UNK> to <UNK> . still not where i want it to be , but a definite improvement ."
i added some product page links into the urllink <UNK> systems - <UNK> <UNK> products page .
we 'll see in a couple of days if this moves the page up at all in the <UNK> .
the <UNK> pages have n't been re - <UNK> yet .
i 'll check again tomorrow to see how they did .
<UNK> - o - <UNK> is my latest challenge .
i started by looking at the results within yahoo for the <UNK> term -- ' urllink <UNK> ' .
<#> was just a photograph in a page with a title of ' <UNK> ' .
"obviously , getting found this way wo n't do anything for the customer ."
nobody is going to phone someone about a spot <UNK> just based on a photograph .
there are <#> sides to a successful search engine marketing project .
"as a good friend of mine in the <UNK> world says , ' people buy from people . '"
"anyhow , i <UNK> the architecture of the page being visited frequently by yahoo and we 'll see how this affects our <UNK> ."
almost all of the text content stayed the same -- other than removing some <UNK> tag paragraphs .
we 'll check in a couple of days to see how it does .
"if the new architecture is good , we 'll apply it to the other pages ."
i spent a <UNK> amount of time yesterday <UNK> the search engine <UNK> competition for <UNK> systems .
they are in a technology field ( <UNK> conference systems ) which tends to be quite competitive from a search engine marketing perspective .
"not a ton of competing pages for their terms , but lots of <UNK> <UNK> for the search engines ' attention ."
"i added <UNK> content to pages related to the <UNK> urllink <UNK> and <UNK> urllink <UNK> products -- possibly too much , in fact ."
"<#> of the pages has something like <#> words on it , while i usually like them much less than that ."
yahoo has included these pages in its index and returns to them very frequently so i 'm going to see how it <UNK> to this new content .
"if i can get yahoo to like us relative to the competition , i expect the other major search engines will like us too !"
i created <#> more <UNK> to finish the first round of <UNK> to canadian <UNK> - <UNK> site .
"it took a while to do each <#> , but by the time i was done , it was moving along at a good clip ."
then i created the ' urllink detailed drill bit information ' page which uses those <UNK> .
it came together very quickly and <UNK> the <UNK> content very well .
now we just need to hurry up and wait for the search engines to crawl through these pages again .
did another <#> for canadian <UNK> - <UNK> .
this <#> is a <UNK> to include a table of urllink <UNK> <UNK> bits ( for bell <UNK> ) that the company <UNK> .
"by the time <#> finds , <UNK> and <UNK> the table into database , we 're looking at about an hour per product line ."
"however , the content being provided is much better than what was there previously ."
will have to do the same for the other products .
it appears like the top <#> or <#> <UNK> for <UNK> ( the <UNK> for the canadian <UNK> competition ) has <UNK> .
"i 've updated the content at my urllink <UNK> dedicated domain page , plus some of the stuff at the <UNK> urllink <UNK> non - dedicated page ."
i still need ot spend more time on this .
perhaps more time will be available on the upcoming long weekend .
"however , since i ca n't work on all of our ' not - found ' clients at once , we 're going to <UNK> into it ."
"i 've spent a ton of time <UNK> into google logic ( or lack thereof ) , particularly with canadian <UNK> - <UNK> site ."
"i have some things , now , that i want to try out ."
that is ultimately the name of the game .
"the bad news is that we have no first page <UNK> , yet ."
"google <UNK> have occurred <UNK> ( <#> results ) , <UNK> ( <#> results ) , <UNK> ( <#> results ) , <UNK> ( <#> results ) ."
i gave my <UNK> at work and feel like a weight is off my shoulders .
"is yelling between my ears , "" free at last , free at last ... "" -- you get the picture i 'm sure ."
"<#> , <#> which gives me a couple weeks before <UNK> off to get this next step in the adventure that is my life going ."
i ca n't wait to end this job and get some version of life back ( a word of advice to anyone who thinks working nights is good ...
"dream on ... it 's good if you do n't like living ) look out world , here i come !"
<UNK> tattoo and piercing artist brent <UNK> shows off his own new facial piercings and ink work on sat .

"<#> , <#> . photo from canadian press urllink"
of course it was <#> degrees hotter on the stage we were on than anywhere else .
"of course , no <#> had even the <UNK> idea of which stage we were supposed to go to or where it was ."
( not just band members .... fair staff ) .
of course the first thing i did upon arrival and <UNK> was smash the shit out of <#> of my <UNK> fingers .
of course that still hurts like a <UNK> .
um and we were pretty damn good i gotta say .
"oh and <UNK> <UNK> on my profile over by the <UNK> <UNK> , cos"
there 's a really freakin <UNK> picture of me there .
"i mean , pictures of me this good roll around once a century ."
a dozen years or so of cultural <UNK> passed me right by .
i sometimes feel like death must have when he went for a visit .
i do n't relate with most pop culture unless it has something to do with music .
speaking of death .... there 's something very strange about death being a virgin .
"<UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> for a shot of "" <UNK> "" for this afternoon ."
got <UNK> super strong coffee on ( and <UNK> down my <UNK> ) .
"<UNK> for fried egg <UNK> on toast , with toast on the side , are <UNK> ."
i 'm not nearly half this <UNK> when we play .
i have no idea why this <#> - hour show at the county fair has me all wound up .
"<UNK> looks at you with a <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> her coffee cup in her hand ."
"yes my dear <UNK> , it was almost a ... "" spiritual experience "" ."
i think that cup <UNK> is kind of like signing the cross right ?
"i really do n't understand the <UNK> ' attraction to that <UNK> - <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ."
she must have dropped them on their heads when they were babies or something .
then i stuck my finger in my eye .
"oh , it 's not just selling things or yourself ."
my religion requires faith and hope . and lots and lots of eye <UNK> .
"or , it could have been any speech by any politician ."
any idiot on the phone who i did not ask to call me .
"there are proven methods to selling your stuff , your ideas , your platform , your self ."
look what other <UNK> you 're happily eating .
you like it because it 's cool to like it .
"it does n't matter if it tastes like cardboard and looks like <UNK> <UNK> worms , everyone else says it 's good so you eat it ."
you <UNK> the peer pressure and your peers are all drinking the same <UNK> <UNK> as you .
"you can never escape it , and you will never escape it . "" better than them "" is an addiction and you 're the hype ."
"we will always be around to sell you things you do n't need , and we can always convince you to buy them because you need them ."
"everyone else does , and if they are n't buying it too , they just do n't know any better ."
"you may have noticed as you entered the state , big green signs that say you are to stay in the right lane unless you 're passing ."
"i was never really a <UNK> <UNK> pitt fan , but i gotta say , "" meet joe black "" might have turned me into <#> ."
"i think perhaps * <UNK> would have suited the part well , too ."
"well , <UNK> , it 's all about me ."
"urllink if you remember what this lovely creature is , you should be around my age ."
go to this link to learn more about it : urllink <UNK> weird .
"anywho , click on the above link to view the official the village site ."
i did not read anything about it prior to seeing it because i wanted to keep the <UNK> of not knowing what it was about .
"came home and was curious about the reviews and went to urllink rotten tomatoes and i could not believe it , the movie was <UNK> !"
"i thought it was very <UNK> , fresh , <UNK> , scary , dramatic , and romantic ."
the acting worked for me and the cast was strong .
"i do n't get it . if you saw it tonight ( or any other time after this ) , what did you think ?"
"urllink summer is here , time to buy my urllink <UNK> <UNK> !"
i have never been able to figure out what this saying means .
"not quite sure why i am thinking about it right now , but i decided to do a search ."
"the very first entry , this is what it said : <UNK> did shakespeare coin the phrase "" the world is my <UNK> "" ?"
"my memory has changed over the years , ca n't remember stuff quite like i used to ."
"i believe that i have paid my <UNK> , in full ."
"it 's late , thus the urllink <UNK> of the hour is formed ."
"yes , i am <#> of love lost 's children and recently fresh ."
"it hurts bad , and i need a release ."
writing can be a very powerful instrument and also oddly enough a healing tool .
"not as good as urllink chocolate , but heck , fairly close in my book ."
<#> can only hope that this blog will help <UNK> my shattered heart .
maybe it will help you with yours too .
i have so many things i need to do .
"with my current state of <UNK> , i have n't done <UNK> in nearly a month ."
"the most important thing , keep <UNK> my resume for a job ."
i have not worked on at all in a month .
my goal is to start up again this week .
"i had it on urllink craig 's list , but it has since <UNK> ."
"i also have to consider posting it on say something like , urllink <UNK> and , ugh .... ebay ."
"i really want to try and sell it on my own first , pay no listing fees nor have any commission taken out ."
i have to finish my last <UNK> b <UNK> shot ( you have to do a series of <#> ) and also get a <UNK> <UNK> .
"since i currently do not have any health insurance ( i know bad ) , <UNK> has been heaven sent for me ."
"i am not going to get into this because this is far too personal , but i am having a battle with the ultimate worst ...... the <UNK> ."
"enough said , believe me , stress city ."
"started taking <UNK> natural , a urllink <UNK> 's product based off of urllink <UNK> extra strength ."
hopefully this product will help me with my hot flashes .
"urllink black <UNK> <UNK> "" is the wonder <UNK> when it comes to this type of situation ."
"i do not know what it is , but it was in every box of "" <UNK> "" type of <UNK> that <UNK> 's had ."
i will do some research on it and report in another blog listing .
"other than that , no new news or happenings ."
"i am bored , <UNK> , <UNK> , and well , feeling like a loser ."
"other than that , i still have my positive attitude ."
i 've been sleep deprived for over a year now .
sleep used to be almost a hobby for me - i loved it !
"i should be in bed now as everyone else is sleeping , but that means i have some time to myself ."
"sean woke up <#> time last night , but hopefully tonight he 'll go back to sleeping through the night ."
"they both cried , but seemed to make a pretty easy transition ."
"i would roll from <#> side to the other nursing emma and sean , sometimes as often as every <#> minutes - it was absolutely exhausting ."
it was a good night if i had a <#> hour stretch of sleep .
"it is much better now , but i still crave a full night of sleep ."
i am trying to transition emma to the pack - and - play to get her a little more <UNK> from me .
she likes to nurse on and off throughout the night and is very vocal when she wakes up .
i do n't have air conditioning in my apartment .
"hardly anyone here grew up with air conditioning at home , but today it 's considered a necessity ."
"mostly , this is not a problem : i live in an old ( and <UNK> )"
"urllink <UNK> building with high <UNK> , and my apartment does n't get a lot of direct sunlight ."
"tonight , however , it 's particularly hot and humid , and the air just is n't moving ."
the cold shower did n't help ; i ca n't sleep .
"so i 'm waiting for the magic hour before dawn , when the humidity <UNK> a bit , and meanwhile"
i 'm reading the urllink new <UNK> online .
"i just finished <UNK> <UNK> 's very intelligent and beautifully written urllink review of bill clinton 's <UNK> , "" my life ."
""" i particularly like this bit : "" ... the book is shaped by political <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"but presidential <UNK> seldom take full advantage of the freedom to be frank , and clinton ’s is no exception ."
"her husband must therefore consider the impact on her political <UNK> of everything he says , does , or writes ."
"he might like to fire off something <UNK> about israel , for example , or the <UNK> in miami , or the <UNK> unions ."
"if this is hillary ’s revenge , it is <UNK> . """
usa today reported that someone in the bush campaign said that people who are in crap jobs should either find a different job or take <UNK> .
"that sounds like typical republican "" favour the rich and <UNK> the mentally ill "" attitude ."
", i 'm unemployed due to my mental illness ."
<#> minutes in - line skating just got back from skating for about an hour with doug and wendy .
"nice to have some company , though it 's hard to carry on really good conversations with having to skate in single file ."
found a great little coffee shop on <UNK> that 's right near where i end my skating .
"i 'll head back there , especially since she does n't mind if we come in on <UNK> ."
<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : okay today 's workout ( from the <UNK> site ) : <UNK> <#> - minute <UNK> walk .
then alternate <#> seconds of jogging and <#> seconds of walking for a total of <#> minutes .
i think i 'm going to have to switch to <UNK> .
i just got back from my third run of the week and it 's 1:30 .
up too late last night which meant i was hungry when i went to bed .
we 'll try <UNK> for a while and see how it goes .
i 'm still barely making it through the <#> second running <UNK> - i 'm not sure i could switch to <#> at this point .
"feeling a bit stronger now than i did on tuesday , but i think i 'll have to do the "" <UNK> couch to <UNK> . """
"oh , well , as long as i 'm making progress ! going skating with wendy and doug this afternoon , too ."
"i 've paid my <UNK> with running , now i get to have fun with skating ."
"i will stick this running thing out to the <UNK> , but at some point , it had better start getting more fun !"
<#> <UNK> walks energy level : a little low this afternoon i walked down to <UNK> and back to meet some friends for <UNK> .
"it 's probably a little less than a mile from my office to <UNK> , so it was a nice bit of bonus exercise ."
i have plans after work and i think my <UNK> need a break anyway .
<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : okay another day of urllink couch to <UNK> this morning .
today 's workout ( from the <UNK> site ) : <UNK> <#> - minute <UNK> walk .
then alternate <#> seconds of jogging and <#> seconds of walking for a total of <#> minutes .
i wonder if i 'm ever going to love running or even like it .
"everyone who does says "" stick with it . "" and i know that burning lungs and a nice high heart rate are a good thing ."
"i took my <UNK> after <#> of the running <UNK> and it was at about <#> , which is about as far as i want to push it ."
"i know it 's good for me , but that <#> minutes of running felt longer than <#> minutes of skating did last night ."
but i also probably accomplished as much in a shorter period of time .
"i run over at adams elementary school , which is just a <#> minute ( or so ) walk from my house ."
i circle the <#> softball fields that are back - to - back .
"i do n't have to get in my car and go somewhere , and the surface is either grass or dirt ."
"but otherwise , it 's a good place to start though"
i 'm sure i 'll get bored and will want to hit green lake or the <UNK> - <UNK> at some point .
"<#> minutes in - line skating <#> minutes <UNK> ( home ) hit the <UNK> - <UNK> trail on my <UNK> again , this time going significantly farther ."
"but once i get better , i 'll probably skate down the back roads to get to the trail ."
today i went all the way to the <UNK> bridge and back .
"for now , though , i 'm still <UNK> the tough spots ."
i do this whenever i learn new things - my brain takes over when i should let instinct reign .
"for now , i 'm mostly letting gravity and <UNK> stop me - not entirely comfortable with <UNK> ."
"every road crossing ( and there are a few , though most of them do n't have much traffic )"
"but it was a gorgeous night to be out , with a beautiful sunset , and i felt great ."
so things are a little sore this morning .
"i think between running and <UNK> , i <UNK> some long - <UNK> muscles ."
but nothing 's so painful that i do n't want to get out and do it all over again !
<#> minutes in - line skating energy level : high !
"so back in the summer of <#> , i was living in manhattan while working at <UNK> on a summer internship ."
"i learned to in - line skate that summer , and spent many a weekend day <UNK> around central park on my <UNK> ."
needless to say it 's been a while .
so tonight i stopped by <UNK> 's to see what they had to offer .
the high school kid ( a born <UNK> - the kid 's got a future ) talked me into a pair of urllink these .
"because it was getting dark and i had to pee , that was far enough - it 's probably <#> <#> miles from fred <UNK> to the bridge ."
"i need to get a little more confident with the brakes to really get fast , but for the most part , i felt comfortable today ."
<#> minute walk went for a <#> minute walk at lunchtime with steven .
"i 'd like to try to do that more often - it 's good for the body and good for the soul , especially in the summer ."
lots of stuff going on in my head today and it was really nice to just be out in the sun and talk through that . and
staring at something other than my monitor is a good thing .
"she said , "" no , no , i can tell you build muscle really easily - not every <#> can . """
"well , i 'm starting to get that i do have an athletic body ."
""" there 's always been muscle there , but now it 's finally starting to show !"
"wendy had recommended a store that a friend owns , and i 'll probably head up there ."
i realized that the last time i got <UNK> for a pair of running shoes was probably <#> * .
so it 's possible i should n't even be wearing the same shoes any more .
so i will be buying new shoes soon and going through a formal fitting process .
he said he could n't eat for <#> - <#> hours before he worked out .
"no way i can do that , i said ."
and it 's true that i ca n't do that for an evening workout .
"if i try to workout in the late <UNK> evening several hours after lunch , i have no energy and no <UNK> ."
"but i guess that 's different for me in the morning , because i <UNK> out of bed and did my workout this morning with no problem ."
i 'll just have to keep an eye on it and see if some mornings i need to eat something small before i go out .
"anyway , it 'll be fun to watch the progress and changes i can make by continuing to work out ."
"* no , i have n't worn the same pair for <#> years , i just keep buying the same <UNK> ."
<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : decent !
so i started urllink couch to <UNK> this morning .
today 's workout ( from the <UNK> site ) : <UNK> <#> - minute <UNK> walk .
then alternate <#> seconds of jogging and <#> seconds of walking for a total of <#> minutes .
<#> lbs ( what i 've lost since the last time i tried running ) makes a difference .
"i notice it day - to - day , and i noticed it this morning ."
"i felt lighter on my feet , and my lungs were n't burning quite as much ."
"last time i tried , i remember i could n't get through all of the running <UNK> ."
"today i did , though the lungs were burning by the end ."
"part of that 's that i 've been in some sort of <UNK> since last september , and the focus is always on gaining strength ."
part of it 's just that i do n't do it .
even the new activity i learned last year ( <UNK> ) requires more strength ( especially those <UNK> ) than <UNK> .
"not that it does n't require <UNK> , and i 'm looking forward to building up my <UNK> <UNK>"
so i can do those really long runs next year ( now that i do n't fall as much ! ) .
"i think i will go ahead and pick the <UNK> dash <UNK> in late october , as recommended by urllink karl ."
that gives me about <#> weeks to complete a <#> week training program .
this <UNK> i will probably end up repeating some weeks ( not that i 'll take weeks off entirely ) .
"if i 'm feeling up to an earlier race , i 'd definitely run it , but i 'm committing to <UNK> dash now ."
<#> minutes <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> energy level : high ! ah !
back to the gym after at least <#> weeks off .
i 've been a bit slack since shoulder surgery in april .
"not really an excuse since i could still do a lot , but i used it as <#> ."
"lucky me , i was bouncing off the walls with energy tonight , a good night to get back into the swing of exercising ."
"i did my usual gym routine tonight - pushed the pace a bit on the <UNK> , and threw in as much of everything else as i could take ."
"tomorrow , i 'm going to start the urllink couch to <UNK> running plan again ."
"now , i tried this back in september <#> , the last time i felt like i was losing focus ."
"i did it for <#> days , and promptly got hit by a car ."
"this time , i 'm hoping to be able to stick with it ."
in the next few days i 'll pick a <UNK> event some time in the <UNK> <UNK> as a goal .
"i went as far as <UNK> and back , and by that time it was <UNK> ."
"( i did stop for <#> minutes to chat with andy , who was out on a run ) ."
"i even wore my glasses , but by that point i could barely see ."
"summer 's coming to a close , slowly but surely ."
"where a month ago , <UNK> would have been plenty light , now ..."
i 'm trying desperately not to think about the idea of summer being over and having to come up with other options for working out .
"i 'm going to look into some of the classes at my gym , too , particularly yoga , but also some of the other classes as well ."
walk <#> yards ( or <#> seconds ) .
jog <#> yards ( or <#> minutes ) .
walk <#> yards ( or <#> minutes ) .
finally i did a full week <#> workout for urllink couch - <UNK> .
i got through that nagging second <UNK> running <UNK> .
"i 'll do it again on saturday , and assuming that goes well , i 'll attempt week <#> next week ."
"i think week <#> 's going to take a while , too ."
"<#> minutes <UNK> <#> minutes strength <UNK> there must be something about wednesday as "" bad body image day ."
"i 've always thought <UNK> surgery was <UNK> vain ( or at the very least , an external fix for internal problems ) ."
i 've always maintained that plastic surgery was <UNK> only in cases where someone 's been <UNK> or injured .
have i <UNK> my own body to the point where i can justify plastic surgery to myself ?
it 's not something i 'll think seriously about until at least a year after i 've reached my goal weight .
everything i 've read says that you need to wait that long to see how your skin springs back .
it 's definitely the <UNK> that 's driving these body image issues .
"it 's my desire to feel beautiful , to feel attractive , to be <UNK> for my body ."
"i suppose not being single would help that , but i also know that i need to find that peace with my own body ."
"i 'm not sure how to get there on the pure "" looking in the mirror "" side of things ."
i can focus on what i can do with my body that i could n't <#> months ago .
"tonight , carrie , who works at the gym , asked me if i was planning to <UNK> again this year ."
"she said "" set up some time with me and i 'll put together a training program for you to get you ready ."
""" she 's also trying to get a ski and <UNK> conditioning class added to the schedule at the gym ."
"a year ago i might have hoped i could , but"
"no , i definitely would n't have been able to ."
i got to thinking at the gym today - i should do something big to mark the occasion .
"celebrate the fact that despite the long road back , i 'm fully , <#> % back , weird - ass leg scars and all ."
"my body was bruised and <UNK> , but not broken ."
"it ' s the sunday of labor day weekend , and i was thinking of taking advantage of that weekend to get some of my <UNK> in anyway ."
maybe i 'll make a really huge deal of it and invite some friends to come out and see me dive then get lunch or something in <UNK> .
"i 'll try to focus on all the things i can do with my body , and all the power it gives me ."
"it 's hard to do that though , when what i really crave is <UNK> that it is an attractive body ."
i know most of that has to come from inside ...
"i ca n't wait around to get it from others ( though , damn , it would be nice to be <UNK> ! ) ."
"of course , after the first time i went skating , i <UNK> new muscles , too ."
but i realized my left leg felt a bit <UNK> than my right as well .
as i <UNK> with my boots trying to get both <UNK> feeling comfortable and stable at the same time i thought perhaps the boot fit was contributing .
but then i looked at how i was skating and realized that i definitely favor the left side .
i tend to push off harder from the left and coast a little more with the right .
so for the second part of my skate tonight i tried to pay more attention to pushing hard from the right .
"i also have n't been very good about stretching after skating , which is n't good ."
"i always stretch at the gym , and i always stretch after i run ."
i woke up feeling much better mentally and physically today .
"i need to find that balance between not cutting myself too much slack and getting lazy and listening to my body when it says "" no mas ! """
"today i talked to the wonderful folks at urllink <UNK> <UNK> and signed up for <#> ( count 'em , <#> ) jumps this weekend ."
"i 'm doing jumps <#> - <#> in the urllink static line <UNK> on saturday , and jumps <#> and <#> on sunday ."
"<UNK> , who was my instructor last weekend , was the <#> who called me back to schedule the <UNK> ."
"she confirmed that everyone from my class on saturday was able to successfully dive , though some provided her with more humor than others !"
she said they do n't normally recommend more than <#> <UNK> a day at this point - otherwise it becomes too mentally and physically <UNK> .
the full <UNK> to get <UNK> is approximately <#> jumps .
"if you go longer than <#> days between jumps , you have to start over from scratch , and that gets expensive and time - consuming ."
labor day weekend might be a chance to get some more in as well - i 'll check the <UNK> <UNK> and schedule around it .
"my whole body was saying "" hell no "" and i had to listen ."
"it was n't that any particular part of my body hurt , i 'm just <UNK> ."
i walked around downtown after work - probably <UNK> miles - doing some shopping .
i kept waiting for my energy to kick up a notch and it did n't .
"got home around 7:30 , cooked dinner , and gave myself permission not to go to the gym tonight ."
"i ran this morning , and will do something ( skating ? ) after work tomorrow ."
while i was shopping i got to thinking about sizes .
"clothing sizes in particular , and how they relate to how i see my body ."
i still have trouble picking something off a rack and looking at it and figuring out if it 's likely to fit .
"in june , i went to the <UNK> fair and saw an adorable skirt in <#> of the <UNK> ."
"i looked to see what sizes they had , and they had an <UNK> , a m , a s , and a <UNK> ."
""" i asked the women working the booth if they had a l in back ."
"<#> woman said "" nope , everything is out . """
"i said , "" oh well , that 's too bad , i really liked it . """
"i said "" no way in hell do i wear a medium . """
"she said "" our sizes run a little big - you can probably wear it . """
""" she pointed at the other woman working the booth and said "" she wears a medium in our clothes . """
"funny thing was , that did n't help me ."
"i could n't look at her and think "" oh , okay , i 'm about the same size ."
"i pulled the medium off the rack , looked at it and thought "" way too small . """
"but , <UNK> , i went into the dressing room , pulled my shorts off and tried the skirt on ."
"after i 'd worn the skirt , i hung it back on a <UNK> , and looked at it , and suddenly it looked huge ."
walk <#> yards ( or <#> seconds ) .
jog <#> yards ( or <#> minutes ) .
walk <#> yards ( or <#> minutes ) .
so i 'm still working on week <#> of urllink couch - <UNK> .
i <UNK> a little closer today - i got to <UNK> on the second <UNK> running <UNK> .
"if i do actually get through the week <#> <UNK> this week , i <UNK> ahead to week <#> and <UNK> ."
i 'm starting to confirm this is n't a realistic plan for me to complete in <#> weeks .
how many people * do * find this a realistic plan ?
i should pop around the cool running discussion boards a little more and see .
i checked the boards and found urllink this thread ( among many others ) .
<#> hour <#> minutes <UNK> skating energy level : good till the end
"then a bit <UNK> dragged <UNK> out on <UNK> today for the first time in a while ( and only her third time ever , i think ) ."
"i <UNK> from fred <UNK> to <UNK> to meet <UNK> at urban surf , but it turns out they do n't rent <UNK> any more ."
we split off then and she went back to her car and
"i 'm too lazy to do the math to figure out how far that is , but it 's probably about <#> miles or so for me ."
"well , i kept this kind of quiet - only told a few people i was going out ."
"i 've been talking about doing this for a long time , but unfortunately , for a long time i was over the weight limit of <#> lbs ."
"not anymore , so i officially had no more excuses ."
it was everything i 'd expected and nothing like what i expected .
"i signed up on monday , which did n't give me an awful lot of time to <UNK> it ."
"of course , that means no "" safety net "" of an instructor <UNK> to you ."
"yes , if everything goes right , the <UNK> is pulled for you by the static line , which is attached to the plane ."
"if everything goes wrong , you 're the only <#> who can pull that reserve <UNK> ."
you still have to <UNK> and pilot the <UNK> to the ground all by yourself .
"you 're being talked down by an instructor via radio , but ultimately , you have to know what to do and be able to get yourself down ."
it 's possible the radio will fail and you have to get yourself down .
that 's basically what you spend almost <#> hours going over before you can jump .
"<UNK> , our instructor , was a lot of fun and she made the class entertaining , but still very seriously discussed all the safety issues ."
we practiced getting in and out of the plane .
"they divided our class in to <#> "" loads "" of <#> students ."
"since i signed up pretty late , i was supposed to be in the last load , but they <UNK> a bit to <UNK> some groups ."
"since i was <#> of the "" singles "" i was put in with <#> out of a group of <#> ."
"they 'd reserved early , so i was in the very first load ."
"so i was the very first <UNK> , too ."
i think that was the best way to do it because it meant i did n't have much time at all after the end of class to <UNK> it .
"i just had to get ready , and go ."
"my diving partners were cody and <UNK> , who were visiting from <UNK> with <UNK> 's sisters and a friend from seattle ."
"the planes are so tiny , you pretty much have to make friends ."
"there 's the pilot 's seat , and space for the instructor ."
<UNK> <#> ( last <#> out ) <UNK> in behind the pilot with legs facing back .
<UNK> <#> ( cody ) sits in the back of the plane with legs facing forward .
<UNK> <#> ( me ) sits in between <UNK> <#> 's legs with legs facing forward .
"and that , literally , takes up every inch of space in the plane ."
"once you reach <UNK> , <UNK> opens the door of the plane , then tells you to slide towards the edge of the plane ."
"at that point , you put your feet out on a platform on the wheel , and get ready to grab the wing <UNK> ."
"which , as it turned out , made it easier for me ."
"i was so focused on the energy it took to do that , i did n't really have time to <UNK> myself out ."
"so you hold on to the wing <UNK> , move your hands far out the <UNK> , and <UNK> says "" step off and hang ."
""" once you do that , it 's seconds till you 're gone . if that ."
"it 's not for very long , and i forgot just about everything"
- you 're supposed to <UNK> your back and spread your legs and arms out .
"i managed to realize a couple seconds in that i needed to be <UNK> , and fortunately , your body kind of naturally goes in that position anyway ."
"i got through that , got my <UNK> about me enough to look up and realize my <UNK> had opened perfectly ."
"i got my first instructions on the radio , did a few test turns , then he told me to just settle in and enjoy the view ."
"i played around a bit with the <UNK> , just to get a feel for how it moved ."
the <#> minutes it takes was over pretty quickly .
before i knew it i was approaching the field .
"steve , the "" talk - down "" instructor , guided me through a nice , soft landing ."
i ca n't wait to go out again - i will probably schedule a couple of jumps for next weekend -
i 'm just going to jump ( pun intended ) into the urllink static line <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> and see how far i can get .
walk <#> yards ( or <#> seconds ) .
jog <#> yards ( or <#> minutes ) .
walk <#> yards ( or <#> minutes ) .
"once again , it 's that last running <UNK> that gets me ."
"it 's official , i 'm repeating week <#> next week ."
"<UNK> , i would n't run <#> mornings in a row ."
"but because of a super - early meeting on wednesday , i did n't get up to run then , so i ran yesterday ."
"i have early plans tomorrow morning , too , and tried my best to talk myself out of running at all the rest of the week ."
here 's a <UNK> from a little i m conversation last night that shows how hard i tried !
"fortunately , as you can see , the angel on my shoulder got some extra help ."
editor 's note : i m <UNK> left in for <UNK> :)
<UNK> : then you can enjoy sat morning [ <UNK> ] <UNK> : :) [ <UNK> ]
but i do n't want to get up tomorrow [ <UNK> ]
<UNK> : it 's either tomorrow or saturday [ <UNK> ]
: so get it <UNK> sooner [ <UNK> ] <UNK> : as i have <#> more day to run this week [ <UNK>
"<UNK> : besides , you 'll feel better when it is done [ <UNK> ] <UNK> :"
] <UNK> : but i do n't wanna [ <UNK> ]
<UNK> : i need to hit the hay [ <UNK> ]
<UNK> : <UNK> ! [ <UNK> ] <UNK> : goodnight [ <UNK> ]
"<UNK> : thank you , oh <UNK> [ <UNK> ]"
<UNK> : i will set my alarm early [ <UNK>
] <UNK> : when i 'm cursing [ <UNK> ]
"<UNK> : get to bed yourself , <UNK> <UNK> have to <UNK> and run [ <UNK> ]"
<UNK> : curse me all you want [ <UNK> ]
<UNK> : oh i will [ <UNK> ] <UNK> :
<UNK> fuck fuck parker fuck damnit i gotta get up [ <UNK> ] <UNK> : something like that :) [ <UNK> ]
", that 's about how the morning went when the alarm went off ."
some days i get like that and i ca n't put it into perspective .
perspective : i have friends who weigh <#> .
perspective : these urllink jeans were getting tight when i started .
"yes , i have both legs in <#> leg of the jeans ."
perspective : i 'm <#> % of the way to my goal .
""" i know in my head that 's not true , but it 's hard to remember sometimes ."
"but it 's nice to talk with someone else who 's made drastic changes in their <UNK> to know that the <UNK> , crappy body image days are normal ."
"the questions can <UNK> me when i 'm in the wrong mood , even though they generally come from a good place and i appreciate the encouragement ."
""" what 's up with couch to <UNK> ? """
"eric was asking about couch to <UNK> the other day , and i was telling him where i was in the program this week ."
"i started thinking "" he 's a runner , he probably thinks not being able to run <#> minutes is ridiculous . """
he 's also not carrying around <#> extra pounds .
"i thought "" i 'm running <#> minutes and i only remember passing that test once when i was a kid . """
"so hey , at least i 'm back to that level of fitness ."
"i want to say "" do you not get it ?"
"even if i never lose another pound , this is the way i eat now . """
"i ca n't go back to being on the sugar roller - coaster , which i firmly believe was the source of my <UNK> struggles with depression ."
and i realize i 'm a victim of my own success to some extent .
"i get asked this question all the time , by a bunch of different people ."
eric asks me the question regularly and it seems he ca n't understand why i would n't continue to lose weight at a regular pace .
and i 'm not angry at him - i know he 's trying to be supportive and has been throughout this whole thing .
"when i started on atkins , i posted regularly on a low - carb online <UNK> board ."
"i would read stories of people whose weight loss slowed or even <UNK> , even though they followed their plans to the letter ."
"i thought "" that wo n't happen to me . "" and for a long time , it did n't ."
i do n't really understand how my body works .
i think this last <#> lbs will take as long as the first <#> did to lose .
i 'll play around with things - right now i 'm trying to kick the exercise up a notch .
"i do n't know <UNK> i 'm going to see a direct impact on the scale from that , but i sure as hell feel better ."
"fact is , as easy as i 've made it look over the last <#> months , losing weight is hard ."
"once i got the <UNK> <UNK> down , it really was easy to drop the weight ."
the first <#> lbs came off so fast it surprised even me .
the last <#> have been much more hard - won .
the next <#> will probably drive me nuts . the good news ?
i know how to successfully maintain my weight loss .
"if i never lose another pound , that 's a good thing ."
"but damn , i just know this is going to be a day to day battle with my own demons ."
"i hope eventually they go away , but i know they probably wo n't ."
"[ edit ] i thought of <#> more thing on the "" victim of my own success "" thing ."
"i often find myself wondering if , when my weight loss <UNK> down , people wonder "" is she slipping ?"
""" here we go again . "" because , frankly , it 's been a pattern through my whole life"
- i can lose weight but i ca n't keep it off .
"what i think i ca n't explain ( and maybe it 's because i do n't fully understand why ) , is that this really is different ."
i 've never felt like i 'd made a permanent change .
"<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : good well , did n't quite make it through week <#> , day <#> , either ."

"! if it 's not the lungs , it 's the legs - today they were feeling <UNK> ."
glad i did - though i got started so late it was pretty dark by the time i was done .
"almost feeling like "" fuck it , why bother "" but i know better than to get caught up in that ."
<#> minutes <UNK> skating energy level : high ! today
i went out and <UNK> decided to kick it up a notch on the skating .
"i felt like i was pushing harder , and my heart rate definitely reflected it , but overall did n't end up shaving that much time off ."
"this puts me up to an average speed of <#> mph , which is at least getting me closer to the <UNK> "" minimum "" speed of <#> mph ."
i wonder who these people are who can go <#> mph on <UNK> !
- i have to be down at our <UNK> facility by 7:30 for a <UNK> visit that lasts till 2:30 .
<#> minutes <UNK> bike <#> minutes <UNK> energy level : good worked out at the gym tonight .
went out for a drink after work and by the time i got home
"ate really quickly and by that point it was too dark to skate , so i did the gym instead ."
"it was damn hot today , so the gym was n't the best place to be , but oh well ."
i 'll try to get some skating in tomorrow night .
"<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : good well , did n't quite make it through week <#> , day <#> ."
i made it almost all the way through the second <UNK> running <UNK> - about <UNK> .
"i <UNK> walking , but i need to get all the way to <#> minutes before i move on ."
i 'll just keep trying it every morning till i can get it .
i 'll just keep trying to stretch it .
"largely <UNK> weekend - went up to vancouver , did n't eat all that well and did n't exercise ( except running on saturday ) ."
"the scale reflected it this morning , so i need to go back to very very strict low - carb for a bit to shake things up ."
"just goes to show that after <#> months of doing this , i still need to make good decisions every single day ."
"i get on <UNK> and i think i can handle it , and it 's a slippery <UNK> to making bad choices again ."
<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : good from the <UNK> site : <UNK> <#> - minute <UNK> walk .
then alternate <#> seconds of jogging and <#> minutes of walking for a total of <#> minutes .
legs were a bit <UNK> today - not really in pain but just ... <UNK> .
"hey , last week i did n't think i could bump up to <#> seconds , so i 'll give it a shot ."
"all i can do is try , i suppose ."
so the devil on my shoulder won out this morning when it was raining pretty heavily at <#> when the alarm went off .
"<UNK> is <#> thing , rain 's entirely another ."
"it 's supposed to clear tomorrow , so i will get out and fit in <UNK> tomorrow morning ( must remember not to stay up ridiculously late tonight ) ."
does make me wonder how i 'm going to handle this once fall kicks in .
i guess i 'll just have to see .
"by then i 'll be more comfortable running in front of other people , so i can use the <UNK> at the gym . and"
"most days , it 's just <UNK> , so i just need to make sure i have the right gear to handle it ."
"i do n't want to get into the habit , but on mornings like this , it 's nice to be able to say "" hell no . """
"so , i came home and had to self - motivate to do <UNK> - <UNK> ."
i <UNK> around the <UNK> site to find this urllink chart on calories burned - so apparently i 'm going pretty slow !
but i 'm getting more comfortable and hoping that will let me go faster at some point .
good i realized tonight that i 'm not really getting my heart rate up when i do the <UNK> any more .
"i could up the resistance , which i did , but i may have to start thinking about doing something different for <UNK> at the gym ."
"i suppose once it gets <UNK> , i 'll want to do my running inside on a treadmill , so maybe that will be it ."
"i 've never really been fond of the <UNK> , and exercise bikes do n't get my heart rate up enough , either ."
maybe i 'll have to play around with some settings on those to challenge myself a bit .
<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : good from the <UNK> site : <UNK> <#> - minute <UNK> walk .
then alternate <#> seconds of jogging and <#> minutes of walking for a total of <#> minutes .
so today was the first time i had to work really hard to talk myself into getting up to run .
devil <UNK> : that was just the first <#> .
<#> minutes later <UNK> : it went off again .
"<#> minutes later <UNK> : okay , this time we really have to get up ."
<UNK> : what would be so bad if i did n't ?
<UNK> : i could run thursday and saturday <UNK> : you know you wo n't do that .
<UNK> : you really know you wo n't do that .
but we 're already <#> minutes late and there 's the big meeting this morning .
<UNK> : and the meeting 's not till 10:30 !
not an excuse . and we 'll feel better if we run .
so before i went out i decided to take a <UNK> picture in my newest gear .
damn it makes me look flat - <UNK> ! ) .
"these days the changes are more subtle , so i 'm hoping i can compare photos a few months from now and at least see some difference ."
i noticed that my recovery time felt a little faster today .
"my heart rate immediately after the running <UNK> was about <#> - <#> , at the end of the walking <UNK> it was down to <#> - <#> ."
i played a little game to get through the running <UNK> - trying to guess exactly where i would end up at <#> seconds .
it 'll be an interesting <UNK> way to tell if i 'm getting any faster as i progress .
"i have to continue building strength in my shoulder , and building strength and muscle overall ."
<#> minute <UNK> <#> minutes <UNK> <#> minute <UNK> energy level : high !
"well , i decided to do it - go ahead and try week <#> of urllink couch to <UNK> ."
i was able to do the <#> second running <UNK> without much more difficulty than the <#> second <UNK> .
"i think the longer recovery time helps , too ."
i guess i just need to take this <#> week at a time and not spend too much energy <UNK> the next week .
i figure each monday i 'll try the next step .
"if it 's not making sense , i 'll repeat a week ."
i need to read up on cool running and elsewhere on breathing and <UNK> .
"i 've just been kind of going out there and doing what comes naturally , which is probably okay"
( since i have a tendency to <UNK> ) but there 's probably some minor things i need to think about .
"ah , and urllink here 's a good article ! on saturday"
i picked up a cheap watch at fred <UNK> with a <UNK> feature and a fabric band .
what a difference that made to not be <UNK> at the minute hand on my regular watch !
"or at least not on running , which ought to be the least gear - <UNK> of the new things i 'm trying !"
<#> minutes in - line skating energy level : okay this evening 's skate was not quite as energetic as yesterday 's .
"not that doug and wendy were pushing things yesterday , but with <#> people you just tend to keep moving ."
gas works park tonight and went from there to near university village .
"although i liked this route , there 's several road <UNK> with meaningful traffic , including <#> with traffic lights ."
i do n't know if i should be doing them till i 'm more comfortable with <UNK> .
"especially since they seem to come at the bottom of tiny hills , which is when i 'm least comfortable stopping ."
"i did practice <UNK> today , but still need work before i 'm comfortable stopping when i absolutely have to stop ."
"the other thing about this route is that though it goes right through the <UNK> campus , there was an <UNK> lack of <UNK> college boys ."
"i guess it is the summer break , though . :)"
i just dropped $ <#> on <UNK> lessons and gear .
"and that 's just the basic stuff : <UNK> , mask , <UNK> ( the biggest chunk of that money ) , <UNK> , and gloves ."
"i 've heard that <UNK> sound has some of the best diving around , but the cold is also <UNK> ."
the plan is to get <UNK> <UNK> before i go to new zealand in november .
"should be fun , at any rate , and it 's yet another cool new thing to try ."
"everything else i need for the class ( <UNK> , tank , <UNK> , etc . ) will be provided by the class ."
i would have <UNK> hanging off of me for <#> - <#> minutes every <#> to <#> hours while she would eat <#> to <#> <UNK> .
"this is , after all what she does while i 'm at work ."
"instead , she nurses for <#> minutes , falls asleep for <#> , nurses for <#> more minutes , plays for <#> , etc ."
"i try all the "" tricks "" to get her to quit doing this , but nothing works ."
"the only time i am a "" bottle "" is in the middle of the night ."
then she takes care of business like she should so she can spend the next hour or so laying there in mommy 's lap making cute faces .
i can not get over the change in <UNK> over the last week or so .
she 's had a major growth <UNK> - i finally got to take the <UNK> head <UNK> out of the car seat and out of the swing .
she 's getting stronger and much more alert .
she 's started growing up ... and i want her to stay little ...
i think we 're going to have blue - eyed - girl # <#> .
"i know that <#> months is way too early to know for sure , but her eyes are really <UNK> up ."
"she still looks like <UNK> did when she was <UNK> , but she 's much more dark <UNK> than <UNK> is ."
i tried to take pictures of them yesterday and today in matching outfits .
"<UNK> <UNK> there , not necessarily happily all the time , but she at least will let me snap a picture ."
she 's over this picture taking business ( and it 's driving me crazy ) .
i just want <#> picture of my girls together -- when both of them are awake and in matching clothes .
<#> of these days <UNK> 's going to get tires .
hopefully it 's before the bald front passenger - side <#> blows .
i honestly do not remember ever buying tires for a vehicle .
"granted , i have kept each of my last <#> cars less than <#> years"
but <UNK> has had his truck for around <#> years and this is set of tires # <#> .
maybe it would n't bother me so much if he could put $ <#> wal - mart tires on it !
"i guess given the choice of new tires or a <UNK> truck , i 'll gladly give in for the tires ."
<UNK> 's at grandma and papa 's tonight with my nephew .
i miss her and she 's only been gone for <#> hours .
"speaking of my nephew , he has grown up this summer !"
he has definitely gone from boy to teenager ... complete with peach <UNK> above the lip !
he 's my first baby ... and is all grown up ...
the bride seemed fine all the way through the practice .
"afterwards , though , she appeared to be nervous ."
i asked her about it and she confirmed my <UNK> .
i thought for a moment and then nodded my head .
""" you 're right , he will change ... but so will you ."
"and if you want the marriage to continue to be what it is right now , you will need to change together ."
"after the practice , i thought about my marriage of <#> years ."
"oh , how different i am now than then ."
"we 've been through a <UNK> , and it 's not over yet ."
i still love her as much as the day we were wed .
"it 's not the giddy , goose - <UNK> love i remember ."
"it 's more of a deep , glowing <UNK> love that contains the ever - present promise of passion ; waiting for a breath to stir it to flame ."
i 've come to be as comfortable with it as my own skin .
"i 'm sure it seems that way to kim occasionally , for i 'm not the most romantic guy in the world ."
"( actually , i 'm probably not in the top <#> % , a <UNK> admission ) ."
"ahh , but who knows ... maybe i 'll change ."
"when going by john 's place , he reminded me of a great book i had to read for summer classes this year ."
the name is <UNK> no more by melody <UNK> .
it was required for our <UNK> care class to alert us to the <UNK> of emotional <UNK> involved in <UNK> care .
but all of the students saw bits and pieces of themselves in the chapters .
i suppose this brings out the <UNK> nature of us humans ; we are all <UNK> on each other to some degree .
"but as the chapters flew by , i saw little bits here and there that <UNK> me up quite a bit ."
i am only responsible for my actions and no <#> else 's .
"i may try to help here and there , but ultimately , the responsibility to change belongs to that person ."
and there is nothing you can do about it . as a pastor
", my hope is to change the world in some way ."
what i realize now is that the world must want to change first .
"oh , i 'll be there offering to help ( in my little corner if it ) when it asks , but i ca n't force it ."
"it 's a hard concept for some to grasp , or at least it was for me ."
i 'm <#> of those whose identity was wrapped up in helping everyone but me .
"it feels selfish sometimes , and just a little scary only being me ."
but there is also a great freedom that comes with it .
"<#> i ca n't describe except to say , a weight has been lifted off my shoulders ."
i believe this will help me in my professional career as a pastor too .
that should be a given as the church exists in the minds of many to change the world .
"no , the church exists to witness to god and be a place of learning and <UNK> ."
"hmmm , i 'm getting off the subject a little here and i have n't quite thought this out totally ."
i 'd better sign off now and think about this .
last night i had <#> in a row that really were .
"well , it <UNK> and this dude <UNK> the officer of trying to have him killed ."
"lots of <UNK> and goo and <UNK> makes me sick , so i was n't feelin ' too good when i woke up from this dream ."
"the dude gets <UNK> and dumped in this <UNK> of bodies and there 's all this green <UNK> gross stuff , looks like <UNK> ."
"i 'm like wanting to <UNK> , these <#> guys are beating the pulp out if each other , and i wake up ."
i was staying at this really nice beach house with my hubby and a few other people .
"planning to go to sleep on the porch area , full moon ."
"i scream and start kicking like mad , meanwhile this creep - o keeps laughing and <UNK> and grabbing my feet and trying to lick them ."
my hubby comes running from in the house ( watching the boob tube ) and the foot guy <UNK> .
"i 'm freaking out , telling him that there was some crazy creep trying to eat my feet and he laughs at me ."
never laugh at me when i 'm serious and scared .
i lock the windows and check in the closet and under the bed .
i scream and this <UNK> keeps doing the same thing and my husband <UNK> me and tells me i 'm lying . again i wake up
", maybe it 's just me , but have you ever noticed luxury cars do n't seem to come with turn signals ?"
maybe they are an extra the people who buy these cars ca n't afford after spending all that money on their status symbol .
"when i <UNK> my horn because they seemed to not notice , "" yo i 'm driving here too ! "" , i get their iq ."
"i also missed a few spots , so there 's a few blonde bits here and there ."
"my hair , love or not , i do ."
"yeah , right . if i was anymore colorful or loud i 'd come with a warning ."
i need a studio where i could create all day and all night .
"i want to paint this picture that is jumping about in my gray matter yelling , paint me ! ! !"
then i can go on making jewelry and <UNK> <UNK> and finding a job ! ! !
"gop actually stands for the "" grand ol party "" ."
i 'm rich but pretending to be a good ol boy to <UNK> the common people .

that little clip is on the trailer for <UNK> showing bush at a <UNK> dinner .
"how does he even <UNK> that with his pseudo "" ah <UNK> "" <UNK> he is laying on small town america ."
"have n't seen <UNK> , i do n't think i need any more <UNK> , but this little beauty is on the trailer ."
"it 's like , i 'm a rich <UNK> dumb ass <UNK> pretending to be a <UNK> <UNK> to the religious right ."
term religious right i just think it should be spelled <UNK> .
"faith is about humility and <UNK> and presenting an alternate view of life , it implies culture and enlightenment and choice ."
"the religious <UNK> is about <UNK> their views on others , not presenting them as something to consider ."
<UNK> sick of that tired old republican <UNK> that democrats are just tax and spend .
"it 's pretty clear to me the republicans are about tax less , spend even more ..."
<UNK> when kennedy took office the grand ol party <UNK> him endlessly for being a catholic and were outraged that the president would be taking orders from the <UNK> .
now we got gop george going to rome directly to ask the <UNK> 's help in his <UNK> .
"well , it 's a huge swing state in elections ."
let 's just go see what we can do about that .
"he said he would deliver florida to his brother in the election , and i 'll be damned if he did n't make good on that promise ."
never mind all the people who 's votes you <UNK> to <UNK>
... man the grand ol party is really about the people ...
"aw <UNK> , look i 'm wearing jeans ... i'm not a rich power <UNK> ...."
"<UNK> , oops sorry , <UNK> gives me the <UNK> somethin fierce ..."
"it is pleasant to have command , observed <UNK> <UNK> , even over a flock of sheep , and that is why politicians raise their <UNK> ."
"it is , moreover , the same thing for the sheep , whatever the banner ."

"this is an optimistic but on the whole scientific statement ( ... ) """
urllink <UNK> i am happy to discover there are jeff <UNK> fans out there .
also there are <UNK> but those particular people seem to hate everything anyway .
i 've had several good my bloody valentine discussions via email since mentioning them a few days back .
"these people have discovered that even though i love them so much , i really do n't know that much about them !"
i have been making it my business to read up on them some .
well <#> people via email had plenty to say about that
"<#> reader <UNK> "" after all , its kevin <UNK> who 's the talent "" but i beg to differ on that ."
"its my understanding that <UNK> wrote most of her own shit , for <UNK> anyway , and those are some really good songs ."
"they would stand on their own even without the <UNK> "" sound "" ."
"when i first bought <UNK> , i was all pissed off ."
"i first listened to it at work on the little cd player and i listened all the way through <UNK> , just like i always do everything else ."
"but then i was all pissed off because i had even spent money on the thing , i found it to be almost <UNK> ."
so i took it out and shoved it in my desk drawer and that was that . or was it ?
so i go back to work the next day and i find myself looking forward to hearing that little <UNK> of music again .
"and me being who i am , i just go ahead and give the whole thing another run . and"
"then understanding <UNK> on me , it was like seeing the light ."
the beginning of a love affair that will never end .
<UNK> ( and <UNK> ) taught me how to listen to music in a whole different way .
"i loved digging into the different layers of sound and picking out the sounds that <UNK> most to me , then putting them all back together as a whole ."
", she 's really almost too good to be true ."
"i love kevin 's voice too , although i enjoy his more on is n't anything , he has that cute "" british boy "" accent going on ."
and the main thing i 've learned is .... it does n't matter what they 're singing .
i learned to appreciate vocals as a sound more than what is being said .
i wanted it to mean what i wanted it to mean and nothing else .
so i 've never looked up another <UNK> and do n't intend to .
"billy <UNK> wanted to be kevin <UNK> , and wanted it very badly ."
write to me and let 's fight it out .
"my bloody valentine , like jeff <UNK> , is almost too good to live ."
"but instead of dying like jeff and the others , they just never did anything else ."
i guess when you 've achieved the best there 's no where to go but down ?
"i heard that <UNK> <UNK> , the bass player , ended up driving a cab after <UNK> failed to do anything else ."
"incredible but you gotta make a living , right ?"
"saturday is the second moon of this month , called the blue moon ."
"to <UNK> , this is just as good as halloween for spells and stuff like that ."
look what i found kindergarten classes are provided for all children of kindergarten age in the <UNK> school district .
"michigan <UNK> <UNK> that before a child can <UNK> in kindergarten , he or she must be <#> ( <#> ) years old on or before december <#> ."
each spring the district <UNK> a kindergarten registration to identify and <UNK> <UNK> who will enter kindergarten in the fall .
<UNK> evening meetings are held in the spring for parents .
it greatly <UNK> the district ’s planning efforts if all kindergarten students are identified in early spring .
parents should contact the student <UNK> office or plan to attend kindergarten registration if they have a child who meets the age requirements .
<UNK> are assigned to either morning or afternoon sessions based upon <UNK> location .
"daily attendance is stressed because kindergarten is an <UNK> part of the total <UNK> program . """
* <UNK> * leslie could have started last year if she were in michigan .
we fought them in kansas to let her to no avail .
and she 's been in half a day <UNK> for <#> and a half years .
i want to go back to work and only having half a day school for her <UNK> things <UNK> .
good morning all : not much going on .
yesterday was a do nothing type of day .
on wed i did do some dishes and clean the fish tank and finish laundry .
"today is my work day , i am going to work on painting the computer room and also work on the yard if it does n't rain ."
i will be posting pictures of what the progress is on the computer room painting .
so i am really looking forward to it .
the computer however may be down for a couple days till i get the project done .
<UNK> for the best because i want this room to look good .
i really wish i knew where the desk was at my parents house i am allowed to have .
i 'd love to put that up in place of this big <UNK> desk .
guess i have to wait till they come home from vacation .
good morning all : as you can see from my <UNK> pictures i was up working all night from <#> pm till <#> am this morning .
the picture that states <#> am was when everything was off the floor and clear of banquet <UNK> .

"i 'm never alone , i 'm always with me ."
there will always be <#> <UNK> from me and most of the time they would oppose each other .

"both of me share my body and mind although both have feelings , needs , and desires of their own ."
i want to spend <#> minutes each day writing this blog .
"i do n't have any clear idea what i 'm going to write every day , but i 'm going to sit here and write what comes ."
i hope to spend much less and not much more than the <UNK> <#> minutes .
why spend <#> minutes each day writing a public journal ?
"because i want to see if i can , and if so , what the result might be ."
i have been out of the habit of writing of late .
"for a couple of years i had some external pressure to write , but since i have been in new zealand i have n't ."
i think i 'll start with the story of why i am in new zealand .
i am a person who does n't like to stay with the same occupation for a long time .
i first noticed this when i was in school .
i found university life to be a <UNK> fun challenge .
i found the discipline to study and was able to make a <#> gpa in physical chemistry .
"then i entered graduate school , and for the first year was very happy there ."
"then the fascination of school began to fade , and i was hungry for a new experience ."
"i switched from a path toward becoming a academic scientist , to becoming a science teacher ."
i spent the next <#> months getting <UNK> to teach high school science classes .
"i got a job in <UNK> the following year , working with the most dedicated teacher i have ever known ."
"steve would build the equipment , and i would write software ."
we were desperate to give the kids hands - on experiences which did n't agree with their internal model of how the world worked .
we found this to be a very effective way to get their attention .
"if a person already knows how something works , they are n't going to be convinced by simply being told that it works differently ."
"but when they actually witness something that does n't behave the way they think it should , they ask the questions , and the learning is deep and lasting ."
"but i digress - my wife , beth had by this time finished her medical school training and too a <UNK> position in iowa city ."
i got the job teaching physics and chemistry at iowa city high .
i think it was probably the best science teaching job in iowa .
"i met my teaching partner , <UNK> , the day i interviewed for the job ."
"he was very different from steve , but just as dedicated ."
we spent about a month of our own time in the summer getting equipment ready and planning how we were going to teach physics at city high .
<UNK> and i had a great time teaching together .
"while teaching in iowa city , i continued to write software to run <UNK> equipment ."
"my former teaching buddy , steve and formed a company with a couple of other friends which <UNK> some <UNK> interface equipment ."
gradually the teaching became less creative and more routine .
"the physics class was mostly in place , and we did n't need to create the experience <UNK> , we could simply revise and <UNK> ."
"i think maybe i knew that at the time , but it was n't my decision alone ."
my wife was working in the <UNK> department at iowa this whole time .
"her boss , sam , was doing <UNK> research ."
"at a <UNK> party we were talking , and i offered to write some software for him ."
this led to a part time job and the following year i worked at the school half time and wrote software the other half .
"the software job grew , and the next year i found myself doing that full time ."
"dan , <#> of the people sam was <UNK> with worked for a high powered group at iowa that studied <UNK> ."
"dan was impressed with my work , and convinced his boss to hire me to help in their image analysis <UNK> ."
soon i was learning the basics of medical <UNK> and writing <UNK> and analysis software for that group .
greg was a <UNK> who was interested in <UNK> with the group .
"he was at a <UNK> school , studying artificial intelligence programming when he had to quit school ."
"we were engaging in extreme programming , although neither of us knew it at the time ."
( i 'm actually not sure it existed at the time )
we worked on a program for analysis of brain <UNK> data .
"there are a lot of interesting stories to tell about that time , but not here and now ."
"gradually i was given more authority at the lab , and <UNK> as the leader of the lab for a couple of years ."
"i was on the author list of about <#> papers , some of which were in big journals . and after a few more years i got stale ."
"i wanted a good <#> string guitar , and discovered that martin sold a guitar in kit form ."
"i have always been real <UNK> , and pretty good at putting things together , so i took chance and ordered a martin guitar kit ."
"more <UNK> people would have done a bit of research first , but not me ."
"when the kit came i opened it to find a box full of wood and a <#> page "" instruction sheet "" ."
i found myself wanting to spend more and more time doing the instrument work and began to not be inspired by the work at the lab .
"also , i was able to spend less time programming and spent more time in meetings ."
i began to think about ways to change my job .
"then , a chance to go to new zealand fell from the sky ."
a <UNK> delivered <UNK> about a <#> year temporary job for beth in new zealand landed on her desk .
"she was ready for a break too , and we decided to go for it ."
"we both put in for leaves , but most of the people i was involved with suspected mine was of a more permanent nature ."
"we found someone to stay in our house for the year , made all of the arrangements and took off for new zealand in july of <#> ."
"beth had a job doing child <UNK> in <UNK> , and i was to spend the year not working ."
"i hoped to find a position working with an instrument maker in <UNK> , but none of the people who were making instruments wanted me ."
i asked around after we were settled and found that the person to talk to about such a <UNK> was <UNK> .
within minutes of sitting down for a coffee with <UNK> i agreed to come into his shop a few days a week and do repair work .
this work experience was <UNK> in a number of ways .
our year in new zealand was fantastic in a number of ways .
"we spent most weekends exploring the bush or beaches , and had any number of adventures ."
i started going along to an <UNK> monthly sing - along gathering at a community center in <UNK> .
"that is where i met andy , who introduced me to t the irish music scene ."
i knew i had found a <UNK> spirit in andy .
beth and i decided to save the money we would normally have spent on anniversary presents to treat ourselves to a get - away .
"the boys spent saturday night with our neighbors , and we <UNK> off toward the <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> region is east and north of <UNK> , just over the <UNK> mountain <UNK> ."
"it is a broad flat region , <UNK> from tough weather by the mountains ."
"we were the very first guests of "" the <UNK> experience "" a new <UNK> in <UNK> ."
"our room was simple , but <UNK> and it had a spa tub ."
we spent the day poking around shops and ended up doing a walking tour of <UNK> .
the <UNK> was on top of a ridge <#> steps above the beach .
"it was a fun climb , although the steps were wooden and worn ."
beth in <UNK> is unable to relax when there are projects calling .
i hope we can find more time for get <UNK> in the near future .
i want to thank everyone that has posted comments .
i have had a lot of questions about how long the surgery will last ?
how long i will be in the hospital ?
here are some answers : i have been told by someone that has had the surgery that it takes about <#> hours . in all of my excitement
"i have to be at the hospital at 6:00 on the morning of tuesday , august <#> , <#> ."
i am leaving from home on monday night and stay in a hotel in <UNK> to be close .
"anyone that knows me , knows that i am not a morning person and this is the best option ."
"my very dear , supportive , and loving friend carlos will be with me from the time i leave home until the time i return home ."
he has been going to <UNK> for doctor 's visits up to this point .
he has been in this with me from almost the very beginning giving me <UNK> to help me decide what procedure i wanted to pursue .
i feel that i am in capable hands .
with god 's help he will take care of me .
my mother will be at home with brandon and <UNK> .
"i am still not sure if i will , but knowing my very <UNK> mother , she will think of something if i do n't ."
"i just want them to know how very much i love them , and that they are my <UNK> for doing this ."
here is the hospital <UNK> : <UNK> regional medical center
1st avenue <UNK> <#> <UNK> <#> telephone : ( <#> ) <#> - <#> i am suppose to be in the hospital for <#> days .
i am hoping to be back home by friday or saturday .
i made contract with someone that had the surgery <#> years ago .
she was very helpful in answering my <UNK> .
she is going to help me as much as she can .
i ask that you all continue to pray for me and my family .
whether it is or is n't really fat is irrelevant .
i could n't get it up off the mat to save my life .
i guess eating that birthday <UNK> was n't a good idea .
"c'mon , tina , get with the program ."
"are you going to take fighting seriously , or not ?"
"it 's time to make a real change , and i mean for real , this time ."
"i think that s means i love you mom , your wonderful , and sweet"
he has his <UNK> blue eyes and light hair and oh lord his temper ... my husband used to be a red head ...
well used to be with the years his hair is now <UNK> ...
i tell him this and he rolls his beautiful eyes at me so hard i think i can hear them roll against the back of his head ...
"my husband is hands down my favorite person , he works at <UNK> and has so much patience in his job , i can admit i dont ..."
"my <UNK> wonderful man that he is puts up with so much from <UNK> much i tell myself , would i put up with me i often ask myself ..."
"no i have to answer myself , i feel i am so self centered thinking only of my happiness"
is that not the way its supposed to <UNK> ...
"he is so patient and so handsome , caring , sharing , sexy , wonderful and"
just so him ..... i thank the lord no <#> ever saw what a wonderful man he was if they had i would not have him ...
"mark , if you read this i love you my wonderful husband ... julia"
so is the internet becoming a collective brain for the entire world ?
"if i need to know something , i go to the internet ."
"of course , the weather channel changed that , kind of ."
"the same thing applies to other info like phone numbers , addresses , driving directions , news , whatever ."
the internet has provided this collective area to find all this info .
"now , think about personal computing devices and where we 're headed with them ."
i personally use a <UNK> on a daily basis .
it was a <UNK> for helping me remember stuff for work .
"my <UNK> does n't have wireless <UNK> , though ."
"so you can surf the internet anywhere , provided you can find a <UNK> hot spot ."
you can have access to this collective of information at any time .
i 'm sure personal computing devices will continue to change and adapt to our needs . with that said
sort of brings us all together does n't it ? gives more meaning to the idea that we are all part of the same whole .
which is why i compare the idea to the <UNK> .
they are many parts of a greater consciousness .
"no , i do n't expect us to all lose our <UNK> and individual thoughts ."
but it is interesting that we can all <UNK> in this <#> <UNK> .
here 's the <UNK> <UNK> of my blog .
"i 've heard of blogs for awhile now , but really have n't looked too much into what they were ."
"of course , i 'm always interested in reading other people 's random thoughts ."
so why should n't i share all the mundane crap that goes on in my life as well ?
lots to do and not enough time to do it in .
"we have <#> people out of the office , so we 're short handed ."
i work in the county clerk 's office and we 're currently looking at changing the way we archive records .
that 's worked just fine except that our <UNK> camera is as old as the hills and we are in desperate need of a new system .
"so rather than buy a new <UNK> camera , we 're going to start living in the 21st century and switch to "" <UNK> "" ."
we 'll be scanning the documents that are filed with us and <UNK> them as digital images on the computer .
i am so excited because i 'm a total computer nerd and this is right up my alley .
plus i can make you a copy of a document without getting my <UNK> up out of my chair ! :)
another benefit from going to digital <UNK> is the storage room we can <UNK> .
"right now , our office is <UNK> with huge books from the late <#> 's and early <#> 's ."
then we have many <UNK> full of <UNK> .
"if we can convert all that ( eventually ) to digital images , we 'd have more room for the new cases that are filed with us ."
"upon coming home from a nice , busy day at the office , i was greeted by an almost <UNK> road ."
"the county is working to have our road <UNK> and buddy , it needed it !"
it 's had so many <UNK> for years .
they 'd usually just come out and patch them up .
and we all know what happens to a patch job on a road .
"at any rate , we 're finally getting a brand new re - <UNK> road ."
i also received a message that a friend of mine had her <UNK> removed today .
apparently she began hurting yesterday ( on her birthday of all days ) .
she went to a hospital in a city that i know nothing about .
"i 'd like to go see her , but i 'm afraid i 'll get lost ."
"she 's supposed to get out tomorrow night , so i do n't feel so bad about not seeing her ."
i 'll check with her when she gets back .
she 's had more bad luck with health .
i 'd certainly understand if she were to get depressed .
i 'm glad she has the will power to keep going .
the walls are thin in the apartment complex that i live in .
"they 're not too bad , but sometimes i can hear my neighbor 's tv and <#> night he kept me awake until 2:00 am having a party ."
he was <UNK> to my beats on the wall .
my neighbor is relatively new ( less than <#> months ) .
he acts as if he 's the only person living in the building .
"this evening i heard the typical "" tv noise "" coming from next door again . but this time , it sounded louder than usual ."
i had to see what this guy could be watching so loudly over there .
but i quickly realized that i was n't listening to his tv .
i was listening to him <UNK> his son .
"when you live in an apartment , you kind of gather how your neighbors ' lives work just by seeing them come and go on a daily basis ."
i 've seen them coming back from the swimming pool and getting in to his truck .
his son looks about <#> or <#> years old .
as i listened to him i realized that his son was crying .
then it sounded like the guy was <UNK> his son .
"he kept asking him something , maybe he was asking his son why he was crying ."
there were some words said that i could n't quite make out .
"then i heard the boy crying pretty hard , in that sort of <UNK> that small children do when they 're upset ."
"he was crying out "" daddy "" over and over again ."
"i have no idea if the guy was hurting his child physically , but i certainly do n't approve of the verbal abuse i heard ."
"some people may not think anything of it , but i think verbal abuse ( no matter how mild ) is just as bad as physical abuse ."
i did n't like the idea that he was telling his son he was acting like a girl .
"besides , what 's so feminine about crying for god 's sake ?"
that 's was mature adults do ) when they 're upset .
"right after i heard the boy calling out "" daddy "" over and over again , my phone rang and it was my sister ."
i <UNK> on her ( lucky her ) and she gave me some <UNK> advice .
she 's a nurse and said she 's had to call child protective services on many people when she sees certain circumstances in her hospital .
i do n't know if i should call <UNK> or not .
i 'm going to wait because i have no proof that anything happened other than the child was upset .
maybe the boy was cranky and tired and they were n't getting along with each other .
does n't he realize that children look up to their parents and copy everything they do ?
i catch my nephew trying to do everything i do and everything his mom and dad does .
that 's why we have to try to be good examples for him so he hopefully wo n't develop the same bad habits that we have .
i realize i ca n't save everybody and that verbal and physical abuse go on daily .
but it makes me sick to think about it .
this guy has no business having a child .
i wo n't even go into the fact that the guy is basically a child himself .
he has friends over late on the weekends and they drink and are generally loud .
he 'll come home at 4:00 in the morning sometimes .
this was probably an unwanted pregnancy and now he feels trapped in this situation and maybe feels resentment toward the child .
"i 'm going to keep an eye and an ear out and if i have to call <UNK> , i guess i 'll have to call them ."
i just did n't want to be the <UNK> neighbor who wo n't mind his own business . but a child 's well being may depend on it .
he comes in <UNK> and gets copies of his service <UNK> .
"i do n't know what he does with all those copies , we simply indulge him ."
you can tell that he has some sort of mental condition .
perhaps he was in a war and has mental damage from having to cope with it or something like that .
"you can just tell , usually , which customers have mental <UNK> once they begin talking to you ."
we do n't treat these people any differently .
"i feel like we should treat them with as much respect as possible , but there are lines that can be crossed ."
back to the man who was asking for help with his property ...
"everyone in the office noticed he was being much more "" <UNK> "" than he usually is ."
"the girl who was helping him seemed to be trying to find what he needed , but she was n't doing exactly what he wanted ."
"after he walked out , obviously <UNK> , the girl told us what had happened ."
"well , our default answer for that question is "" you need to seek legal advice from an attorney "" ."
"the county clerk 's office is not there for legal advice and to explain what documents mean or how to go about <UNK> titles , etc ."
the county clerk 's office is essentially the library for the county .
we store things and keep records and can <UNK> what you need if you tell us what you 're looking for .
but people expect us to know all about property <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> .
"and they expect us to be able to explain all the <UNK> and outs about how they work , etc ."
we know the things that <UNK> to our office and that 's it .
"if we knew all the other extra stuff , then we 'd be freakin ' <UNK> for god 's sake ."
but you do n't see us charging people $ <#> an hour while they 're standing at our counter wanting service .
"the man did n't like the "" you need to talk to an attorney "" answer ."
he also proceeded to tell the clerk about some incident where the police came into his home .
he was mad about that and i guess wanted her to do something about that as well .
"when she could n't help him , he said "" then you 're going to get shot "" and left ."
we were on edge for the rest of the day wondering if this man was going to come back into our office with a gun .
we 've actually had another man who has a mental disorder come up to our office with a gun and was caught outside in the parking lot with it .
"( that guy had a history of threatening people , but usually with stupid idol threats . )"
our <UNK> security was on alert and we constantly had an officer within our sight .
our <UNK> are outstanding for responding to problems and i am thankful that they 're in the <UNK> with us . with
"mind you , i 'm thrilled about the panic button and as i 've stated , our <UNK> are great at responding ."
but the judges are locked away in rooms that require you to enter a code to open the door . and
i do n't want to be locked away behind some door with a push - button lock .
we 're supposed to be there for public service .
but what do we do if someone comes in with a gun ?
we 've discussed this in our office and asked each person what would they do .
"of course , you can never know exactly what your reaction will be if something like that happens ( unless you 've been trained , like law enforcement ) ."
perhaps we need to <UNK> a plan in case something like that happens .
i 've personally been in a threatening situation where a girl was attacked in my front yard at 2:00 a.m. and she came to my house for help .
i <UNK> in a completely different way than i thought i would .
i was n't thinking clearly and was scared .
i 'm not trying to <UNK> the potential threat to the judges .
i know they 're the ones who dish out the punishment to criminals and who rule against people or take people 's kids away from them .
i completely understand why they would feel threatened .
i just feel like we <UNK> are n't taken seriously .
"after all , i 'm not guaranteed to return home safely when i leave my home to go to wal - mart ."
i could be hit by a drunk driver or someone could go <UNK> in the store . after a few weeks
", the threatening incident will be pushed to the backs of our minds and we wo n't be so worried ."
"but when things like that happen , they make you stop and think about how easily we can lose the life we 've been given ."
stayed up til almost 2:00 a.m. this morning ( i never stay up that late ) .
"i went to my sister 's house and watched a movie with her , her husband and our nephew ( who was in town visiting a friend ) ."
ever woke up and felt like someone has beaten the crap out of you ?
that 's the way i 've been feeling the past couple of mornings .
i 've slept really hard and probably did n't move an inch all night long .
"but then when i wake up in the morning , i feel all <UNK> like i could probably sleep some more ."
yet i ca n't go back to sleep .
so off i go in <UNK> my body with starbucks breakfast blend .
"after getting out of bed , i decided to pay a couple of bills and get those out of the way ."
"rent 's due today , but since it 's sunday , i wo n't get it to them until tomorrow ."
"i 'm now paying all of my bills online , with the exception of <#> ."
and i no longer have to worry about whether or not our wonderful postal service will get my payments to their appropriate <UNK> .
"post office because considering the sheer amount of mail they handle daily and the low cost of mailing a letter , overall they do a great job ."
but i 've been screwed <#> too many times by the postal service to <UNK> my <UNK> .
the only bill i ca n't pay online is my car payment and that sucks .
bank <#> wo n't allow me to do online payments unless i have a checking account with them . whatever .
"after paying those <#> bills , i was a little surprised to see my checking account getting kinda low ."
i 'm not saying i 'm rich or anything because i definitely am not .
"but i like to keep a little bit of a "" <UNK> "" in my checking account , just in case ."
"not too much , just a few <#> extra dollars ."
( i was able to do this by <UNK> in my <UNK> when i quit a previous job .
"i was young , what did i know about <UNK> 's ? )"
i think i 've <UNK> a bit too much now .
it 's making me think hard about whether i really need to be paying $ <#> a month for <UNK> .
"once you get used to living with certain <UNK> , it 's hard to go back ."
you begin to feel as though you need them and ca n't live without them .
i 've forgotten what it is like to live without broadband internet or movies being mailed to me .
i 've become spoiled ( or more spoiled than what i was ) .
my name is <UNK> and i am <#> years old and mother of <#> .
"i have been in a relationship for ten years <UNK> wow ten <UNK> long time ) i am <UNK> "" short and a well <UNK> <UNK> person ."
"i love playing pool , fishing , camping , bike riding and spending time with my family ."
i love going for long drives in the country .
my favorite things are watching <UNK> in their own <UNK> and taking pictures of them .
"i enjoy cooking , <UNK> , sewing and playing on my computer as you can see ."
i like to think that i am a people person for the simple reason that i make friends easily and have many of them .
i am a very <UNK> person who will tell you the truth regardless if it hurts your feelings .
i am the baby of a large family of <#> and growing up was quite <UNK> all of this - what else is there left to say .
my sister came up to visit a few weeks ago and usually when she comes up <UNK> usually a big party .
however i was shocked at the fact that she did n't want to <UNK> in these activities .
"she lives down south and of course i live in the north - north bay , on to be exact ."
well she wanted to go fishing and walking and all that stuff that comes with living up north .
"anyway , i <UNK> her by taking her fishing as its <#> of my favorite past times ."
well let me tell <UNK> we had such a good day .
"we packed a picnic and with kids , dog and husbands - we ventured out ."
she does n't know the first thing about fishing and putting a worm on her hook was hilarious .
so i asked her why she did n't want to indulge in our usual events of partying and such .
"you guys up here , have the lakes and camping and fishing and <UNK> and all this is free . """
"you know until she mentioned this , i never realized just how lucky we are ."
i guess sometimes you just get so busy in your own little life that you tend to take things for granted .
well until that day i had taken it all for granted but my thoughts have changed .
"i love this little place i live in and she is right , we have alot to offer ."
"<UNK> is fun , fun , fun ! ! !"
"took a class tonite , it was such a wonderful experience ."
the instructor is a book artist who runs a studio from her home and teaches <UNK> throughout southern california .
"my first attempt , been wanting to create my own blog and finally the inspiration came this evening !"
"so here is the medium to communicate thoughts and interests , hope we get a chance to know each other and create a community of friendship ."

"and that 's how i grew up , with lots of aunts , uncles , cousins and siblings ."
"a community of folks who are there for each other , all of us unique , different in our own special ways ."
"we are a bunch of characters , and we are humans who continue to figure out life realizing that life is trial and error all the way ."

this song came out shortly after my dad died .
this song offered healing though in a way .
"luther <UNK> wrote it , sings it , and released it ."
"til i fell asleep then up the stairs he would carry me and i knew for sure i was loved . """
i have not found a man who could dance like him .
this first part of the song was a wonderful memory .

that was the first and last time he really really listened to what i had to say .

i told him i would see him when he got home .
i did not know it would be our home in heaven .

then an hour or so later mom called and said he went code blue .

as the <UNK> 's <UNK> into the <UNK> 's word began to spread far and wide about the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> $ club .

spend too much time at urllink the gold spike and you need to take a shower .
and it 's not just finding a good middle - class joint either .
it should n't be too big ( like urllink <UNK> 's ) .
"it must have low - limit table games , and most importantly it needs to be lucky !"

"so , do people ever get kicked outta here for being too drunk ? """
"she gave me a hard stare and <UNK> said , "" yep ."
roger suggested that maybe it was time we call it a night .
"that trip we were staying at the <UNK> downtown , and i remember that being <#> of the longest rides of my life ."
i still remember the elevator ride back up to our room .
"we both occupied opposite corners of the elevator car , and as we went up , roger slowly slid down the <UNK> wall onto the floor !"

in the next installment ... the <UNK> $ club <UNK> its ranks !
<UNK> camel and <UNK> lee <UNK> had <#> children who survived to <UNK> .

"they have history , knowledge and wisdom to share and pass down to the next generation and generations that are to come ."
"it is from these <#> that we will discover , record , and preserve our history ."
<UNK> lee camel was born in columbus mississippi to doc camel and <UNK> camel .
little is known about doc and <UNK> except that <UNK> was a full <UNK> native american .

she married a <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> at a young age and eventually gave birth to <#> children ; <#> boys and <#> girls .
"sometime after the birth of these children , her husband abandoned the family ."
it is <UNK> whether she was born with this condition or if she was somehow injured in childhood .
"whatever the case , she walked with a limp which made it very difficult for her to find employment ."
after her husband left her she began drinking .
"the unemployment , the lack of opportunity and especially the <UNK> made properly caring for her children very difficult ."
but somehow she managed to raise her children .
<UNK> accepted jesus as her lord and personal savior later in life and was eventually made a church mother of 15th street church of god in christ .

"he played with a blues band called the "" rhythm kings . """
they performed mostly for white <UNK> who would fill up clubs and restaurants to hear the music .
"they also <UNK> for the soldiers during wwii in <UNK> , mississippi ."
there is a picture of <#> of these <UNK> on file .
but the story is not a happy <#> .
maybe it was the call of the music .
maybe it was the <UNK> of <UNK> .
maybe it was the strain of living in <UNK> poverty or the pain that comes from <UNK> dreams .
"whatever the reason , <#> morning in the mid <#> 's <UNK> told his family he was going to the store ."
it would be about <#> years before any of his children would see him again .
it is known that he continued to play music and travel with the band .
what is not known is why he chose to leave and not contact his family for such a long time .
he retired and moved to boston <UNK> <UNK> in the <#> 's .
he renewed contact with his children but by that time they were all adults and most were very <UNK> of him .
"he died in the <#> 's in boston , mass ."
some of his children chose to attend his funeral .
"he is not often spoken of within the family and even to this day the conversation is still "" uncomfortable "" whenever he is discussed ."

this blog is to post any information found during my research into my family history .
""" the <#> thing i have learned from all of my research so far is that i am going to need the help of all of my relatives ."
"once i have enough information , i intend to copy it for the official family records and also to file a copy in the public library ."
i want the family history to live on and be passed on to our children and their children .
"we have lost so much , i do n't want any other generations to lose anything else ."

"( i 've built a <#> x <#> deck in back of the school i work at , built <#> new <UNK> ) ."
hopefully i 'll be going to the movies this weekend .
"the price of movie tickets is getting insane ... <#> tickets a large popcorn and a bag of <UNK> , <UNK> soda $ <#> ."
in <#> i was a high school senior with a need for a summer job .
i would tag along at disaster <UNK> and <UNK> took the <UNK> class in <#> .
"i spent the night in a gold cross ambulance , hanging out with the crew , and watching the whole thing <UNK> ."
i do n't remember how long we were there when the found the guys together under the wall .
i do remember the looks on the faces of everyone there .
"that night i slept hard and dreamed some strange <UNK> could say , i was <UNK> to become a <UNK> someday ."
i took the <UNK> class at a <UNK> south on saturdays while i finished high school .
"i was , by far , the youngest student at <#> , and oddly enough i seemed to take to the material quite easily ."
i 'm going to write about the ones who stand out in my memory .
"i truly have nothing but respect and <UNK> for these folks , it 's the other ones that make my skin crawl ."
"my first <#> months around some very different people was , at best , a struggle ."
"not because i was n't learning , but because a lot of my peers did n't ."
i have long been <UNK> blessed ) with the inability to suffer fools gladly .
the basic <UNK> <UNK> ca n't be considered rocket surgery .
"essential information about <UNK> , breathing and <UNK> , some <UNK> , <UNK> and very basic assessment is about it ."
"i finished the class and recieved my <UNK> , starting work at <UNK> ambulance in june <#> ."
"my first couple years shot by , i managed to break just about every policy regarding behavior , attendance , and attitude ."
"that year flew by , in a blur of <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , etc ."
"i was firmly <UNK> in the middle of the pack , and finished with <UNK> <UNK> in the summer of <#> ."
"now i was convinced that i had my shit together , unfortunately i was completely <UNK> for what was to follow ."
i spent the first <#> years away from <UNK> ...
"dad came through with a part time job at <UNK> as a hospital <UNK> , it was either that or <UNK> <UNK> . looking back"
"i really wish i 'd taken the <UNK> job , i love dead people , <UNK> quiet ."
now <#> or <#> things that happened at <UNK> were good .
"i met my wife there , and we 're still married and pretty happy most of the time ."
"we have <#> cool kids , who i 'm sure i 'll <UNK> about at some point , but not here ."
"since the job was part time , that meant weekends , all of them ."
"i was assigned to the float pool and basically either got <UNK> upon , or taken care of ."
i still knew a bunch of people that understood what i was capable of .
"these nice girls would send me to <UNK> , or to do <#> on ones with <UNK> patients ."
<#> on <#> is fun for about ten seconds .
you sit in a private room with a person who attempted suicide and failed horribly .
"<#> guy shot himself in the face , but they saved him anyway ."
"he lost some <UNK> brain , an eye , most of his teeth , and all of his ability to think <UNK> ."
"this was n't awful though , awful was the busy general medicine floors or <UNK> ."
in <UNK> it 's <UNK> <UNK> and carry all day long .
eventually i was offered a full time job .
"aside from poor time and attendance , i was a good <UNK> , so i got a spot on the <UNK> unit ."
"i met my wife there , that first week and we took to each other pretty quickly ."
"time passed , i worked , kept growing my hair , and pretty soon we got married ."
"bad news , though , i now had to leave the unit ."
i lasted about <#> months on the other side and i was gone .
"it was a really shitty job , and i was glad to get out ."
"now , you have to realize that my wife has the patience of a saint ."
that 's the only <UNK> for why she did n't run that first year or <#> .
i had managed to work my way into a job in a kitchen .
"i 've always loved to cook , and this was a perfect way to go <#> * <UNK> - wise ."
i rarely worked anywhere for more than <#> months .
"the work was great , but the atmosphere was not <UNK> to maintaining any sort of <UNK> ."
i 'm pretty sure i smoked enough <UNK> and drank a river of vodka than any human has a right to expect to survive .
this is just a small place holder while i get my <UNK> .
well we can dump a lot of iron into the ocean .
that will cause <UNK> to <UNK> and they remove more <UNK> from the atmosphere than all the <UNK> combined .
that and when they die they fall to the bottom of the ocean and do n't re - add their <UNK> to the atmosphere .
[ <UNK> - fix <UNK> ] this is a fantasy solution <UNK> on <UNK> and other techno - naive sites .
there are several problems with it : a rapid increase of <UNK> in the world 's <UNK> would suck more than <UNK> <UNK> out of the atmosphere .
it would also suck a tremendous amount of <UNK> from the world 's <UNK> as well .
"it 's also <UNK> to as a "" dead zone "" because the <UNK> <UNK> bloom killed everything else and then died too ."
"although the <UNK> would fall to the bottom of the ocean the <UNK> would still be added to the world 's atmosphere , but at a later date ."
"the dead <UNK> would be <UNK> by <UNK> at the bottom of the ocean , slowly , but inevitably ."
"the result of that <UNK> is the production of <UNK> , another <UNK> gas ! and <UNK> is actually a worst <UNK> gas than <UNK> <UNK> !"
"finally , iron is n't cheap and we 're not talking about a few pounds here and there ."
we 're talking about <UNK> tons of it . and
how is this iron going to be paid for ?
"gee , the techno - <UNK> wo n't like that idea ."
"face it folks , we need to reduce our levels of resource consumption , as a species ."
"<#> , <#> , attacks and authorities are not sure whether the <UNK> of the buildings has continued since then , numerous intelligence and law enforcement officials said yesterday ."
""" there is nothing right now that we 're hearing that is new , "" said <#> senior law enforcement official who was <UNK> on the alert ."
"well , first i 'd like to say that i welcome and encourage comments ."
the only rules being those that <UNK> <UNK> on me .
"no racist , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> comments ."
just keep things cool and adult and everyone should enjoy themselves .
i 'd like to <UNK> a registration system to avoid the problem of childish <UNK> stealing .
but right now it looks like <UNK> does n't support that .
"what i 'd like this blog to become is a community of people who discuss and debate issues in politics , science and life ."
"although political blogs are now the "" hot thing "" , what i 'd like to contribute is a more <UNK> look at issues ."
i 'd also like to provide a social scientist 's perspective and research on the issues of the day .
"something that i think is <UNK> lacking not only in the general press , but in the <UNK> as well ."
so join me and leave a comment or <#> .
i 'll be looking forward to everyone 's input .
i spent a lot of time today <UNK> through photo albums for pictures that i could use on my web site .
"i still <UNK> all of them , but i definitely have most of them up ."
i also <UNK> the section on my web site that kind of covers my past .
that is where most of the pics went .
"i also took the kids to go see i , robot ."
it was better than i thought it would be .
"the story was good , and it kept me guessing as to who the real bad guy was ."
"the <UNK> was impressive , and will smith was very cool ."
i have had this crazy desire for <UNK> chicken <UNK> from <UNK> 's lately .
"i have wanted <#> for a couple weeks now , so today i broke down and ordered some carry - out ."
i put enough content ( including a message board ) on my web site that i feel it is worth looking at .
i picked up a textbook for my freshman class that i am pleased with .
i even got in all of my bible study .
i need to get serious on my <UNK> pretty soon .
the kids and i had an opportunity to go out to lunch with cindy today .
too bad we do n't have more <UNK> to do so .
"how to use it : when you know perfectly well who 's responsible for a mistake , but you have no plans to seek <UNK> ."
"this line has become so <UNK> that it 's lost its true meaning , although its use as a movie title ( the usual <UNK> ) was exactly right ."
almost all of <UNK> has passed into everyday conversation .
preparing for the move requires small things as well as large .
"yesterday i touched up my hair color -- yes , everyone is shocked , shocked to learn i 'm not a natural blonde ."
so i 'm a little less blonde today than i was yesterday .
it 's <#> more step in <UNK> southern california .
"last night i spent an hour on the phone with my old friend , client and partner - in - crime tom <UNK> , author of the <UNK> garden ."
"tom and his family live in cambridge , ma , and i 'm looking forward to seeing a lot more of them once i 'm in maine ."
"the title , of course , is self - <UNK> ."
"my beloved former <UNK> , <UNK> and joseph , are coming to los angeles on august <#> to help me pack ."
i am so grateful to them i could wash their feet with my salty tears .
tears are <UNK> close a good deal of the time these days .
this is my 2nd or 3rd week working the night shift .
"i do n't know which , the days and nights are all running together and somehow i feel i 've missed out on july ."
"night shift puts a serious <UNK> in my social life , though ."
"forget meeting for lunch or stopping for a beer on the way home , etc ."
it is nice to have the bed all to myself though .
no cover sharing or fighting over how high the air <UNK> should be set .
"night shift sucks , but all in all it 's an excuse to skip exercise ."
i went to a baseball game ( just friends playing at a local field ) and a house party .
"i 'm really a non <UNK> , but lately i 've been up to about a pack a day . and all at the kitchen table !"
"the nicer my husband is to me , the more like <UNK> * i feel ."
so far august sucks pretty bad for me .
"it 's my own damn fault , i brought this <UNK> * * on myself ."
"if i have to work , i choose there ."
"i guess since my husband slept on the couch last night , it 's going to be my turn tonight ."
they say ' never say never ' but i 'm saying never .
sometimes i feel like the only person in the world .
"anyway , her and her friends dragged me outside and beat me up ."
then i went to a bar down the street and got dragged outside and beat up again .
( stupid ) then i gave a friend a ride home and ended up kissing him and my husband saw it .
what the heck is going to happen to me ?
i 'm very sore and looking for an <UNK> attorney .
"i know i deserve the whole <UNK> scandal , but i did n't do anything to get beat up over . twice ."
where has the first week of august gone ?
"in <#> short weeks i 'll be going back to class ( full time this semester ) and longing for these lazy , lazy days ."
"if fall goes as fast as summer , then i wo n't have a problem ."
<UNK> ! school ! as a person with no children
", i am <UNK> aware of all the children 's birthday parties i 'm invited to ."
"do n't get me wrong , i like the little <UNK> , but enough is enough ."
if i actually had a kid to drag to these things then i might feel differently .
"no , i do not think it 's cute when they do the crap they do ."
"no , i do n't want to look through the stack of pictures you took at the zoo ."
"i just want to drop off my gift , eat the cake , and go home ."
children 's birthday parties are the equivalent of birth control for me .
<#> to <#> screaming <UNK> on a sugar rush is just more than i can handle .
i like to stop at the bar afterward and drink <#> to my <UNK> angel .
i 'm off to toys r us to purchase another round of gift <UNK> .
what a terrible way to waste the precious little time summer has left ....
"the longer i 'm married , the more i appreciate them ."
"i used to prefer the company of guys , thinking that women were sometimes too <UNK> , but my opinion has done a complete change ."
and they have big hearts and strong minds and wonderful <UNK> tips for hair .
"they talk about women in an <UNK> way , they talk about each other , and they gossip ."
"the worst thing is that during down time , they were talking about things like the difference between concrete and <UNK> ."
"no <#> had any fun , and then the night was over ."
the only <UNK> thing was talking to my friend ron today and realizing that there was still hope .
he is just like another girl to me .
except bigger and <UNK> and a husband and father .
i have to find some new places to hang out .
it 's sunday once again and i find myself reviewing the <UNK> of the weekend .
as usual i stayed out too late and probably drank too much .
not much else to do in a small town .
"sunday is supposed to be a day to relax , but i feel <UNK> and ready to start a new week ."
must be cause i slept till almost <#> pm .
this burst of energy does not mean i 'm going to clean this pig <UNK> at all .
change of plans . staying in vancouver after all .
"my "" papa "" is heading to <UNK> as my cousin will be there and he is rarely home , as he is in the navy ."
so ... have <UNK> my trip to mid september now .
:-( have <UNK> new ways of keeping the <UNK> cool .
remembered the block of ice in front of the fan trick .
"plus have <UNK> the joy of theatre air conditioning and have seen spiderman ii , <UNK> and bourne <UNK> ( not all the supreme ) ."
expect to check out a few more this weekend .
the place smells fantastic as have several <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> 's about the place .
( had to file complaint with <UNK> ) filling up the long weekend with lots of local activities .
am planning to visit a corn <UNK> ( not <UNK> haha ) in the valley .
if i get lost in it ... can i still get some oil for the car ?
will try swimming again outdoors with <UNK> <#> this time .
friends coming over for a dinner party on saturday and then to watch fireworks .
<UNK> hates fireworks due to unfortunate incident in <UNK> .
he will bark for the first <#> minutes and then go hide in the bathroom .
he ca n't here it when the music is on .
it took me how many years to figure this out ?
have decided to spend christmas & new years in <UNK> this year with my friends and have started making plans .

my first year as an attorney has had its ups and downs .
"i guess that is to be expected , but the ups are certainly more fun than the downs ."
"of course , the first and most important up was the raise i received upon passing the bar exam ."
"i still ran to my higher ups for approval before filing anything , but over the last few months , i have actually been <UNK> business ."
i 've done quite a few <UNK> and a few <UNK> .
", i 've finally given in and bought a house of my own ."
"it 's nice to know that for once in my life , i do n't have to worry about how i 'm going to make the payments on things ."
"of course , it 's all my responsibility now too ."
"that was a little scary at first , but i guess that 's just part of being a member of the real world instead of just a student ."
"between the new responsibilities at work and the new responsibilities at home , things get a little stressful sometimes ."
"on the up side though , we 've got <#> new law <UNK> at work and i 've been given full permission to make use of them ."
oh the joys of <UNK> terror into the hearts of the young and <UNK> .
it 's my turn now to have the <UNK> <UNK> before my verbal abuse and <UNK> demands .
i learned well from the associate i worked under .
"seriously , i love my law <UNK> and i would n't dream of being mean to them ."
the worst thing i 've ever done is refer to their office as the day care center and the office manager as their <UNK> .
the title of this post is so accurate .
"i 've suddenly become booked for <UNK> , <UNK> , meetings , and so on that were not expected ."
i truly hate going into a <UNK> on an hour 's notice and not knowing a thing in the world about the case .
it does n't help that the other associate in the office is causing us great worry .
he looks like he may have a breakdown soon .
"i sincerely hope not because if he does , i wo n't be far behind ."
"school has started back , so our law <UNK> have returned to class and left us to <UNK> for ourselves ."
"they at least gave me something to smile about , not to mention that they certainly improved the view around the place ."
that also means that my kids have gone back to school also .
", i 've got <#> kids , ages <#> , <#> , <#> , and <#> ."
"boy , girl , girl , and boy ."
"the boys live with their dad during the school year and the girls live with me , so i do have a little help with them ."
"now , i 've got homework to deal with as well as getting them fed , <UNK> , and in bed before midnight ."
guitar lessons also started back for my <#> year old .
she is convinced that she 's going to be a rock star when she grows up .
"i must admit , she 's gotten pretty good at playing <UNK> <UNK> ."
she thinks she 's ready to start playing <UNK> <UNK> though .
"she 's still <UNK> if she wants to be a rock star , a lawyer , or a teacher -- or maybe all <#> ."
the older <#> wants to be a fashion designer .
"she 's a little too girly for my tastes , but hey , she is a girl after all ."
i must admit that i do n't agree with her on alot of things .
"for example , we had a debate last week over a crown ."
"she ordered a bunch of <UNK> , <UNK> , etc ."
from a <UNK> and she did not think it was appropriate for me to wear the king 's crown because i was a girl .
i do n't think i ever did convince her that the simple fact that i was female did not <UNK> me from being king if i wanted to be .
"i guess , to be technical , the definition of king does include male , but nothing says it has to be that way ."
i am doing <#> girly thing lately though .
"i do n't mean throwing something in the microwave and <UNK> it up , which is my normal routine , but really cooking ."
"you know , with the use of a stove and recipes and stuff ."
"i 'm really into baking , but even though i follow the recipe , the <UNK> i <UNK> generally end up being <UNK> than they 're supposed to be ."
otherwise you end up with a huge pan of run - together <UNK> mess that is rather <UNK> .
"of course , in that situation , you 're in luck whether your guests like cookies or cake ."
you can throw <#> on a plate and call it whatever you like .
"<#> thing that young <UNK> should realize is that your life is not going to be all big exciting trials and intense <UNK> , at least not at first ."
that was a rather accurate description of my last week and a half .
i am sick of <UNK> poor people with no money and ordering them to pay my clients .
they get me out of the office and into the court room at least .
"the <UNK> though , that is an entirely different story ."
i sat in for a day on some of the most boring <UNK> ever .
<#> of the other <UNK> was in the national guard during <UNK> and spent <#> - <#> days on the ole miss campus when james <UNK> started there .
"now , the law school at ole miss has a memorial to james <UNK> ."
times have certainly changed over the last <#> or <#> years .
i guess there is an upside to all of this though .
the morning sun rolled up as it usually does in the am .
"the alarm interrupted my restless sleeping body only to find itself shut off , no <UNK> , just off ."
why get up early with nothing of importance on the agenda ?
"when my back could no longer handle the <UNK> of the bed , i stumbled out of the room and began the morning routine ."
"i showered , brushed my teeth , got dressed , popped open a can of diet coke , grabbed a cigarette and quietly went outside ."
the morning smoking session was usually when i saw the most action at the swallow nest .
"then i froze , turned <UNK> right there in front of the door ."
"for some reason , i could n't believe it ."
maybe there was still a baby in the bottom .
"once i finally accepted that the nest was empty , i quickly , almost in a panic , <UNK> the yard for the young ones ."
"just like that , my family was gone ."
"i sat in the chair , which was <UNK> by the sun , and smoked my <UNK> breakfast ."
"it seemed as though nature was silent and still , waiting for me to catch up with what had happened ."
"finally , i started to look around , really look , for the family ."
"i spent most of the day waiting for the babies to come back home , like the first <#> who took flight the day before ."
perhaps they knew that i was n't a fan of good - <UNK> .
"at <#> point , late in the day , a baby came flying by the nest ."
"i thought it would go right in there , but an adult was close behind , poking at it and <UNK> some kind of advice ."
"during the evening walk with the dog , a very large bird flew over the top of us ."
"then it occurred to me ( almost bringing a tear and a smile ) , my <UNK> were really gone , and i missed them ."
perhaps the last of the bird lessons : missing the morning hours is not always the best choice .
"sometimes , as hard as it is , parents must urge their young to leave the nest and encourage them to not return ."
"even though you 've learned to fly , it does n't mean you ca n't <UNK> at your parents for help ."
"urllink as i <UNK> to earlier , our backyard is a very interesting if not strange place . with <#> rabbits , <#> ducks and a dog"
"believe it or not , <UNK> is the dominant animal of our backyard ."
"<UNK> , our border <UNK> , has quickly learned to stay clear of <UNK> ."
on the 4th of july there were fireworks in the little <UNK> pool <UNK> by our web <UNK> friends .
"this is when we learned that <UNK> , the <UNK> duck , is actually a male ."
"we were right about <UNK> , the <UNK> duck , being a female ."
all i can say is that it was very noisy and wet .
i can honestly say that i get more entertainment in <#> evening in our backyard than i get from an entire week of television .
"urllink ice <UNK> , utah - <#> urllink"
urllink over the past <#> years my family and i have had many opportunities to explore utah and arizona .
i am now totally obsessed with this region of the country .
"the <UNK> , <UNK> landscape is perfect for an <UNK> photographer such as myself ."
during <#> of our many trips i drove past an amazing reflecting pond as we made our way down highway <#> in southern utah .
to my family 's dismay i made a u - turn and headed back to photograph the <UNK> pond .
unexpected pleasures such as this make utah a great place to visit .
urllink during the past month our family was very lucky to find and adopt a border <UNK> .
"<UNK> came to us from scotland , via a <UNK> in montana ."
i say home environment because we have a small house with a decent sized backyard .
"the backyard was already home to <#> rabbits ( both male ) and <#> ducks ( <#> male , <#> female ) ."
i 'm sure i could post a few interesting stories about the ducks .
another important factor in choosing a breed was whether or not kyle agreed to be seen walking the dog in public .
after <#> long weeks of waiting <UNK> arrived at <UNK> on the first of july .
i just do n't get all of the hype over michael moore .
i have talked to a few people who have seen fahrenheit <#> and have accepted it as fact .
i have suggested to these people that they do a little research and come to their own conclusions .
a good start would be the <#> commission report which is free and is available on the internet .
perhaps i will purchase a ticket for another movie and instead watch fahrenheit <#> .
it 's not <UNK> and is essentially just a bunch of links to articles and <UNK> on the web .
it <UNK> left and provides liberals like me a place to go for <UNK> of of our beliefs .
"am radio and cable news is so angry , depressing , right - wing , evil and sad ."
if you 've ever heard michael savage 's show he is the absolute worst !
i know i should n't tune in because i just wind up screaming at the radio but i feel like i need to know what they are saying .
"right now on <UNK> there are letters from people commenting about the <UNK> convention coverage by the "" journalists "" and <UNK> ."
i 've been thinking about the same stuff lately .
cnn is getting to be as bad as fox news .
it 's amazing how critical they are of the speakers .
i swear if the bush <UNK> get another term i 'm going to look at canada as a possible place to live .
i guess i 'm all over the place with this post but it 's what 's going through my head today .
another thought : i watched bill <UNK> 's interview with michael moore last night on fox news .
"the interview was not live , but it was <UNK> ( except for a commercial break ) , and i must admit i was already biased against moore ."
"moore says "" bush lied about the <UNK> - there are n't any "" ."
"well , there are "" lies "" - <UNK> <UNK> of fact intended to <UNK> , and there are "" lies "" - false statements ."
"i titled my first post "" first post "" ."
i laughed so hard i almost woke the kids .
site i recommend : <UNK> the best news source for urllink hard drive prices .
"in fact , i did n't really want to leave ( and have done my best to not actually leave ..."
"cleveland is my favorite city ; i love it for it being such an <UNK> , for trying to fix her problems even though she fails so often ."
i think it is that striving to return to her former greatness that is <#> of her most attractive traits .
"cleveland could be so much more than she is , and i hope some day she will be ."
"--- while our house is finished , we 're moving into my parents home ."
after looking at something like <#> homes we found a smaller <#> that was still in construction .
it was also ( when we selected it ) at the lower end of the price spectrum of homes we were considering ( another plus ) .
it 's not at the lower end any more .
"<UNK> hard - wood floors in the dining room and living room , plus same in the girls <UNK> ."
"nicer <UNK> in office , family room , <UNK> , master bedroom , guest room ."
custom <UNK> in kitchen with commercial - grade <UNK> .
"when it is done , we 'll have room for visitors ..."
these situations have weighed heavily on the world climate .
"you may have feelings of being uncertain about the future while telling yourself , "" all will be fine in the world "" ."
these feelings can be overwhelming and often times <UNK> .
it is important to remember that the reactions you are experiencing are normal reactions to normal thoughts and emotions surrounding an <UNK> situation .
"remember , these reactions are not a sense of weakness or <UNK> ."
these are normal reactions all people will face .
the reactions you may experience include : · shock and a feeling of <UNK> may occur because of the current world events .
you may look at the war in disbelief wondering if it is a dream or if it is real .
· feelings of loss and sadness may occur after the shock and <UNK> leave .
you may <UNK> over the soldiers who have died or the loved ones who were left behind .
"the intense anger may produce conflict in your family , at your job , or with friends and loved ones ."
· anxiety may cause feelings of anger which are associated with the fear of the unknown and the uncertainty of a post war future .
anxiety and <UNK> are the result of feelings of fear and <UNK> .
these images and thoughts are often <UNK> by watching the on - going media coverage of the war and the threats of terrorism .
"if you or a loved <#> has experienced any of these feelings for more than a few weeks , you may want to <UNK> a professional for help ."
"a professional may include your primary care <UNK> , a <UNK> , a <UNK> , or even a member of the <UNK> ."
"some helpful resources <UNK> employee assistance <UNK> new <UNK> , inc ."
"<UNK> got home , shoes off , bags <UNK> wine <UNK> ( <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> yum ) couch , cats , laptop ... i 'm home.. ahh"
"what was a very frustrating week was <UNK> last night and most of us now "" get it "" ."
"tough road to get to here , but we are much further along down the theory trail than i originally thought ."
"while getting frustrated and angry was "" part of the process "" it was irritating and not the way i usually train adults ."
but this is a college course and the <UNK> need to prove that the <UNK> actually works .
"not sure what this <UNK> would do to a room full of professionals , but we shall see ."
there are going to be lots of learning theories that i am going to learn over the next year .
"this <#> , however , is not my learning style and was difficult to get through ."
the morning after the mega work project is rather mellow .
people are dragging a little ( myself included ) -
i have n't been in bed before 1:00 a.m. all week .
"we wo n't see these people until january , but we 'll be talkin ' online !"
"good week , but the most frustrating week of my professional career ."
""" what 's the rush ? if he loves you today"
"interestingly enough , the <UNK> of the kerry blog have posted his book "" our plan for america "" this afternoon , shortly after i visited ."
i have already downloaded it and plan to read it tonight .
the book is available in <UNK> <UNK> format at urllink <UNK> .
"as the election grows near , it ’s interesting to see what information is being published by both the republicans and the democrats ."
"case in point , while sitting here i just received <#> blog entries , <#> from urllink <UNK> , <#> from urllink <UNK> , and <#> from urllink"
<UNK> ( the new democrat network ) .
"they site specific text from various reports and overall , try to make their case in a well thought - out entry ."
"today ’s report ” but gives no facts , numbers , or anything from “ today ’s report ” to <UNK> their point of view ."
"basically , its just a <UNK> attack on bush ."
( urllink <UNK> ) the third entry is even more telling : “ <UNK> in florida ?
"actually , the entire entry is a quote from the article with no <UNK> commentary or analysis ."
both party ’s are preparing their legal teams in each of the “ <UNK> ” states in preparation to contest a close defeat should the grounds be available .
"what i find interesting is that the democrats , albeit not kerry ’s official website , are already laying the <UNK> to appeal their defeat in florida ."
"as an <UNK> voter , i have to admit that i am beginning to lean towards bush more and more each day ."
the information that bush ’s people put out shows what bush is doing and what effect it is having .
the first was sean <UNK> 's interview with vice president cheney .
"as an <UNK> voter , i like to listen to as many of the <UNK> as i can ."
"let 's face it , <UNK> is no more "" fair and balanced "" than the majority report ."
but he often makes some good points and i like listening to him .
his interview with cheney was very straight - forward and well thought out .
cheney came across as an intelligent leader and expressed his thoughts with clarity .
"regardless of what you think of his politics , there is no way air america is right when they claim him to be literally insane ."
next i turned my attention to my majority report archives for the week .
he talked about how his father drank all day and described the gifts that he was receiving from the republicans for his father 's statements against bush .
i know that the boy was false because they admitted it later in the show .
never again will my server capture air america radio for later listening .
any credibility <UNK> had went right out the window with her <UNK> and racist remarks .
"and yes , should sean <UNK> ever make such a reference i will cease listening to his network as well ."
"my only question is "" where is the <UNK> ?"
"blogs have <UNK> been a forum for otherwise unknown individuals and groups to post commentary , information , and in general spread ideas and opinions ."
there was a lot of enthusiasm when bloggers were accepted at the democratic national convention as journalists .
"for the most part , you can still find this ."
but the text debate that each entry sparks has <UNK> to the point of <UNK> .
"there are no constructive comments , pro or con , being left anymore it seems ."
"it ’s just message after message of garbage and insults , and no debate . and"
"” this election , if nothing else , will serve to kill the blog as a legitimate form of commentary and journalism ."
it has become a forum for nothing more than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"i have been on this kick lately , and have been caught up listening to majority report and mike <UNK> ’s new show ."
that takes up quite a bit of time so i am just now getting to the <UNK> <UNK> that my server caught this week .
just a few days ago i wrote an entry about <UNK> ’s criticism of the “
she basically said that they made that prediction so they could point to the smaller bump as a failure .
"after much searching i could not find where that was said exactly and if it was , by whom ."
so i decided to pen another <#> of my “ drop it ” rants .
<#> ) the democrat ’s post - convention bump : right after the convention polls were reporting a <#> point bump .
today they are showing that there has been no increase .
"both candidates are , for all <UNK> and purposes , tied ."
"the more everyone talks about it , the more foolish they look ."
the polls are what they are and we’re getting tired of hearing about the non - bump .
<#> ) <UNK> and dean – <UNK> keeps saying that dean “ advanced the theory ” that bush knew about <#> <UNK> .
"the problem is , <UNK> has played the footage of that conversation and that is not what dean is doing ."
"dean is commenting on all of the wild theories that are floating around , and uses bush ’s <UNK> of <#> as an example ."
"if dean is guilty of anything , it ’s giving the idea air - time ."
but bush is in a “ no win ” situation .
” so really by asking the question it comes across as though dean is the <#> playing politics .
so drop this <#> before it bites you . <#> ) national intelligence “
<UNK> ” – the liberals are all up in arms about the creation of this position . and
"yet kerry called for bush to follow all of the <#> commission ’s <UNK> , of which this is <#> ."
the unity of the democrats that was <UNK> during the convention is already starting to come apart .
my advice : drop this <#> quick and stop the <UNK> .
kerry is the newly chosen candidate for the party and it is too soon to be openly <UNK> him .
( wait until he wins and then you can argue with him all you want . )
"specifically , they said that the estimate was a <#> % increase in the polls ."
i have done a little research and i think that they may have gotten those facts wrong .
"the hosts of mr have on several occasions <UNK> the media for receiving their "" talking points "" rather than actually researching the news ."
"immediately following the democratic national convention , i was hearing that kerry was up by <#> points ."
"in light of the lack of real news that came out of the convention and the poor coverage by the networks , i think this is pretty good ."
it is certainly something that the bush camp should be worried about .
another interesting set of statistics i came across in my research has to do with the network ’s coverage .
"in <#> and <#> , the networks provided just over <#> hours of the conventions and only about <#> % of americans tuned in ."
i beleive that the networks have reduced their level of coverage as a <UNK> to market forces .
but why has the market gone in this direction ?
"everyone it seems tried to make a story out of teresa heinz telling a reporter to "" shove it . """
how come no <#> <UNK> on to the real story ?
the real story was why she told the reporter to shove it .
"minutes earlier she gave a speech where she called something "" un - american "" ."
"after the speech , the reporter asked her to clarify what she meant by that ."
"when he pressed her , she accused him of putting words in her mouth and continued the denial ."
finally she <UNK> away without answering his legitimate question .
"she returned seconds later to once again <UNK> the reporter of putting words in her mouth and ended the <UNK> by telling him to "" shove it . """
but it is her denial and subsequent reaction on which we should be focusing .
"it 's not her opinions that are in question , but rather her stability ."
the new polls out this morning show that kerry received about a <#> point bump after the convention .
"personally , i think that this has a lot to do with the limited coverage that the networks gave the democratic convention last week ."
""" they simply are not going to tune in ."
another factor in the non - bump is probably the fact that there was no news coming out of the convention .
"and although the <UNK> were very good in some cases , no <#> really revealed any details of their plans to change the country ."
"on other other hand , if bush 's camp thinks that they are going to get a huge bump from their upcoming convention , they should think again ."
urllink waking up to the sunrise . looking out the window seeing my future .
feeling all warm when i lay in my bed and dream of you .
seeing your <UNK> eyes as i stare into your soul .
smiling so much in my life . knowing i m wanted from you .
being taken to a place i never been to before .
your voice <UNK> my heart like the waters crashing into a sea .
you are the <#> you takes away my dying tears and makes me feel alive .
you <UNK> my lips with a explosion of <UNK> .
you make me want to live and walk on this earth together .
this is how love reflects me from my <UNK> .
you are my angel who has <UNK> me and took away my darkness .
"you are my desires , dreams , and future ."
"<UNK> before i go to bed , i hear your voice whisper in through the wind sleep well my love ."
"falling asleep , knowing soon we will be together ."
our love starts to stain our flesh as we become <#> sleeping . waking up to the rising sun .
urllink <UNK> addicted to the liquid that <UNK> my soul with passion .
i 'm leaving this dream for a true emotion .
wrapped in a silent cold dark night and keep loosing the track of time .
blinded by the darkest past and <UNK> by the <UNK> moon that shines upon my tears .
i have to drink from the <UNK> that burns my heart .
"feels the wind against my skin , smells the air , lies in the sand and falls asleep to the sound of the rain ."
and i always knew the answer is the same : sweet bullets .
"brought <UNK> , my cat , to the vet ."
but think i 'll wait till her jaw <UNK> before <UNK> her dental problem .
think that translate to <#> yrs in human age .
she gets rather stressed up and nervous whenever she visits the vet .
i just found out that i 'm not allowed to keep big dogs in our <UNK> <UNK> .
i wonder how firm are the authorities on the rules .
maybe i could pretend i 'm blind and need the help of a seeing - dog .
there 's going to be a full - dressed rehearsal at the national stadium tonight for the national day celebration on <#> august .
i might join a friend leon to shoot some photos of the fireworks .
"in singapore , everything must be done to ' perfection ' so we have <UNK> for almost everything ."
we even have a rehearsal <UNK> of chickens during the bird - flu scare !
i managed to sort out most of the stuffs .
tried to <UNK> the look of my blog . but was too tired .
s returned from canada after an absence of almost <#> months .
he 's really demanding when it comes to work .
i 'm almost drowning in my <UNK> and he thinks i 'm not efficient .
no point in arguing with him . looking forward to the weekend .
i have n't done ' serious ' <UNK> for a while .
but i spent more time <UNK> up the kids than <UNK> .
' cos i think i 'm putting on weight .
really envy those speed - <UNK> <UNK> pass me along the tracks at east coast park .
.... i 'm thinking of picking up tai - chi too .
actually there 's a lot of things i wanna do .
i needed to post something on this blog so i thought for a moment and that always leads to something .
at the end of my pondering i decided to touch on unions .
the union has left a sour taste in my mouth on more than <#> occasion
so i thought i would <UNK> out at it today .
"and , i have to say that i respect them for that ."
"they , and others like them , did do a lot to change the way workers are treated in this country ."
"i remember <UNK> my father and the rest of his <UNK> as heroes of some sort and , who knows , maybe they were ."
i was too young to remember now what the <UNK> lines were about .
i suppose i should explain the circumstances of this <UNK> line ( not that you care but ... ) .
"basically , a government <UNK> was building a federal prison in my community and the crew i worked on was <#> of the first on the scene ."
we arrived to find <UNK> that needed to be cut into roads .
"we began the task of <UNK> through the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> out property corners and proposed roads ."
we did this for several months with no <#> else on the job .
"then , as with any project , the <UNK> began to arrive and the roads began to appear ."
"some months later the <UNK> began to bring in other sub - <UNK> from various <UNK> ( concrete <UNK> , <UNK> , etc . ) ."
i more than earned my $ <#> per hour pay as i 'm certain the other <UNK> earned their pay as well .
"then , on <#> bright spring day , all hell broke loose on our peaceful <UNK> ."
"in addition , the sub - <UNK> hired local <UNK> ."
"unfortunately , for the <UNK> ( international <UNK> of electrical workers ) the $ <#> per hour <UNK> did not meet their union <UNK> rate ."
they wanted $ <#> per hour ( if i recall correctly ) .
the sub - <UNK> refused to cave in and the war began .
"immediately , the <UNK> began to fly along with the <UNK> that i was stealing these men 's jobs ."
i never knew there were so many $ <#> per hour <UNK> .
"the driver <UNK> the old van and , surprisingly , the <UNK> chose to get out of the road ."
we went to work and i have never been more proud of myself than i was on that spring morning .
i may have gone against my <UNK> but i would be bringing food home to a new wife and providing a roof over her head .
"to this day , i have no use for the <UNK> ."
i ca n't say this for all unions but i can say it about the <UNK> .
"if being forced to a join the union to put food on your table is what it takes then , by all means , go for it ."
i also realize that american workers sometimes need representation when confronted with certain demands and working conditions .
"basically , i feel the unions , although full of <UNK> ideas , have missed the boat ."
"our economy is driven by <UNK> , people willing to take a <UNK> and hang out a <UNK> ."
"if the employees feel they deserve more money , they have every right to approach the <UNK> and make said request ."
"if the <UNK> says no , then they have every right to seek employment elsewhere ."
"i say , shut up and accept the salary your given or do <#> of <#> things : <#> ) start your own business ."
that 's what your employer ( <UNK> ) did .
your employer took advantage of an opportunity and <UNK> it .
if you do n't want to work for him/her then do the same .
"and , i do n't mean find some government program to help you change careers ."
i mean turn off the tv and acquire the necessary skills to lift yourself beyond the situation your in .
i realize unions have been largely responsible for bringing safety to the <UNK> for american workers and i <UNK> that .
"quit whining and realize how good you 've got it now , because of those people who <UNK> the effort ."
i could go on but i 'll leave it at that .
"after all , i ca n't spend all of my time working on this blog ."
"if i did , i would probably lose my own job ."
"this blog is an attempt to convey my thoughts and , more importantly , give me a place to vent ."
"i grew up in a home where "" republican "" was a bad word ."
"i , like most folks , grew to adopt the same beliefs as my <UNK> , etc ."
"but , as i grew older , i found many of these beliefs lacking ."
this ultimately led to my <UNK> of the good ole ' southern democrat philosophy i had thrust on me as a child .
"oh , they may think they did but , in <UNK> , they achieved everything through their own hard work and determination ."
my grandmother <UNK> the party line but she also told me that it was up to me to make something of myself .
"the <UNK> was obvious , even to a child ."
"well , i learned at a young age that the first hand was a wish but the second hand was the cold hard truth ."
"a man is what he makes of himself ( or herself to be politically correct , not something i care to do most of the time ) ."
"and , the harder i work and the more i struggle , the less sympathy i have for those who do n't ."
"i grew up poor , not poor in the sense that i had to wonder where my next meal was coming from"
"but , poor in the sense that family vacations were camping and zoo trips rather than <UNK> and european vacations ."
"in other words , i grew up "" poor "" in the same sense that most americans grew up poor ."
i may not have realized it at the time but i would n't trade it for anything .
"so , i 'm blogging , sort of like jogging but without the sweat ."
"i probably wo n't change the world but , what the heck ."
"charlotte , on her trip to <UNK> , india , kept a blog called "" <UNK> express , "" which was quite fascinating ."
"obviously , this will be a bit different , nonetheless , the play - by - play of life may prove to be <UNK> reading ."
"i guess there are no true original <UNK> , and the <UNK> stores all the little facts that we believe to be forgotten for later use ."
this week when we had our weekly appointment with dr .
"<UNK> , sang was disappointed to learn that there was still no ' action ' inside her ."
"that translated means that the <UNK> , or bottom of the <UNK> has not started to <UNK> , which would indicate labor is <UNK> ."
it 's also important to note that sex can help bring on labor because of a protein in the <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> .
it was an <UNK> to only be learning about the details of birth within weeks of needing it .
"it struck me that in our culture , the details of both birth and death are kept from us until we are thrust into either extreme ."
"at first when sang a became <UNK> and her belly started to <UNK> a little , i was overcome with the feeling of taking part in a miracle ."
how could a new life that we created be growing inside of sang 's stomach ?
"this is the first post in my blog , just to introduce it ."
"<UNK> ... for some reason i do n't remember now , i decided to have a look at it again , but this turn not from windows explorer ."
"instead , i went there via <UNK> - yes , the old and good <UNK> !"
"i found out a bunch of interesting things : there 's a hidden folder , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the main <UNK> assembly <UNK> folder ."
"despite i thought i would find my <UNK> package there , i did n't , because under the <UNK> assembly <UNK>"
"instead , it only saves the last <UNK> <UNK> to its output folder ."
"however , the old version ( in the <UNK> ) keeps being <UNK> by the design - time package as well as any project loaded ."
"for convenience , i have created a <UNK> batch file that does this ( using microsoft 's urllink <UNK> tool ) : <UNK> the old version from the <UNK> ."
lists all contents in the <UNK> to ensure it 's indeed placed in there .
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> > > <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> > <UNK> find "" <UNK> "" <UNK> >"
"after that , i can <UNK> all <UNK> projects ( urllink hosts and urllink <UNK> ) ."
i think <UNK> should do that automatically every time a <UNK> package gets <UNK> ( if it 's already in the <UNK> ) .
published properties ( including events ) are not automatically loaded ( after <UNK> at <UNK> ) from <UNK> stream when hosted by an external <UNK> ( <UNK> ) .
"this seems to be a bug in the <UNK> <UNK> , because the stream reader works normally for the host application ."
i have managed to <UNK> this by getting the <UNK> class ( urllink <UNK> ) to do it by itself <UNK> to user .

"ok , came to work today , had no clue what to write today in the ole blog ."
today 's blog is going to be a top <#> countdown of guy <UNK> movies .
these are the movies that make me <UNK> like an idiot .
"so without any further waste of time , here is the list :"
"<#> . cool <UNK> ok , first off , sport movies get to guys ."
sport movies are the <UNK> romance movies where we can show our soft side and not be a total dork .
now i saw this movie for the first time about <#> years ago .
you go through it thinking its the typical <UNK> <UNK> team movie . with characters named
"coffee , <UNK> <UNK> and starring john candy how could this movie be anything but laughs ."
"this whole theory held true right to the end , and"
"my sister was there , and she is like an emotional time bomb , and when she saw me well up , well she let loose like a hurricane ."
"there we were , <UNK> like idiots for an hour ."
"<#> . <UNK> again , another <UNK> <UNK> movie . and first off , to defend myself , consider this ."
i was about <#> months from having my first child so the whole father thing was really weighing on my mind a lot .
"anyways , most people have seen the movie , low on acting , high on special effects ."
"i held myself together though , little <UNK> in the eyes , that was about it ."
"k , now <UNK> blows up at last moment , crew makes it home by the skin of their teeth , typical happy ending ."
then the asshole <UNK> or whatever comes up to grace and asks to shake the hand of the daughter of the <UNK> man he ever met .
"again , well up on the inside , i mean <UNK> , the captain hated <UNK> dad the whole time and then to do this ! ? !"
"thinking i had made it thru with out embarrassing myself i relaxed , and then it happened ."
the son of <#> of the guys who just found out who his dad was comes running up the <UNK> and gives the guy a huge hug .
<#> . big fish i have never been a huge tim <UNK> fan .
"i mean his movies are ok , and the whole way he does things so differently is cool , but it is also weird ."
"i think the major difference i found in big fish and other <UNK> movies was the story , this <#> was good ."
it was a story about a sons and a fathers <UNK> relationship and how towards the end of the fathers life they tried to understand <#> another .
"now there was the typical over the top tim <UNK> type of effects , but in the context of telling this story they had their place ."
"unlike most of his movies the effects were not the story , but instead help tell it ."
in the last <#> minutes of the movie the son had a sudden and overwhelming understanding of who his father was .
"with the way the story was told , there were many different levels of what was real and what was <UNK> and in the end it all tied together ."
"put this with both the son and father finally understanding each other , i was a pot of goo on the couch . <#> ."
"remember the <UNK> sports movie , need i say more ?"
black and white boys playing football together for the first time .
you knew you were gonna end up crying like a little girl before you went and saw the damn movie .
"the <#> tough guy boys , <#> black the other white , who hate each other in the beginning are calling each others brothers by the middle ."
the white player ends up getting hit by a car while driving after a game and is <UNK> from the waste down for the rest of his life .
"hell no , end of the movie is the guy funeral ."
"lives for <#> years in a wheelchair , gets gold in the special olympics for shot put and ends up getting killed by a drunk driver ."
maybe the guy should have took a hint and stayed away from cars entirely .
"it was horrible , what a great movie !"
where the red <UNK> grows i can not watch this movie with anyone in the room .
this is my only way that i can protect any sort of <UNK> self - esteem .
"i read this book countless times as a child , <UNK> in tears at the end every time ."
"for those of you not in the know , the story is about a boy and his <#> hunting dogs , big dan and little anne ."
"the movie is pretty old , i think made back in the late <UNK> ."
honest to god there is part of me that is ready to cry right now as i write this thinking about that damn movie .
if i watch this movie i seriously need therapy for a month .
i guess i just felt the need to let the world know what a <UNK> idiot i can be .
ryan 's <#> here and ready to get his <#> degrees after <#> years at the college of <UNK> in <UNK> south carolina .
bs mathematics and ba in chemistry <UNK> cum <UNK> .
he 's now at the university of indiana <UNK> .
he 's a 2nd year graduate student earning his phd in <UNK> <UNK> chemistry .
urllink he 's on the web here ... nice beard !
urllink pat is <#> here ( <#> now ) .
he is working his fist job making <UNK> at free bird world <UNK> in austin texas .
"the food service bug bit him and he 's now managing a kitchen at a different restaurant in austin called "" <UNK> 's "" ."
he 's a great leader and a very good cook .
"the boys , let 's see .... ryan was <#> and pat <#> in this pic ."
"i do n't know how old the duck walking by is but i think he said "" <UNK> ! "" ."
this is a picture of him in his football gear at age <#> .
we were living in goose creek south carolina here .
"urllink ryan <UNK> at a really old mac ... sorry about the pic , it 's a low <UNK> scan from an old <UNK> ."
ryan is i believe in the 5th grade here so that would make him <#> years old here .
he was born in november so he was always the youngest kid in class .
we were living in <UNK> california at this time .
my posts sound like <#> of those bad text books we had back in high school in the <#> 's .
but it is what society tells me to call it .
"i figured at age <#> with my <#> sons grown up and less expenses , i should treat myself to some of the best drums made ."
over the past <UNK> years i have played just about every brand drum out there .
this set is my dream kit form about <#> years ago .
"<UNK> is a relatively small corporation located in <UNK> california usa , very close to los angeles ."
they have been making drums for over <#> years .
"the hands on building process has created some of the finest drums made with an emphasis on the "" modern drum sound "" ."
"of course with a little <UNK> they can be made to have the "" not so modern drum sound "" ."
the kit is all <UNK> with an outer <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> .
"the finish on the drums is called "" light tobacco to candy black burst "" ."
"not only do they look beautiful , they sound beautiful as well ."
<UNK> and teaching i 'm no expert at <UNK> but i am what i would call a <UNK> .
"i have <#> grown sons , ryan and pat ."
and how different all kids are from <#> another .
my <UNK> son ryan who is now <#> years old is a second year graduate student at indiana university <UNK> .
he finished <#> <UNK> degrees in <#> years at the college of <UNK> in <UNK> south carolina .
<#> degree is in mathematics and <#> is in chemistry .
his focus now at grad school is <UNK> <UNK> chemistry .
he is also the sweetest kid you would want to know .
firm in his <UNK> and a little left leaning but very caring .
"he has always been a high <UNK> , eager to please but able to show both outer and inner strength when needed ."
nobody 's fool and complete with common sense beyond his years .
just as bright as ryan but unwilling or unable to apply this to what i would consider the <UNK> mainstream .
he finished high school then went out wandering . looking for something that i am not sure he even knows .
i know he will find his way as he proves to me at every turn .
"also nobody 's fool , he nonetheless does some foolish things ."
he reminds me so much of myself that it continually scares me .
not the <UNK> that you would feel say at a horror flick .
more like the fear you feel when you see someone you love about to be hurt by something you have no control over .
he 's now managing the kitchen at a mexican restaurant here in austin and seems suited for this .
he 's able to lead and let people know what needs to be done and when .
so through the years they were growing up i learned plenty .
i learned how important it is to have both parents in the house .
my wife carol and i never played good cop bad cop .
we <UNK> the rolls as needed and did the best we could .
now as a teacher of <UNK> i encounter all types of kids coming to me to learn .
"some are talented and do n't work at it , others have not <#> lick of ability but work and work to get things right ."
the assignments i give to my beginning students are not difficult .
unless of course you are an <UNK> <#> year old the desperately wants to learn to play drums .
drums more than any other is a <UNK> musical instrument .
both <UNK> and ultra modern at the same time .
"<UNK> a very high degree of concentration , <UNK> and practice ."
"in music the phrase "" letter a "" is the place where a tune or melody really begins ."
"i will be posting here as often as possible , which currently is the middle of most days and sometimes the middle of the night ."
i plan to make entries that are both personal and <UNK> .
some background people take up musical instruments for many different reasons .
"some for <UNK> , <UNK> , creative outlet and some even do it to make money ."
i must admit i took up the drums for none of these noble reasons . looking back it was mainly to meet girls .
"my father was a drummer , musical <UNK> and <UNK> who after <UNK> <#> children had the unpleasant <UNK> of suffering a massive heart attack at age <#> ."
we lost dad when i was just <#> years old .
"the <UNK> of his death , the <UNK> effect , continues to move <UNK> even after all these years ."
<#> effect was that i by default <UNK> his drums .
"not his talent , or at least not as much talent as he had ."
i pretty much was a <UNK> on these drums through my school years .
<UNK> with other girl seeking guys and mostly just having fun with it .
"it was n't until well after school and a few years in the navy that i actually began studying the instruments , its many demands and its many <UNK> ."
i will most likely bounce around the <UNK> of my life on these posts .
some things are so clear in my mind it was as if they happened yesterday .
some are a bit cloudy and tend to <UNK> out of me when i least expect it .
when that happens and i am at the computer i will cruise over and post .
so enjoy the ride and be sure of <#> thing .
"if i had it to do all over again , i would n't ."
urllink pat 's girlfriend <UNK> had a nasty spill on her bike while riding to the lance armstrong parade a couple days ago .
here pat 's keeping an eye on her while her <UNK> are the only thing keeping her <UNK> .
glad she made it through the wreck with no serious injuries .
all the guys in the <UNK> band know i am taking a powder and moving on to other things .
i guess they will find their way as i have to find mine .
the gig at <UNK> 's with them went fine and dandy .
"lots of nice folks there but as all <UNK> <UNK> , pay is crap ."
urllink ryan just home from the hospital in <#> .
- she seemed the best reporter on the ground of the whole lot ) .
"us americans , essentially <UNK> from all the <UNK> ( with the exception of the occasional bombing of our large buildings ) happily going on with our lives ."
so much that it is <UNK> in my opinion to focus on too much <UNK> .
"be aware of what is happening , do what you can do to make life better for friends and family and those we come in contact with daily ."
"think <UNK> , act <UNK> as they say ."
the republicans are so negative compared to the democrats in their advertising and campaign commercials .
i think this is creating a negative <UNK> and that in the long run will hurt them .
i never <UNK> the country could be so <UNK> .
most polls are showing kerry ahead in the battle ground states .
pretty impressive when you consider that a sitting president during <UNK> has never lost a general election in the short history of our country .
the <UNK> for <#> side or the other will be the debates .
in my humble opinion i believe kerry will make bush take the offensive and speak off the top of his head .
i called in sick last night to work so i cold play a gig with casey just .
his cd is just about ready to go to print .
"the art cover , pics , <UNK> notes look great . and the music is great as well ... if you dig <UNK> ."
. then <#> <UNK> this weekend with the <UNK> .
there are certain <UNK> to running your own band but the <UNK> surely <UNK> the <UNK> .
"code blue urllink <UNK> ( classic rock <UNK> , 70s , 80s , 90s , girl singer )"
now i have something to look at in case i forget what the heck i am supposed to be doing .
friday i was off ( the first friday off in <#> weeks ) and i thought that would prepare me for the rest of the <UNK> .
i feel i 'm getting better at the game as now i have to call people looking for a game instead of them calling me .
saturday was the <UNK> out on lake travis at <UNK> <UNK> .
this was <#> of those dates where i played in the same club <#> days in a row with <#> different bands .
rock at night and then jazz for the sunday brunch .
<UNK> lee ( if you know austin you know <UNK> ) showed up to check out the band .
we 'll get together for dinner some night soon and discuss the band .
"sorry guys , she 's married to the guitar <UNK> director ."
<UNK> with my brother and the new bass player went very well .
i think we found a winner for the bass chair .
urllink here 's a pretty recent family pic .
i am holding the camera as far out as i can reach .
"from left to right , pat , carol , ryan and jimmy ."
i value my family above everything else in my life .
family and music get me closer to god than anything else i do .
"i will continue posting a few more pics of various activities , fun and otherwise that i take part in ."
urllink you never know where music is going to take you .
"it 's not having what you want , it 's wanting what you have ."
i 'm playing a gig at the austin senior center tonight with <UNK> robinson .
<UNK> was the band director at austin high for over <#> years and retired a while back .
he 's in his <#> 's now but still swinging .
he 's a hell of a leader and <UNK> player .
no <#> has dropped dead at any of these i have played over the past <#> years but there 's always a first time .
my <UNK> card is out of date but i think i 'll be ready if it happens .
urllink <UNK> of blues played after us every night .
""" philadelphia "" jerry <UNK> did the opening show on the tour ."
we did a total of <#> dates in <#> weeks .
urllink as <UNK> here is my laundry <UNK> in the <UNK> sun .
urllink <UNK> has hands down the best <UNK> and <UNK> this side of nowhere .
"urllink this is somewhere in russia , not sure where ."
<UNK> the great never used it much after she had the palace put up but <UNK> leaders used it quite often .
urllink you 'll poke an eye out with that .
urllink a very famous church in red square .
"urllink <UNK> during the tour , december <#> . here"
"i am <UNK> with <UNK> , <UNK> nick and <UNK> ."
his son is grown now but that non - payment has no <UNK> of limitations .
i could never understand giving into the <UNK> needed to totally cut yourself off from your own kid .
"i 'm also an independent contract <UNK> , working the third shift monday through friday ."
i go in to work about <#> in the morning and work until about 8:30 .
"the job leaves me out on my own , a lone wolf driving with the big <UNK> and the folks moving in to texas from the north ."
i swear i see at least <#> u - haul trucks with car <UNK> pulling in to town every night .
i want to build my drum student count up to a dozen from its current <#> .
i 'll have to <UNK> on that a day or <#> before i let the boss know .
then of course they will have to find someone willing to come in at <#> to pick up the <UNK> i want to get rid of .
yes cutting back on this job is the key .
"i should start all my posts with this : "" i know this was supposed to be about <UNK> but"
"... "" this whole bush thing is <UNK> pissing me off ."
"primarily the war ( but there are other things as well , <UNK> later ) ."
i hate talking politics but i do so enjoy writing about it .
we were fortunate enough <UNK> to be ordered into live fire but as members of the military there always was that chance .
"we knew this , we were taught this and we constantly prepared for this ."
"so i take nothing away from our troops all over the world , some facing the possibility of death at any minute ."
"they are the best trained , best equipped fighting force in the world ."
"devoted , brave and worthy of our national pride and support ."
instead we ( bush ) invaded <UNK> ? ) .
let me tell you straight up that there are groups of us soldiers ready and willing to do strategic strikes on a sole target up to groups of targets .
i believe we could <UNK> and should used this <UNK> against <UNK> and his group of <UNK> .
this is just <#> example of what we could have done instead of <UNK> .
he ( we ) shipped over <#> troops to iraq .
now we watch as a dozen soldiers and many innocent civilians get blown up week after week . in case
you had n't checked lately there have been about <#> american lives lost and the number gets larger every day .
"as soon as the intelligence was found to be bad <UNK> worse than bad , we should have started pulling out of there ."
"the <UNK> often clueless president bush , who could n't <UNK> speak himself out of a paper sack , keeps <UNK> the same crap over and over again ."
hopefully he will send him back to <UNK> texas for good in november .
there 's a club out in the <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> ) right on lake travis that i play regularly with <#> different bands .
"urllink see it here last night was with the rock cover band "" the <UNK> "" ."
we were winding down and about to end the night when a <UNK> wedding reception came pouring in .
we were extended another set with extra money ( the prime <UNK> ) and kept the place hopping for another hour .
i must say that our agent loves us too .
"this place has all the <UNK> other clubs <UNK> have ... free meal , cheap drinks and friendly staff ."
my new ear <UNK> work really well in cutting the fatigue factor .
at age <#> i am finally protecting my hearing .
i for <#> know what it means to be a liberal .
"i come from an extremely conservative family . as a matter of fact , pretty much like sean <UNK> and rush kind of conservative ."
"kind of <UNK> of the <UNK> era , do n't you think ?"
i saw us go to war in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the constitution .
i saw the civil rights of a whole race of people being challenged because that 's the way it 's always been .
i heard conservatives say it was <UNK> to kill students at kent state university who were exercising their constitutional rights .
"well when you are faced with that kind of <UNK> , you either fall in line or start questioning what is right ."
i 'm a dem because i believe firmly in the power of the people to <UNK> themselves through the democratic process .
"i believe in the power of the human spirit , to become better than what we used to be , to grow , to be alive ."
"there would only be <#> party , the conservative republicans ."
things would be the same as they were over <#> <#> years ago .
the flame of freedom that burns in the hand of a woman called liberty .
she does not stand in the <UNK> to protect us from the <UNK> ... but to welcome all those who are <UNK> .
"urllink air america radio personally i think this radio station is "" fair and balanced """
why am i so hip on <UNK> republicans ?
"well , the main reason is look what bush has done to the united states ."
i will also give you a chance to voice your “ fair and balanced opinion ” .

our country is under attack and the president continues to read a children ’s book ?

"now , do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in love with the kerry - edwards ticket ."
"i 'll support them of course , but i 'm a liberal - liberal , not a conservative - liberal ."
"for more info on where all of the <#> dem primary candidates actually stand , check out urllink <UNK> ."
"i thought i was having some sort of massive panic attack . just then , a powerful force that felt as old as humanity took control of my body ."
i felt my hand move over to the remote and begin to push buttons all on it 's own .
"instead of my head spinning around and <UNK> <UNK> soup , a strange thing happened ."
"maybe some of that did n't really happen exactly that way , but i had to get your attention somehow !"
"then run , do n't crawl over to media matters for america at urllink <UNK> and join in the <UNK> network ."
bush <UNK> a <#> <#> budget <UNK> when he came into office .
"this <#> gives me more hope that "" help is on the way "" than the democratic convention ."
a little worried about the outcome of the elections ?
"but then again , if we use the same tactics to win as we did during the last election , things are going to look mighty <UNK> ..."
the fact remains that dubya 's party is still in power ... and that would look <UNK> too .

"for those of you who 've never been to <UNK> , it 's great ."
"obviously , it <UNK> on jewish issues , but has some great authors offering all sorts of opinions ."
the article reported what is being said by the media in places like egypt and iran .
"unlike most who are afraid to say it , these countries are the <#> <UNK> the people who want to kill all americans ."
"that fact that they want the president out , and are going over the top to try to accomplish that shows that the president 's <UNK> are working ."
i seem to have a lot of random thoughts floating through my brain at various times .
"and i 'm very , no make that very <UNK> , so i thought i would try putting them to paper , well , virtual paper ."
hopefully i can come up with something thought <UNK> somewhere along the line .
"i really wish the media would stop <UNK> to the men 's olympic basketball team as "" the dream team . """
"do n't get me wrong , i fully support the team , but they are n't a dream ."

"that was a dream team and could never be <UNK> , no matter how hard usa basketball tries ."
"of course , they were n't the original dream team ."

"first of all , stop calling the usa men 's basketball team the dream team ."
"there was only <#> basketball dream team , and that was the first <#> ."
"magic , larry , michael and the others , that was a dream ."
but you know who the first dream team really was ? the <#> olympic hockey <UNK> .
"if you can call any team in this olympics the "" dream team , """

"i guess for the rest of the teams , it 's not a dream ."
"on another note , today john kerry once again accused the president of using a front group to attack him and has called on the president to condemn them ."
"kerry has never , i repeat , never , <UNK> george <UNK> or <UNK> for comparing the president to <UNK> hitler ."
they even put it in an ad of their own .
"in fact , he hired the person behind the <UNK> ads to run his internet <UNK> ."
"kerry , what 's the real reason you wan the swift boat ad taken off the air ?"
sorry i have n't posted but i was away all weekend .
i am making every attempt to post <#> times a week .
"first , on the presidential election front , john kerry gave a speech to the <UNK> ."
"is he kidding , or is he really that clueless ."
the arab <UNK> have every stake in us not <UNK> .
countries like iran and <UNK> are among the worst <UNK> in the world .
their people have little if any human rights .
"these are the people who pay for , train , and support the terrorist who want to kill us ."
"fact : <UNK> the oklahoma city bombing , <#> % of terrorists act against the united states in the past <#> years have been committed by <UNK> ."
<UNK> to radical islam . and john kerry wants to be in charge of protecting us .
"how can he if he does n't even know , or acknowledge who are enemies are ."
"hey john , get a clue ! ! !"
"while i was away , governor <UNK> made his announcement ."
but a good friend of mine made a great point that i wish to share .
"the only reason the governor "" came out "" was to get ahead of a scandal ."
did i mention that he was going to work for free ?
the bottom line is this is n't a gay issue .
but the governor <UNK> the good faith of the people can not be .
"and now he refuses to step down to keep the people of nj from deciding his replacement , <UNK> security reasons ."
"hey <UNK> , do the right thing and step down now !"
"yes , that 's right , once again the state of nj is # <#> in something we do n't want to be ."
"yesterday , it was <UNK> that nj has had the highest per <UNK> tax increases in the country under jim <UNK> ."
"thanks <UNK> , i appreciate you stealing from me . and"
"because , according to the article i read in the <UNK> star <UNK> , the <UNK> has n't seen fit to cut state spending at all ."
"yep , no cuts , <UNK> , nothing ! ! ! !"
when your budget does n't add up you have <#> choices .
"<#> , generate more income or <#> , cut expenses ."
"it amazes me how nj always increases spending , especially since they have no way to generate income , other than raising taxes or <UNK> money ."
"oh , and they are n't supposed to borrow money ."
"the nj state supreme court said so , well , sort of ."
"you see , they said it 's ok this once , but the <UNK> should n't have done it and ca n't do it again ."
"in the mean time , president bush has also spent a lot of money ."
"i know he has , because it drives me crazy ."
"do n't get me wrong , i support the president whole <UNK> ."
"oh , and thanks to his <UNK> , nj 's bond rating just went down ."
i just think i 'll my money in the <UNK> where the <UNK> ca n't find it .
hi all ( if anyone is actually reading this ! ) .
but i did just watch bill <UNK> <UNK> beat the crap out of some guy from the new york times .
"the <#> thing he could have burned <UNK> on , he took from a known left wing web site ."
because what 's written on the web is totally <UNK> and checked for facts .
"hell , i 'm writing here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! which leads me to the subject of reading , as usual ."
reading is a good way to learn different things from different points of view .
"even though i consider myself a conservative , i have read books by those on the left ."
"but i have to admit that i read a lot more "" right "" books , pun intended ."
"i am currently reading "" bush country "" by john <UNK> and just finished "" the official <UNK> of the vast right - wing conspiracy . """
"both are very enjoyable , quick reads which i highly recommend ."
next i will be reading dennis <UNK> book .
"please , anything you can recommend is very appreciated ."
why do n't you call for a <UNK> in <UNK> spending and waste instead of taking more money from my pockets .
"remember , it is my money , that i worked hard to earn , that you are spending ."
all the government has done has take it from me in taxes .
you see there 's this group of vietnam veterans who 've produced a commercial stating what they feel about john kerry 's service while fighting the war .
does n't the media report all the major news in an <UNK> way ?
"right , as long as your a democrat it does ."
they were especially spending time on the artist who are performing in concert to raise money to support john kerry .
bruce spent a lot of time talking about how joe wilson discovered that the president lied about saddam trying to get materials for nuclear weapons .
"of course , now we know that wilson lied , so where 's the apology from bruce ?"
"no , no apology , only a change of partisan rhetoric that really is going to cost all of these artists in the long run ."
"most of these people have n't had a real job in the last <#> years , so what do they know about the issues that really affect us ."
"but , they have a right to speak , so i will let them ."
as i said it will only hurt them in the long run .
yesterday lawyers from john kerry 's <UNK> and the <UNK> sent a letter to television stations that basically threatened them if they ran the add from <UNK> .
he then called for the president to condemn that add .
i wonder why kerry did n't condemn george <UNK> or <UNK> when they lied ?
maybe because he only believes the speech is free when it 's supports him ?
reading is <#> of the many gifts my late mom gave me .
she did everything she could to get me to read and i just would n't do it until she gave me casino royal by ian <UNK> .
from there i read every <UNK> bond book i could get a hold of and have <UNK> out from there .
"lately , i 've gotten into political books ( suprise suprise ! ! ! ! ) and <UNK> historical fiction ."
"i 've even added a small <UNK> to hold all of the books i have on "" my pile "" to read ."
"today i want to actually talk about <#> books by <UNK> <UNK> called "" the hope "" and "" the glory . """
the books trace several families from the creation of israel through to almost the present day .
i 'm sitting here watching the <UNK> factor and bill is <UNK> the first lady .
what a difference from what we 've scene with teresa kerry .
bush comes off as a very educated and <UNK> person .
i have a lot of respect for her and the things that she has accomplished .
"i think i would love to sit and talk with her as much as i would like to sit with her husband , president bush ."
"i have to admit , some of the things she has said has made me laugh , but"
"whenever i here her speak , i feel like i 'm at the local pub ."
"her supporters would just say that i do n't like strong women . if that was true , i would n't like mrs ."
"unfortunately , i get the feeling from mrs ."
and it 's that 's arrogance from both mrs and mr heinz ( i mean kerry ) that 's going to return the president to the white house !
"dear <UNK> , i sat watching last week 's democratic convention and had to laugh , because i thought i heard republicans talking with just a few exceptions ."
where were the real al gore and ted kennedy ?
their speeches were far different than the rants and <UNK> that they have been giving in speeches prior to the convention .
"john edwards gave an excellent speech , but it was filled with class warfare rhetoric that is not helpful to the countries future ."
"finally , john kerry spoke , and he also gave an excellent speech full of great <UNK> ."
and that 's the problem ; all i really know about john kerry is that he hates president bush and that he wants to raise taxes .
"he says he has plans , but wo n't tell us what they are ."
"whenever you question his voting record in the senate , he says you are questioning his patriotism ."
( thank you to john <UNK> for his editing skills ! )
please understand that the author assume no responsibility for any emotional trauma caused by reading this je .
the author further claims no <UNK> of the idea or contents .
some define good life as having lots of money and possessions .
i am a firm believer of love ; i believe that the purpose of life should be learning how to love .
there are several stages of love in which love <UNK> .
i believe all human love is self - love .
"now hold on , don’t stop reading because i said something that we all know but don’t want to admit simply because we don’t want to be called selfish ."
"it ’s not selfish , it ’s the reality but we don’t see it because we are afraid of being labeled as selfish ."
i will explain you according to my knowledge and understanding and then you be the judge and decide if i have any grain of truth in it .
"this is the knowledge i have from my experiences , learning , reading , and listening to <UNK> speakers ."
"this includes psychology , philosophy , and personal experiences ."
we go through stages in which we <UNK> our sense of <UNK> ; once we pass these stages we expand our sense of <UNK> .
"since <UNK> have history of all those great <UNK> who <UNK> love , and meaning of life thus i will use greek letters to represent these stages ."
you might find some of these characteristics in your personality but please don’t label yourself without going through all this reading .
every <#> of us <UNK> combination of characteristics in personality .
"don’t get ahead yourself , please bare with me ."
these are the <UNK> from which we view our lives .
i am going to refer women perspective as an example you are free to substitute your gender .
she <UNK> her <UNK> to her search for security .
"she feels secure <UNK> herself with other people , especially family of some type ."
her claim of love for her family is strictly her need of security .
family <UNK> her needs thus she claims that she loves them .
finally she does not question the belief system of the person or group she has attached herself .
when we are born as an infant and as a child we feel helpless insecure .
"we realize that we are <UNK> , weak , and small person in the world of these huge and strong adults ."
we are vulnerable and to protect ourselves we <UNK> ourselves to our families .
our families provide all our physical and emotional needs and <UNK> us from harm .
this is our security blanket and as a part of this security blanket there are religious and social beliefs that we accept mainly without questioning them .
since we do not know any better at this age and have no control over events so we follow our adults .
"now she is in her husband house , who is in many respects is another <UNK> just like she had before ( her father ) ."
just like her father now her husband takes care of her protect her provide all her security needs .
"he gives her all his religious , political , and social beliefs in return of this security blanket ."
"he even gives her name , his last name just like her parents gave her ."
"she changed nuclear family units , but she remained an alpha personality ."
<UNK> men in some respect are alpha persons too .
i’m just giving example of those who demonstrate these traits .
guys too are motivated by a need for security .
they too move directly from their parent ’s house to the house with their wives .
she now fulfill many of the functions his mother use to fulfill .
"she <UNK> , clean , arrange his social life , and purchase his clothes for him ."
he continues to follow the value system given by his parents .
some of the alpha personalities <UNK> themselves to an organization instead of a person or nuclear family .
"religious organizations , political groups , social organizations such as <UNK> and <UNK> are especially attractive to them ."
"these organizations give their members a system with values , a sense of belonging , and an identity ."
"the use of words like "" brother "" and "" sister "" by these organizations shows their attempt to replace the original family unit their members have left ."
"alpha person tends to associate herself closely with other people , she claims that she loves them but her love is self - love ."
the motivation behind this love is the security need .
"alpha personality can also be <UNK> by the phrase "" i need ."
""" many alpha people refuse to admit the motivation behind their behavior ."
we can only see this clearly if we were to concentrate on our emotions .
the human mind is capable of lying to itself but the emotions never lie .
"for an alpha person to be happy , she has to only associate herself a person or group and assume the values of that person ."
"my first love is my mother , she happens to be an alpha person ."
my father fulfilled her security needs and she fulfilled his security needs .
"when my father died , she got real sick her entire world turned upside down , she felt insecure again ."
nothing in the world could make her feel secure until she found a religious organization .
the organization gave her sense of security all over again .
"this organization gave her extensive system of values , a sense of belonging , and an identity , which she felt she has lost after my father ’s death ."
i identified myself with alpha personality while i was child .
at the age of ten i knew that i’m not an alpha person .
"i didn’t want to associate myself with any organization , team , or any social group ."
my mother <UNK> me to an independent boy scout organization supported by the company my father worked in .
she tried to force the system of values she had .
i liked this organization since it gave me time away from my family and with variety of different kids .
i enjoyed the travel part of being in that organization .
my motivation was purely to meet new people and go around the world .
"as much as my parents were protective about me , i shouldn’t be the way i’m now ."
"more i stayed away from home , more my self hood gained strength ."
i will relate myself to the personalities i feel associated with later in these journals .
the advantages of alpha personality include the fact that happiness is rather easy to achieve .
for an alpha person to be happy they only have to associate themselves with a person or group and assume the values of that person or group .
"second advantage of being alpha person is the fact that majority of the world ’s population are alpha people , it ’s easy to fit with most groups ."
<UNK> would be the attitude to accept the belief system without questioning .
"we do not purely exist in any <#> of these stages , in fact we some time exist in several ."
there is always <#> <UNK> perspective from which we view reality .
why do we need to identify this <UNK> stage ?
simply for the reason of our growth to higher stages .
we need to know where we came from and where we are at present in order to plan for our future growth .
the essential need for this growth from <#> stage to another is humility .
"if we have the humility to admit that we exist at <#> of the lower stages of development , progress to the higher stage is possible ."
if we <UNK> make ourselves believe that we already exist at higher stage then <#> things could happen .
i will add our religion to the context of this theory .
we as muslims <UNK> ourselves in the presence of allah in every prayer by <UNK> down .
"we put our forehead , noses to ground showing our <UNK> to the greatest power of universe ."
the growth begins from our <UNK> in our prayers .
"the more humble we get in our prayer , more development we feel ."
the great muslim <UNK> and saint were the most humble people on the earth .
"each stage brings a certain type of pain with it , which drive us to a higher stage ."
nature has its own timing and order for such things .
"if <#> never feel this discomfort and spend his/her entire lifetime , i believe there is nothing wrong with that ."
"part ii -- beta perspective ( i want ) at the age of <#> , i began to wonder about my life ."
"i realized that everything that i had , and every thing i was , was given to me by other people ."
my father provided me financial security till he died .
i came to believe that i achieved a little or nothing on my own .
i became overwhelmed by a sense of shame concerning lack of personal <UNK> .
this was the time when i entered in <UNK> stage of beta perspective .
i felt the absence of something in my personality .
i began to believe that a sense of personal achievement is an inherent human need .
"these feelings , combined with the feelings of moving on beyond my concerns with security entered me in to the beta perspective . in my early stage of beta personality"
", i felt the need to rebel against the sources of the security i have experienced as alpha person ."
"i experienced great deal of anger , i left the security of marriage , did everything which was forbidden ."
i was involved in marathon sex after my divorce .
soon enough i realized no need to <UNK> rebel .
"the feelings of shame took over me and motivated by a sense of shame , i decided to finish my education on my own ."
i held <#> jobs and finished school with those jobs .
i was finished with my bachelor and started working for a university system by year <#> .
this is my second stage of beta personality where i am trying to achieve things on my own with all the responsibilities involved .
"i have almost <#> jobs , taking care of my kids , going to school , and work full time ."
"my desire for personal <UNK> keeps me going , i experience a sense of pride for my <UNK> ."
pride is the dominant emotion of the fulfilled beta personality .
"beta people are driven to excel , their <UNK> might rest in any field ."
the <UNK> of beta perspective consists in the compulsive nature of the need to excel .
beta person can not be happy unless he is constantly achieving something .
the degree of his achievement is judged by other people .
"therefore , what he is really seeking is recognition from others ."
"he chooses his identity , although his <UNK> of the success of this identity is dependent upon others approval ."
society and beta perspective : society has <UNK> reserved the beta life style of <UNK> achievement for men only .
women have <UNK> been conditioned into accepting the alpha role of wife and <UNK> .
i believe that women are better candidates to accept the <UNK> of a beta life style than are men .
medical evidence indicates that women are better equipped than men to endure stress .
thus they are more qualified to join in the competitive life of the beta person .
"the central problem facing <UNK> is the problem of an identity crisis , a feeling that they are nothing but <UNK> of their husbands and children ."
it gives their lives a sense of meaning and purpose .
i associate myself with mercury simply because it 's the only metal which is found in the liquid form .
i have to come out of closet and admit against the popular belief that being a man i 'm loving and <UNK> .
do you understand now what i am talking about ?
it rises on a hot contact in a glass tube .
once i’m out of the tube no <#> can hold me .
"i will spread like mercury in tiny pieces , every piece of mine will be complete in shape but it wouldn’t be the same ."
would anyone care to find those pieces and put me into shape i was ?
"every time i’m dropped i changed my shape , i collected myself together like mercury but some pieces of mine are lost , i can’t be the same ."
can some <#> stop this <UNK> some <#> cool it <UNK> some <#> make sure i stay in tube ?
may be this time if i’m dropped i may or may not stay the same shape .
"i’m the mercury and i don’t <UNK> shapes , but my container has to be my size or bigger ."
not too big that i disappear and not too small that i spill over and lose some parts of me .
it neither let me spill <UNK> let me disappear .
"i’m done for today , i have expressed myself , now i’m back to the battle of temperature ..."
so ! this is my on - line journal .
let me know if it is ( or is n't ) as it will be <UNK> to hear from you .
the world of preparation can be a painful <#> .
after i had had my <UNK> i went to starbucks for a <UNK> and a bit of a sit down .
"my tea was delivered to me , as was my <UNK> muffin , and i took a <UNK> sip . '"
i <UNK> to the young lady who served me . '
planning a trip is really an excuse to go shopping for all sorts of toys .
i have just been surfing around looking for the ultimate travel pack .
"most importantly that it does have lots of pockets , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
not to mention a handy little hook to hang your keys on .
hopefully this journey will result in me finding something that i can bond with and that will allow me to pack far too much stuff into .
it would n't be right if there <UNK> several items that i <UNK> around the globe that did n't see the light of day from <UNK> to <UNK> .
"book of the day - join me , by danny <UNK> ."
"my <UNK> route is from <UNK> to <UNK> , singapore , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , la and then back to <UNK> old london ."
"i have no plans to do any extreme <UNK> , <UNK> !"
"got to go and get my <UNK> sorted out now , so take care and i will post another update if anything else happens ."
once upon a time i had <UNK> on the topic of the initial <UNK> period .
"i said you can’t believe who a person is , or rather presents , during the first <#> months ."
"sure , we fall in love , but in the end is it the real person we’re falling in love with or is it the illusion that person created ?"
i admittedly placed an ad in the mega online dating service .
"the way i <UNK> my profile i thought i’d get ... well , i don’t know who i’d get ."
why do i think he ’s going to break up with me at any moment ?
i get nervous and paranoid if he hasn’t emailed me by a certain time .
"yes , of course he has work he needs to do ."
it ’s fantastic knowing there are other people in his life that he needs <UNK> to .
"perhaps the reason for our need for perfection is if we feel perfect , <UNK> , we will be <UNK> <UNK> ."
if we are less than perfect how can we be loved ?
"we find it so easy to love and forgive our friends when they are painfully , <UNK> and beautifully flawed ."
maybe it ’s from being scared of needing someone .
"i gave all those things up , including the big girl , when i left my marriage ."
i should be able to do it on my own .
"they don’t play double mint gum commercials anymore , where pleasure and fun were <UNK> when in pairs ."
how do i tell him he feels like home when he holds me ?
there ’s so much that new love <UNK> up .
the <#> people in question become mirrors to each other .
in the beginning you can see what that other person sees in you : that perfect creature you’ve always wanted to be and sometimes convince yourself you are .
the problem is maintaining perfection is an <UNK> illusion .
"“ we were young and stupid ” , we <UNK> <UNK> over a <UNK> cocktail ... or <#> ."
"we <UNK> ourselves , <UNK> process for product where the final end result had better be fucking good and we’d better have something <UNK> to show for it ."
we know they’re going to be there at the end of the day .
we say we hate it when we’re in a relationship where <#> day <UNK> itself over and over again .
"<#> ’s life <UNK> to nothing more than edited <UNK> , eventually understanding fully how there is no greater loneliness than the lonely felt while being with a partner ."
so we move on ( give up ? ) when the going gets boring and there ’s no sign of hope or light .
"we resolve to take this new knowledge , the stuff we don’t want , into the next relationship . but where does that leave us ?"
being a bunch of spoiled kids with <UNK> attention <UNK> never fully understanding the sacrifice and potential <UNK> of total commitment ? or in search of true love ?
what i do know is when i look at the new <#> it ’s absolutely <UNK> .
i don’t really think the odds are against me .
i just never realised how chicken i can be .
the way i’ve been living my life up until now .
"i feel like a death - <UNK> tight - rope walker with no <UNK> rod , just an empty , <UNK> pit below me ."
thankfully i 've worked out what i 'm wearing .
i got t - shirts made with iron - on <UNK> in the front <UNK> the day .
"well , not really the day , but just a nickname death calls mike ."
my print <UNK> thought the spelling was off ; it suggested a <UNK> ball .
i kept the actual design to a cute little line drawing .
"we all have our pet names on the back , with our special numbers we 're particularly attached to ."
death 's is death <#> and <UNK> 's is <UNK> <#> .
i was so delighted when the t - shirt guy applied all the letters and numbers .
it 's better than seeing yourself on television !
suddenly i find myself feeling a little better about circumstances .
i think this party will be just as important for me as it will be for <UNK> . and
i was writing in my journal this morning about my last night .
last night i felt a- l - o - n - e .
i was in such a <UNK> state last night i ended up <UNK> david .
like i have n't put myself on the line enough lately .
i think i just felt at the end of my <UNK> emotionally .
like i have n't been <UNK> enough recently .
what i do n't like is being lonely . being single and alone is a hell of a lot better than being with someone and alone .
"so i 'll take it , if there is a choice ."
why is n't a wonderful body of friends not enough sometimes ?
"well , you ca n't get too physically close to friends ."
"not sex , per se , just the <UNK> felt when <#> people who care so much about each other are together and beauty is created ."
i think it was the same feeling i had when i watched that <#> episode on attention deficit disorder .
the thing is i think what so many people are going through is utter bullshit .
"they do n't want the titles "" girlfriend "" or "" boyfriend "" ."
my friend dirty was supposed to go on a buying trip with her current boss down in nyc .
the night before she 'd run into me quite by accident .
"we decided to go down the street and visit mutual friends that worked at a <UNK> restaurant , after closing hours ."
"normally , and i have worked as a bartender for many years , this drink contains , at most <#> <UNK> of liquor ."
"ian did n't measure , but by internal counts he 'd put in approximately <UNK> of vodka ."
ian also did n't know she had n't eaten anything that day .
"she 'd also ordered a shot of tequila , something i 'd never seen her do in all the years of knowing her ."
"she did n't want to go to new york with wendy , her boss ."
"she still went , <UNK> <UNK> , still sick , and had a horrible time ."
he does n't listen to the women he has sex with if they talk about themselves and try to <UNK> themselves to him .
"he says he does n't want the <UNK> of the next morning , or mornings to come ."
""" he later <UNK> his tactics are a lonely road ."
"i do n't want "" him "" to be my everything ."
i 've got a lot going on with my friends and the life i really love right now .
i want to be <UNK> and loved in the same way i give it out .
"well , not exactly the same , otherwise i 'd know exactly how it 's to come and it would no longer be so <UNK> ."
"you know it 's coming , so it 's not <UNK> ."
my eyes would almost <UNK> over and i felt ... nothing .
"these <UNK> were in place so we did n't have to hurt as much or , in reality , feel as much ."
i told him i do n't operate that way .
we try so hard in so many areas of our lives of pretending so many parts .
"we pretend we 're happier than we are , more together , maybe a little richer , more successful ."
but really it 's something other than what we 're really feeling .
my mother had called a few days ago asking if i 'd accompany her to <UNK> to do a <UNK> mission to see if my <UNK> brother was alright .
i told her i would n't go and i did n't think it was a good idea for her to go .
she thought otherwise and accused me of being less than compassionate .
i told her that everyone has his own time to figure things out .
"sometimes it 's harder to figure when there 's someone over your shoulder questioning , wanting , wishing for more ; answers , reasons ."
people need to come to their own conclusions in their own time .
all we can do is support them in their time of needing space to make those decisions .
"sometimes , in our infinite wisdom ( she <UNK> with a great deal of irony )"
this is a lesson that took me <#> years to figure out .
"i told her i did very much the same as my brother , walter , in terms of <UNK> myself from the family at times ."
i stopped going to certain family functions just because they were n't fun .
"everyone was trying to convince everyone else of his or her own personal success , whatever that meant to the individual ."
"for me it meant <UNK> far more happiness than i actually felt , <UNK> a happier marriage than i really had ."
<UNK> have a paid responsibility to make the masses laugh .
"first in italian , well ... just ... because ! <UNK> !"
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> non so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> !
"e se <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ,"
"<UNK> in <UNK> lo <UNK> ed il <UNK> , in una <UNK> il <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> - ah !"
<UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> il <UNK> . and
"in english , for us <UNK> sad and loving creatures of beauty and <UNK> : to perform ! ..."
put on your costume to perform ! in the <UNK> of <UNK>
"i do n't know anymore what i 'm saying , what i 'm doing !"
"put on your costume , and make up your face ."
"people are paying , they want to laugh . and when <UNK> takes away your <UNK> , laugh , you clown , and everyone will cheer !"
"turn your agony and your tears into <UNK> , your sobbing and pain into a funny <UNK> - ah !"
"laugh , you clown , at your broken love ."
there is <#> thing in this world i will never <UNK> : the consistent <UNK> behaviour of some people .
"<#> who is <UNK> late , and usually coupled with being <UNK> ."
"well , much of my <UNK> consists of these such people ."
you try to call him and the phone does n't answer .
eventually i did end up going to said cottage and having a wonderful time with him and other friends .
"he has this <UNK> , not unlike <UNK> <UNK> 's , from the movie <UNK> ."
and it 's irritating both at the same time .
"for example we 'd made <UNK> , <UNK> plans to see a baseball game ."
we 'd been chatting throughout the week via email .
then at <#> point i 'd asked him how his friday was looking .
he said he had these tickets to go see a baseball game .
"he 's really bright , but there are moments that i think , "" jesus , he ca n't be that stupid . """
"so , i 'm now the stupid <#> because * again * i 've made plans with him and he 's completely <UNK> out again ."
and he 's not a totally <UNK> jerk - wad .
"he was out with a female <UNK> co - worker and she had just told him the most <UNK> , horrific tale of her <UNK> <UNK> ."
it turned out that he 'd also received a package from his lawyer <UNK> his divorce <UNK> .
so he and his friend had much to <UNK> .
"when he did call he sounded totally <UNK> up , mostly from the tale told to him by this young woman ."
"i 'll never know this story , which is just fine ."
if we ca n't understand and then forgive our friends their <UNK> and <UNK> then what kind of friend would we be ?
"men are alright , but guys and boys are righteous !"
case in point : i 'd just gone to the <UNK> festival to see <UNK> ( wicked ) and <UNK> ( ruled ) .
"i met up with mike , pete and <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , i 'd pointed out , had the best name i 'd heard all day . probably all month , if not all of this year ."
"when guys meet other guys , in certain circumstances , it 's very <UNK> of being kids ."
"when we 're kids we see another kid , approach them simply because we 're the same height and at the same eye level ."
<#> kid will invite the other kid to play .
sometimes there 's an exchange of names right from the start .
"sometimes the names are n't brought into the fold until the end , when someone 's mom calls him in for dinner ."
"i knew mike , a cook , from a local watering hole ."
"he brought pete , a best mate of jimmy 's , <#> of the <UNK> at said watering hole ."
"both pete and jimmy are from england , england ."
"no <#> knew <UNK> , but he had a wonderful sense of humour and play ."
"he was terribly enthusiastic about everything , which was refreshing ."
"instead of using balls , or <UNK> or gloves or other props , we played with <UNK> ."
"it was <UNK> , harsh , sweet , <UNK> , incredibly funny and sometimes <UNK> with delicious <UNK> ."
: you must make a <UNK> comment about something on them .
"it could be a piece of <UNK> , their hair ( they usually love this ) , eyes , shoes ( also a favourite ) , <UNK> , etc ."
"this is designed not only as an <UNK> , but it also shows the other girl is not a threat ."
you do n't have to do this with guys .
<UNK> rule number <#> : you have to talk about your feelings .
this may be <#> of the interests the girl has right now .
"guys do this too , but they work it into the conversation more naturally but they certainly do n't dwell on it forever ."
girls try to figure out a solution to the problem .
"guys just say , "" dude , that sucks , "" and move on ."
"music , science fiction , books , pictures ( both moving and still ) , hobbies and interests ."
they 're always keeping <UNK> of stuff almost in anticipation of sharing these little <UNK> of what most women consider useless information .
"if i 'm not in the mood for a certain topic , i 'll just tune out ."
guys are just happy to be my friend without expecting anything in return .
". all earth experiences are like the <UNK> used on the slides of a <UNK> to make you conscious of invisible things . """
with folded wings i 'd watched american beauty before but did n't truly understand the plastic bag sequence until this past week .
the final <UNK> spoken by kevin <UNK> 's character <UNK> up what i 'd felt on that magic subway ride .
""" i 'd always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die ."

"it stretches on forever , like an ocean of time ."
and the first time i saw my cousin tony 's brand new <UNK> .
i guess i could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me .
but it 's hard to stay mad when there 's so much beauty in the world .
"sometimes i feel like i 'm seeing it all at once , and it 's too much ."
my heart fills up like a balloon that 's about to burst .
"you have no idea what i 'm talking about , i 'm sure . but do n't worry : you will someday . """
"i 've been allowing only grace , goodness and love enter in and out of my body for the last several days ."

i am trying to live fully in the present .

i 've been having these wonderfully <UNK> moments lately .
i 'll have questions in my head concerning the ways i 've <UNK> in the past or just qualities about myself that i was n't sure about .
i 'll happen upon things that help me in my search for self understanding .
sometimes just plain wonderful things happen if i pay attention .
i had decided yesterday that it was going to be my own fun day .
i was going through the <UNK> site for general event <UNK> .
"the idea of going to see live theatre sent a <UNK> of utter <UNK> through me , mostly because i 'd been an actor ."
but bands ... interesting ... i could see a live band .
so i 'm <UNK> down and i notice playing at lee 's is the <UNK> .
"my 11:00 , black , <UNK> , head held between <#> hands , either chanting a prayer or crying to herself . not softly . to"
looking back at my 11:00 the older woman had released her head to show me the full <UNK> in her right eye .
"it was ice blue , <UNK> , determined , like a steel <UNK> ."
to my 9:00 there was an empty paper take - out coffee cup rolling in an <UNK> along the floor .
"to my 3:00 there was a polish looking <UNK> , in his <#> 's carrying a wrapped gift bag ."
he was <UNK> <UNK> the tissue paper <UNK> it .
"there was a woman in her late <#> 's in a cheap track outfit , cheap sandals , <#> <UNK> leg crossed over the other ."
"there was a young man , <UNK> , would be seriously hot , to me , if he shaved and got a haircut ."
with the <UNK> and the hair he seemed to be going for that jesus look .
i met eyes with him for maybe <#> seconds .
he spent the entire ride looking at my reflection through the window next to him .
all of these images are so incredibly dear and beautiful to me .
"and they happen all the time to everyone , but nobody really sees them ."
"the <UNK> are from washington , d.c . a <#> piece outfit , solid band ."
<UNK> he has a chris martin ( <UNK> ) look about him .
"tall , lightly <UNK> , <UNK> suit jacket , casual underneath , sings with all his might ."
"he 's not really saying anything as much as he 's screaming a lot , hyper - developing his massive <UNK> vein ."
he comes from the bob dylan meets <UNK> school of vocal <UNK> .
"when he walked on stage the mike , which was previously set to "" shoe - <UNK> "" standards , was switched to <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> heights ."
this meant <UNK> high into the mike while looking down at his audience .
he looked at us with both fear and <UNK> at the same time .
"his band was so good , but his singing style does n't allow me to play the album as much as i 'd like ."
"his lyrics are alright , but this protective stance of screaming what it is that needs to be said , leaves me a bit cold and a bit frightened ."
"still , i lost my mind during the rat ."
"i like when opening acts <UNK> us , the audience ."
it 's happened quite a few times in my life .
they have a <UNK> new new order sound about them .
"guitar and rhythm section <UNK> rich and satisfying , not unlike <UNK> ; vocals merely a layer , <UNK> , not <UNK> , not <UNK> , actually <UNK> ."
"watching these <#> bands , wonderful each in their own ways , reminded me of a story on the <UNK> 's definitely not the opera ."
it 's more a questioning and from a <UNK> perspective .
"with americans they tend to state their "" fact """
"and it 's stated <UNK> , <UNK> and not open for discussion ."
i was telling jeremy about this and he asked if i was american .
"i used to hate it , complaining about the * other * people ."
secretly i 'd once wished the bands i loved would just do a special show just for me .
eventually i <UNK> my concert - going brothers and sisters mostly because it took the pressure off maintaining my enthusiasm for the band .
"now i can allow the music to fully <UNK> me , make my <UNK> , chest , and <UNK> legs <UNK> madly and just enjoy the moment ."
i can scream as loud as i want because the bodies absorb the sound .
"i can jump up and down , laughing and <UNK> my hands ."
"i can just beam throughout while still maintaining my own <UNK> , which is important to me as i 've discovered ."
i like when no <#> looks at me sometimes .
"totally fulfilling , <UNK> , <UNK> of so much ."
"good live music , with an excellent sound system , is like being picked up , thrown down and being fucked hard ."
and when it 's that good you <UNK> for more and more and more ...
"i do n't recall the last time i 'd taken an entire summer off from anything , either school or work ."
i guess the next time i did so was this summer .
and it 's been the best thing i could have ever done for myself .
yoga was the beginning of all the awareness i 've been having this summer .
it 's been a beautiful and wild adventure .
answers are out there if you 're looking for them and you pay attention to the signs .
i 've made it my business to care about things my whole life .
but when i cared too much it would <UNK> affect my life .
if things did n't turn out the way i wanted it would <UNK> something inside me or it felt not unlike a cancer growing inside .
it 's kind of akin to being an <UNK> web <UNK> .
you go online and look up something very specific .
"not all of them have <#> % <UNK> , but you go onto the site anyway ."
"i 've decided to not care so much , and it sounds weird but it 's working for me ."
i can love my friends more because i expect absolutely nothing from .
and i can acknowledge all the love they can muster up for me .
it 's hard for most people to demonstrate love of all <UNK> .
"so i think i 'm helping , which is really good ."
my yoga instructor todd asked me to read an article from last saturday 's globe and mail .
it described his friend pete who died last summer and the circumstances involving the accident .
"the cause of his horrific demise , a <UNK> accident last summer in the <UNK> 's ."
todd told me pete had a <#> friends .
i find <#> are hard to maintain sometimes .
"born into wealth , developed and <UNK> the lifestyle , had friends in the same snack <UNK> ."
"at the age of <#> he had won awards for <UNK> "" <UNK> "" ."
why is my gut saying he ripped people off .
they get them for getting as much money as they can get their hands on .
i feel sorry that todd lost his best friend .
i do n't know what i 'd do without mine .
i think i do n't feel sorry for him because nothing bad ever happened to him .
he had an <UNK> relationship with his immediate family .
"yoga if done properly , and by this i mean <UNK> , <UNK> and with the fullest of breath , is many things ."
"<UNK> yoga involves a series of classic and not so classic yoga <UNK> , but done in a heated room ."
"through <UNK> <UNK> the instructor can control temperature and humidity , with the exception of extremely hot and humid conditions outside that may <UNK> <UNK> ."
[ an aside : this beer i 'm drinking sucks .
"nearly each time i finish practice i tend to say , "" that was the best yoga experience of my life ! """
"tonight 's class was , i have to say , though fear sounding <UNK> , the best yoga experience of my life !"
what makes yoga so different from <#> day to the next is directly linked to how different we are from <#> day to the next .
<#> day we might be upset over something that happened at work .
another day there may have been something said to a friend that could have used a bit more <UNK> .
"half of me wanted to , the other half just wanted to surf the net ."
"i could feel my ass <UNK> , so i packed my bag ."
todd 's got this great <UNK> dude meets radio <UNK> 's voice .
julie is simply <#> of the most beautiful people i 've ever seen .
"both are gentle , <UNK> yet make you challenge yourself ."
"i 'd been doing research , writing and planning an event throughout the day ."
"i felt good emotionally , but i really wanted to test my <UNK> <UNK> by going to yoga ."
"sometimes we convince ourselves that we 're fine , but there are issues that crop up every now and then ."
doing <UNK> really helps get down to the <UNK> - <UNK> of what we 're really feeling .
"i believe there is truth in <UNK> , but where the ultimate truth lies is in the breath ."
"in the first pose , i ca n't remember what it 's called ."
some guy choked on his spit at <#> time .
once upon a time i was n't crazy about back <UNK> .
"they open the heart <UNK> , the bits of us that allow all feelings to potentially emerge ."
this action tends to allow emotions that we have kept hidden inside to <UNK> out .
we tend to feel things either during or directly after pose .
there have been times i 've <UNK> after doing it .
how could a person whose heart was <UNK> broken <#> days ago possibly beam after that ?
"well , i felt like i had n't smiled for a while ."
i felt that i took advantage of a situation <UNK> and with honour .
"and the most <UNK> of all , i felt like i understood what i was supposed to do on this earth ."
i understood at that moment this was my job .
yoga manages the <UNK> in my life and the weird that i sometimes feel .
"it will bring me back to work soon , though ."
yoga made me understand fully that the only constant is change .
i found this while doing some research on life and love and stuff of general <UNK> .
", life would be like a smoothly <UNK> , straight , flat road to nowhere ."
"the <UNK> and <UNK> that you experience can create who you are , and the bad experiences can be learned from ."
"in fact , they are probably the most <UNK> and important ones ."
"make every day count , appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can , for you may never be able to experience it again ."
"let yourself fall in love , break free and set your sights high ."
hold your head up because you have every right to .
"tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself , for you do n't , no <#> else will believe in you ."
create your own life and then go out and live it .
"if you take your eyes off your goals , all you see are obstacles ."
"okay , so am i <UNK> because my heart is no longer broken ?"
"see , this <UNK> a <UNK> from a <UNK> blog which questioned my love for all <#> of the men i claimed to love ."
did he come along to ease my pain from missing david so much ?
"as psychic kim said , "" he 's coming back , but i 'm not sure whether you 'll want him again . """
i did listen to the tape today though .
the last time i saw psychic kim i 'd brought in a tape <UNK> .
"i now have this tape that has <#> different , yet very similar readings on it performed by <#> <UNK> ."
he raised the bar on the standards i 'd loosely set when considering a potential union of <#> .
i tend to solely consider the individual and the direct <UNK> he has with my heart .
"the rest of the stuff is irrelevant , really ."
"i mean , i do n't care what he does for a living , if he has a car , if he has a house , stuff in general ."
careful 's not really an <UNK> used to describe me .
"i do n't care what it is : tragic , <UNK> , angry , and ( <UNK> rare ) jealousy ."
it 's an opportunity to examine things and to know that i care deeply about things .
"david was the only person that ever , in any recent memory , inspired jealousy in me ."
"i never felt that while with mike , husband of <#> <#> years . never ."
"i do n't think a little jealousy is a bad thing , though ."
a bit of it means they mean something to you .
the possibility of them being taken away is potentially devastating .
maybe the universe has some grand design for me .
it inherently knows i 'm terrible with remembering lessons that were learned too easily .
i was merely an <UNK> in the <UNK> ward .
"just a little <UNK> , or <UNK> in the grand scheme of heart break ."
"i wrote to my friend <UNK> , "" every now and then it 's good to be a bit shattered ."
"it puts this delicious tragedy in your life , which in the end <UNK> it ."
"and then i smile to myself , an <UNK> and <UNK> smile , <UNK> , alone but not lonely and i feel good ."
i want to get this while i have it fresh on my plate .
i had made a resolve to fight for him .
"but the love for him was the kind that was sweet , familiar , deep but more in a special , special friend way ."
"i remember reading his profile and thinking , "" why do n't i already know this person ?"
"he seems like someone i 'd already be friends with . """
but i was n't yet and then i became <#> .
"and then he was wonderful , as they tend to be in the beginning , but in the end it was disappointing ."
"as my friend <UNK> said , "" best it happened now versus <#> months from now ."
""" apparently there is a direct <UNK> formula which describes the amount of time needed to heal a broken heart vs. the time spent loving someone ."
it had only been just over <#> weeks after all .
"ah , i 'm reminded of <UNK> baker right now ."
"<UNK> sang , "" i fall in love too easily ."
i fall in love too terribly hard for love to ever last .
""" that seems to be a <UNK> problem in my life ."
would that there was something that i could <UNK> for a while that was almost <UNK> .
"if not <UNK> , then maybe a slow <UNK> ."
i do n't know what i 'm racing for .
but maybe i do n't really want to know .
"i think the mission is to concentrate on what it is i need to do , to be ."
i found myself going through the same pulls as i did before .
i had decided not long ago that the next time was going to be different .
"i did spend more time with friends this time , which was good ."
"but the rest of it , the all consuming bits were still <UNK> of my old self ."
"can you help those , though ? is there that much of yourself that you can change ?"
"i do n't remember feeling that gross angst before , but they tend not to break up with me ."
and maybe it 's the <UNK> of a situation .
he had prepared himself for this at least a couple of days in advance .
just typically flying by the seat of my pants . again .
the worst part of it is i ca n't listen to half of my music library right now without thinking of him .
the best part is he 's had the <UNK> i 'd always lacked .
i do n't really have that list of requirements that need to be filled when looking for someone .
i have to remember the time spent with him .
it 's very important that i remember the time .
and i have to be able to have that kind of special the next time around .
he gave me hope that something really good could exist .
"i have to know that , to remember that ."
so there were good things that came out of this :
<#> . i got to really care about someone again ; something i love to do .
"<#> . i now have to examine whether this is a serious problem in my life , the whole love addiction thing ."
<#> . we were very good friends and eventually we will be great friends .
the roles we end up playing throughout our lives .
i was the last child born in a family of <#> children .
"in my family as well as others the <UNK> child was expected to lead the others , to be an example ."
"the second child if , god help him/her is born the same sex as the <UNK> that child will always live in the shadow his <UNK> ."
"they do n't really expect much from the baby , especially when the baby laughed all the time and developed a special <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> ."
"i say strangely because both parents came from china , both from rural areas , at a fairly young age ."
they were in their late teens to early twenties .
"no sense of real belonging , only a need to <UNK> and not draw too much attention to themselves ."
"they were , not fully understanding the culture of their heritage , not fully <UNK> into canadian culture either , effectively lost between <#> worlds ."
dad did n't really wait the appropriate amount of time before <UNK> mom again .
"siblings vince , walter and <UNK> were born in consecutive years starting from <#> ."
<UNK> was the youngest and the only girl for <#> years of her life .
there 's a different kind of attention paid to girls by the father .
"there are less expectations , or just expectations in a different realm ."
"more of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , a care for the elderly agreement in blood sort ."
"growing up in that time , in a fairly <UNK> <UNK> , meant <UNK> the children with the <UNK> and <UNK> idea that study was <UNK> to success ."
study led to the <UNK> of money and goods .
as hard as they would study he would make them study harder because of their <UNK> .
he convinced them that the world would not view their abilities and <UNK> based on their <UNK> alone .
"the world would view the <UNK> in their eyes and their general facial features first , <UNK> them to more <UNK> positions based primarily on racial <UNK> ."
"he 'd often pit <#> <UNK> against the other , as if it was some <UNK> test for his love ."
"it was never the quality of your friendships that mattered , it was the <UNK> and how full your activities schedule was ."
all <#> of us are very different in personality .
"publicly the <UNK> , laughing and smiling if he can make a buck off you ."
"walter , super athlete and will tell anyone who has ears all about it , tendency toward violence , but is <UNK> ."
"funny , but prone to telling the same stories from his "" glory years "" in high school ."
father thought all he would ever amount to was being a blue collar worker in a factory setting .
"<UNK> has been accused by my <UNK> of having "" eyes on her forehead "" because she looks down on people ."
refuses to drive her car through certain <UNK> for fear of being robbed or raped .
"i am considered the "" black sheep "" of the family ."
"had a "" talk "" by my sister about not embarrassing her at her wedding ."
"is the "" pot - <UNK> "" of the family ."
"in common we share the spirit of survival , <UNK> , loyalty to our friends , <UNK> , a profound difficulty to rely on others ."
"we all know that if vince is confronted he will back down and <UNK> , feeling embarrassed by other 's <UNK> , mostly because his own emotions <UNK> himself ."
we all know that walter will break something ; a door or a heart .
currently he 's <UNK> himself from the entire family .
"we know <UNK> will <UNK> , spinning the argument in a totally different direction , leading the <UNK> to a confused state ."
she will likely try to be the victor at any cost .
or i gave too much away at well below <UNK> list prices .
we still have funny pulls and <UNK> though .
"the other night having <UNK> , jeremy and i were discussing movie going characteristics ."
i tend to see movies alone for a variety of reasons .
"he talks during movies , which i admittedly am not crazy about ."
it 's louder to me than the movie is .
he then said something about how loud i laughed and did n't i think that was <UNK> to others ?
all the feelings of their attempts to <UNK> me came to the surface .
"tell her to be less , less than she is ."
we just need to make slight <UNK> . ]
we grow up and think we 're grown - ups now .
how could we possibly have the same pulls we did when we were kids .
lots of people have commented on the fact that my laugh is approximately <#> <UNK> ( <#> is the average pain <UNK> ) .
"but at that moment , maybe because he 'd just dumped me i was feeling particularly vulnerable and extremely self - protective ."
at that exact moment all i felt was you can not make comments or <UNK> <UNK> about things a person can not change .
"along with these <UNK> , we have this <UNK> sense of our duties and <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is the self - <UNK> , self - imposed "" do - the - right - thing "" girl ."
i want to deal in the currency of people .
"i want to make people think , to make them feel it 's okay to feel what they 're feeling ."
"it 's honesty , something that this society lacks so often ."
our roles as people are as unique as we as individuals are .
"to be brave is to take risks , risks out of <#> 's own character ."
things that scare us a little ... or a lot .
i want to experience as much as i can so i can share my experiences with others .
"we 've all felt the diverse , often <UNK> , feelings of pain and suffering ."
and i hope upon hopes that we 've all felt love .

so feel free express your opinions and by all means rant if you feel the need .
many on the left think that we need to find out why the terrorists hate us so much and find a way to make them like us .
the only way we can make them like us is to convert in mass to their radical version of islam and <UNK> our women like they do .
i do n't think even our liberal friends would find that an acceptable solution .

i think the <UNK> found the best way for creating wealth and enterprise in a desert as well as <UNK> people in meaningful jobs .

until they do we will come up with ways of making sure they do not kill us .
"funny - i could stay out and do whatever , but the first thing i did when i got home was clean the kitchen ."
do n't know why i decided to create a blog today .
i 've thought about it for a while .
why not - everyone else is doing it .
even though i got caught in the rain <#> times .
and the pain level is at about a <#> .
school starts in <#> weeks . not ready ! !
it 's amazing how the days after a perfect vacation can be so miserable .
"well , lots of things to think and stress about ."
"but wow , that was a great trip ."
"we got to <UNK> thursday night , after driving through a lot of standing water on <UNK> <#> ."
we got to say hello to the beach while we waited for others to arrive .
"we found out later that it would only be <#> of us , but in the end that seemed perfect ."
"friday , we started the day with a devotion and life story ."
i went first and they got an ear full .
and i think it was at least <#> .
show and tell of the <UNK> and <UNK> .
"i had just been diagnosed with <UNK> on thursday afternoon , so that was my chance to let everyone know ."
"first , philip <UNK> me on a <UNK> board ."
"he <UNK> me down , and i yelled at him , "" get off of me ! ! """
"i was so mad , i turned around and dove back into the next wave ."
"within a few seconds , i was hundreds of feet down the beach , unable to stand up ."
"the current was so strong after the hurricane , i could n't believe it ."
"between the pounding waves and that current , i really started to get scared ."
i kept trying to get back to the shore but i could n't make it .
<UNK> got there just as i managed to get out on all <UNK> .
she helped me to the shore where i <UNK> for breath for a while ( and did n't even feel a crab crawling on me ) .
then she and <UNK> helped me back to where everyone else was .
i literally had about <#> cups worth of sand in my bathing suit .
not half as worried as i was about myself .
we gave up and went back to the <UNK> for lunch .
so it turned out that the south - facing beach was absolutely peaceful .
we headed over there and i finally got to float like i love .
"then we packed up the cars and headed for <UNK> shrimp , only to find out that it was too late ."
so we headed back and had our <UNK> instead .
"then we went for frozen <UNK> at uncle <UNK> 's , and isaac offered us a free round of golf ."
i got <#> real whole in <#> and <#> <UNK> ones .
my best round of <UNK> - <UNK> ever - a <#> .
i started to get really tired that night .
"had a major <UNK> with philip after that , but it was good in the end ."
i was very glad to get all that off of my chest .
it 's amazing how creepy it is when he tries to touch me .
i do n't even want to shake his hand .
started with mark <UNK> into our room while i was still in my <UNK> .
"he started cooking breakfast , and i just stayed on the couch until i could make a <UNK> for the bathroom ."
"he messed up the pancakes and smoked up the room while trying to cook bacon , but it was pretty cute ."
"then we moved to our new room , and <#> more folks shared life stories ."
"mark shared his , and i just wanted to hold him afterward ."
i had a vision about god turning the <UNK> <UNK> of his heart into diamond <UNK> gold .
"then the news came back that the surf was perfect , including for me wanting to float ."
"so we went out , and sure enough , i got to float for at least <#> hours ."
i had a hard time accepting that it was time to come in .
that was when god gave me the refrain : it is enough .
"i feel like i have to write a <UNK> about that , but i 'm not sure what it needs to say yet ."
"then we went for <#> cent shrimp again , and that was wonderful ."
"then , the most amazing - <UNK> in the sound at sunset ."
i wish i could do that every day .
"okay , so i 'd settle for once a month ."
"mark talked to sarah a lot , but they talked about ethics and i do n't have to know everything about ethics ."
"she does , because she 's getting a phd in it ."
she 's jealous of me for my overseas work .
i do n't have to be jealous of her .
"note to self : if that 's available , get it every time !"
sat next to mark again . felt like we connected on a few things .
including the fact that we ordered exactly the same meal .
"sad <UNK> eyes , but the laugh lines are n't <UNK> , so they stand out more now ."
then i went and watched the moon over the water while the others sang .
beautiful to watch the <UNK> of the <UNK> on the sea <UNK> as the waves came in .
mark and i walked up to the <UNK> together .
"i was hoping to talk to him , but his car was there and he had to drive it back . have a good night ."
so i went to my room and stared at the stars a while .
then i went in and saw his travel mug there .
"had to bring it back to him , right ?"
"but when i went into his hotel room , he was changing ."
decided if i woke up by 7:30 i 'd go to church .
told him i came because it reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> baptist .
that 's partially the reason . partially because i really just wanted to be near him .
god gave me the verse <UNK> <UNK> - she considered him faithful who had promised .
i know that without a shadow of a doubt .
why do i feel like i have so little faith otherwise ?
i hope people understood a little more about him then .
finished up mark e 's haircut while mt and i talked .
thought about telling him . but did n't quite fit .
encouraged me to get into a support group .
he looked at me like i was insane .
at least i did get a hug out of it .
i 'm glad he was taking care of her .
i would have rather been at the beach .
"must get my <UNK> paperwork done by tomorrow afternoon . which is worse , paperwork or cleaning mouse <UNK> out of the <UNK> ?"
"between the <#> , i just want to stay in bed ."
how much of my procrastination is related to fm ?
"not being able to think straight , or too deeply ?"
it hurts to have to think that hard .
i have a <UNK> in my left arm today .
"pain right now about a <#> , but i 'm back on <UNK> ."
i know you 're using these trials to shape me .
but i feel pretty darn well shaped already .
ca n't we <UNK> up for a little while ?
whatever happened to <UNK> the years the <UNK> have eaten ?
i 've never had many problems with my teeth .
that 's changing . apart from having wisdom teeth removed

it 's not easy because i 'm trying to actively avoid parts of it and get to parts i like .
"it 's a rare ( for me ) <UNK> book and is called "" she 's gonna blow ."
""" sadly , it 's not <UNK> at all , but actually about mothers dealing with anger and frustration towards their children ."
"it 's written in that <UNK> , i'm - just - like - you , sort of way -- <UNK> , warm , friendly ."
"my friend ( who lent me the book ) warned me about this , since i 'm not currently christian myself ."
"she said it was still a good read , and gave her some helpful ideas ."
"i do n't know , the religious aspects are pretty dominant ."
it 's more about forgiving yourself for screaming yourself <UNK> by realizing god will understand and forgive you .

i just put a fresh <#> in here yesterday .
"there is also no toilet paper to be seen , except tiny , <UNK> <UNK> stuck to the floor ."
"<#> , there is a powder - blue <UNK> cup floating in the toilet ."
was the cup used to <UNK> the <UNK> after the final flush of the paper that had been <UNK> <UNK> of ?
"i 'll never know , as i did n't have the energy to quiz the <UNK> <UNK> ."
they were <UNK> with laughter and knocking into furniture and each other .
the bucket made the <UNK> more difficult since it provided <#> <UNK> .
the basket at least had open <UNK> to see out a little bit .
"of course , they fought over which <#> would wear the bucket ."
there 's no logical reason to dye <#> 's hair .
the sharp chemical smell is familiar as it <UNK> brown and jelly - like onto my head .
i 'm flowing and giddy with this absurd shade .

"i 'll give you a dance and all that , because the flowers were really thoughtful ."
"but i 've already got a ride there , okay ? "" ."

the ongoing nature of her mother ’s hobby was reflected by the <UNK> stack of used puzzle - boxes on top of the narrow side table .

""" how many of those have you had already ?"
""" arianna asked , feeling a bit nervous about what the answer might be ."

"she watched him <UNK> off across the room , a small sigh escaping from her ."
"obviously , he was more taken by the alcohol rather than her , she decided ."
"still , he was rather handsome , and she made a mental note to that effect instead ."
"arianna thought to herself , as she watched rick from her <UNK> point , sitting in the shadows near the stereo system ."
just been talking with peter ( who was looking rather ‘
"<UNK> by that stage of the evening ) , and arianna had heard them mentioning an upcoming rock concert , of a band that she was familiar with ."
"so , a few moments after peter <UNK> got to his feet ( possibly on his way to the bathroom ? )"
"” , arianna asked ( hoping she sounded confident ) , as she <UNK> at the bright orange <UNK> beside him ."
"his eyes slowly <UNK> , as he raised them to meet her face ."
"she couldn’t mistake the slow , easy smile that slid across his full lips as he <UNK> her ; she felt her heart skip a beat at that response ."
"ahh , i think it was meant for you , ”"
"rick responded , then he moved his arm over and <UNK> up the top of the <UNK> seat ."
"as arianna sat down slowly , she was aware that rick had left his hand resting there , now just behind her right shoulder ."
“ what brings a girl like you to a place like this ?
", ” he asked , a trace of humour obvious in his tone of voice ."
"arianna let out a small laugh at that , before responding with , <UNK> has to be the <UNK> line in the book ” ."
"they both <UNK> for a few moments , and arianna felt her tension begin to ease ."
"“ i hear you’re a <UNK> fan ” , she continued ."
"” , he asked , a <UNK> grin on his face ."
"greg mentioned it earlier on , how you , he and ben were thinking of going to their concert at athletic park next month ” ."
"he leaned towards her a bit , and his hand came to rest on her shoulder ."
"well , your information may indeed be correct ; that is , if we can get the tickets before they sell out .... ”"
* arianna and rick had an easy conversation for nearly half an hour - they seemed to ‘ hit it <UNK> quite well .
"after the initial <UNK> , <UNK> settled down into discussing their respective musical tastes ; then <UNK> talked about general stuff ."
"he’d been quite the gentleman , and she had found herself enjoying his company , and smiling at his off - beat sense of humour ."
"there were longer <UNK> , more and more lingering looks into each others eyes ; and she had been leaning her right hand on his chest ."
"then , he said something funny about his <UNK> ed teacher , and arianna laughed , her face leaning down towards his shoulder ."
"hey ” , he said quietly ; and <UNK> looked up to find his face mere inches from her own ."
", anthony had loudly interrupted , as he’d walked up to them ; and the moment had broken before <UNK> <UNK> ."
"rick had <UNK> himself to her , before following his mate out the side door ."
"before the <UNK> even had time to cool , some guy called aaron had sat down next to her ."
<UNK> and greg had spent most of the night out on the trampoline ; <#> could only guess at what the attraction had been out there ?
"arianna had found herself being <UNK> to a long <UNK> from aaron , who seemed to be intent on <UNK> her with his stunning personality ."
"it hadn’t worked - she was not at all impressed at his <UNK> that as he came from a family of <#> children , he considered himself a ‘"
"<UNK> by the time greg and <UNK> returned <UNK> , it was close to midnight ."
having spent the last quarter of an hour trying to convince aaron that she wasn’t ‘
"<UNK> , it was with much relief that arianna welcomed <UNK> 's saying , "" c'mon , <UNK> ; better get you home ."
"we kinda lost track of the time ... "" ."
"ben said that he 's off out the back again , <UNK> up his breakfast , "" greg answered ."
""" why the interest ? "" asked <UNK> . """
""" hmm , "" said <UNK> , "" well , we 're not having him <UNK> all over the car ."

"arianna wanted to protest the ruling , but instead she went with them . ' after all ' , she thought , ' i hardly know the guy ' ."
"within a few minutes of saying their goodbyes , they were on their way back from <UNK> ."
"she could hear <UNK> and greg discussing her - they seemed to have figured out that she liked rick , anyhow ."
""" we 'll see what we can do , "" <UNK> said to greg ."
it was the following saturday evening - a week since valentine ’s day : <UNK> and greg were taking arianna to see crazy for you at the movie cinema .
"<UNK> picked her up after <#> pm , and were now driving their way up to greg ’s house to get <UNK> ’s jacket ."
"by now , they were driving through the eastern <UNK> of <UNK> ; arianna <UNK> watched the <UNK> painted <UNK> and <UNK> gardens as they drove past them ."
it was like a whole different view to the <UNK> looking ‘
"<UNK> houses from her home town of <UNK> , she found herself thinking ; she decided you could almost feel the air of middle - class <UNK> here ."
"“ hey , greg - isn’t that rick ’s place ? , ”"
"<UNK> said , pointing to the large white house a little further up the road they were now driving down ."
"alright , ” greg replied slowly , a trace of a <UNK> <UNK> the corners of his mouth ."
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him from where she sat in the front passenger seat , <UNK> something to him ."
"” the car stopped suddenly in front of a neat white <UNK> fence , with a slightly <UNK> <UNK> from it ’s <UNK> . ‘"
"she turned to see greg <UNK> his seat belt . “ back in a minute , then , ” he said , before opening the driver ’s side door ."
arianna didn’t mistake the quick wink he gave <UNK> just before his face disappeared out of sight .
""" hey , <UNK> - what time does the movie start again ?"
"” <UNK> replied , as she reached over and <UNK> on the car radio ; “ heaps of time ” ."
several minutes passed ; the girls had wound down all the car windows in an effort to cool the interior of the car .
"<UNK> certainly aren’t made for comfort arianna thought to herself , as she shifted <UNK> in her seat . “"
"<UNK> , what ’s taking greg so long - ” she began , before being <UNK> by an <UNK> tap - tapping on the rear window ."
"arianna turned around <UNK> , to see rick ’s face smiling at her , as he stood on the <UNK> at to the back of the car . “"
"<UNK> called to her , getting out of the car as greg <UNK> explained , “"
rick ’s invited us in for a quick drink ” .
"<UNK> gently took her by the arm , and <UNK> her toward the front gate , a <UNK> smile on her face ."
"the <#> guys were already making their way down the steep front steps , their deep voices <UNK> words on the impending rugby game that weekend ."
"arianna <UNK> stopped walking , and turned to face her sister ."
"” she whispered , her voice <UNK> by nerves ."
"“ let ’s just wait and see , shall we , ”"
"<UNK> quietly replied , meeting arianna ’s eyes with an even gaze ."
i know you wanted to see him again ” .
"couldn’t hide her <UNK> this time , and <UNK> <UNK> her with a quick half - hug , telling her “"
"wasn’t so sure , but started walking down the steps behind her sister just the same ."
"so , what do you think about him , then ? ,"
"” <UNK> <UNK> to arianna , as they stood at the far end of the pool table ."
"greg and rick were at the other end , by the stereo , laughing about something ."
"<UNK> shot her a black look , but arianna couldn’t shake the feeling ."
"she almost thought the guys were laughing about her , and she felt so out - of - place , so ‘"
"“ your turn , ” greg called over to them ."
"<UNK> walked over to the table , <UNK> lifting the pool cue ."
"“ watch this and be truly amazed , ” she said <UNK> ; before lining up and sinking <#> balls with <#> trick shot ."
this was followed by a <UNK> ‘ <UNK> between the <#> of them .
"arianna glanced over at rick , and found he was staring back at her , his eyes darker somehow ."
he couldn’t figure out why arianna was being so off hand to him :
"<UNK> barely spoken to him in the past <#> minutes , instead sticking close to her sister ."
"not wanting to be shown up , he decided that maybe he’d <UNK> the situation when he’d first met her ."
"as he saw her turn her eyes away from him , and cross her arms <UNK> , he felt a pang of frustration ."
"it looked like she didn’t like him after all ; and he’d been looking forward to seeing her again , too ."
rick walked up to the pool table and grabbed a spare cue .
arianna was right behind him now ; she tried not to breathe : he was so close .
"<UNK> and greg by now stood with their arms around each other , breathing heavily , looking rather <UNK> after their playful <UNK> ."
"go on then , big man , ” <UNK> <UNK> , before she gave greg a long , lingering kiss ."
"rick glanced over his shoulder , to see that arianna was now looking down at the floor ."
this wasn’t going at all the way he’d hoped .
"rick turned <UNK> , and shoved the pool cue on to the table , trying not to let his disappointment show . “"
"sorry , but <UNK> have to wait ‘ til some other time ; i’ve got a party to go to , ” he said , his voice low ."
"arianna looked up , her eyes <UNK> , a sense of dread filling her bones ."
<UNK> and greg seemed oblivious to the tension <UNK> in the air between the other <#> .
"well , we’d better get going ourselves , or we’ll miss those <UNK> <UNK> ’s before the movie , ” <UNK> <UNK> ."
", i can’t wait , ” greg <UNK> <UNK> , then started in on a <UNK> <UNK> of the trumpet <UNK> ad ."
<UNK> - but she was disturbed by the way that rick was now <UNK> .
"he’d walked over to the doorway by now , and was throwing on his black <UNK> <UNK> ."
"so , i’ll see you guys ‘ round , ”"
“ you can show yourselves out - i was <UNK> to have met anthony <#> minutes ago ... ” .
"arianna watched silently now , as he <UNK> out the back door ; and she <UNK> as it slammed behind him ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> - let ’s get going , ” <UNK> called , <UNK> miss madonna ’s movie debut , can we ? ” ."
"<UNK> was giggling loudly , but arianna felt strangely <UNK> ."
that sinking feeling she sometimes got had hit an all time low ...
"* the car pulled up outside the theatre , and <UNK> glanced back over her shoulder at arianna ."
<UNK> - you’ve been as quiet as a mouse back there - you okay ?
", arianna explained , managing to <UNK> a weak smile , before adding , “"
"i’m still trying to get back into the swing of studying again , you know how it is ” ."
"<UNK> <UNK> briefly , then turned her attention back to greg . “"
"well , we had better get a <UNK> sorted out pretty quick - it ’s quarter past <#> already , ”"
“ there should be a space or <#> left behind the midnight <UNK> ” .
"several minutes later , the <#> of them were walking down courtney place , <UNK> <UNK> talking about the upcoming <UNK> concert . “"
arianna ’s mood had <UNK> up considerably ; <UNK> ’s cheerful <UNK> had reminded her why she had come out in the first place .
; cousin <UNK> is already <UNK> her tickets down from new <UNK> .
"a cool <UNK> <UNK> at their heels , <UNK> them along ."
"“ heck - the movie will be starting soon , ” greg <UNK> ."
"better get a move on , girls ! ” ."
"by now , their conversation had come to the movie close at hand ; they could see the bright lights of the <UNK> theatre up ahead ."
"“ apparently madonna ’s <UNK> appearance is rather su - <UNK> , ” <UNK> said in a <UNK> voice , and they all <UNK> at her ‘"
"“ wow - looks like some people are desperate enough to go to anything on a saturday night ! , ”"
"greg said loudly , to be <UNK> at by several of the crowd . “"
"ahh , well - people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones , ”"
"<UNK> added , as they fell into line behind the rest of the movie - <UNK> . “"
"<UNK> , strangers ! , ” a male voice called from nearby ."
"arianna looked over her shoulder , and was surprised to see rick walking up to them . “"
"hi to you , too , rick , ” greg called back ."
thought you were going to catch up with anthony and the others ... ” .
"by now , rick was standing next to arianna : she found she couldn’t stop looking up at him ."
"“ fancy seeing you lot again so soon ” , he said , <UNK> down at arianna ."
"when he saw her <UNK> gaze , he gave her a warm smile : perhaps i was right to come here afterall , he decided ."
"“ well - it ’s <#> now ; and this queue ’s not getting shorter very fast , ”"
"<UNK> pointed out , “ so we may as well come and join you ” ."
"* as they walked out of the restaurant and into the cool evening air , there was a general feeling of <UNK> in the air ."
the <#> of them joking around and chatting freely ; the earlier <UNK> between arianna and rick long since forgotten . “
"you’d better get going , rick ; it ’s nearly <#> now , ”"
"ah , what the hey - ” rick responded , “ i think i’ll tag along with you guys for awhile - if you don’t mind ! ” ."
couldn’t stop herself from smiling widely at that suggestion . “
", she said , before any <#> else had time to reply ."
"rick looked over at arianna , and was impressed to see her <UNK> watching him now , her eyes almost challenging him to do something - <UNK> ."
“ perhaps we can have a smoke ? ” .
"they then headed back in the general direction of the <UNK> , the mood flowing smoothly as they went ."
"it was an isolated spot , with a flat area about half the size of a football field , backed by a near - vertical <UNK> ."
"<UNK> and greg were sitting up on the <UNK> of the <UNK> , leaning heavily on each other ."
"the sound of the car radio kept the immediate atmosphere <UNK> , and everyone seemed to be filled with a sense of expectation ."
"of what , none of them really knew - but they were all <UNK> with it , regardless ."
"“ it ’s turning out to be an interesting night , after all , ”"
"<UNK> commented , to no - <#> in particular - the others all made noises of agreement ."
"“ must be the full moon , ” suggested arianna ."
"greg gave her a knowing smile , before adding , “ and maybe we’ll even do some beach - <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ” ."
"they all laughed at that , a mixture of <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"as they watched <UNK> and greg <UNK> into the semi - dark , arianna found herself <UNK> wandering if she and rick might ever share that kind of <UNK> ."
"even as the end of her thought <UNK> off , rick spoke ."
“ look - i’m sorry about being me having been so off - hand earlier on
... it ’s just that i’ve had alot on my mind lately ” .
"arianna turned to face him , her eyes meeting his ; she could see a trace of <UNK> in his expression . “"
"“ yep , that ’s the <#> ” , arianna agreed ."
"“ it ’s a funny old world , alright ” , rick continued ."
"“ i certainly didn’t think that you and i would be here like this , now ” ."
"arianna wandered if he was reading her mind , and the insight of his words made her start to feel insecure ."
"she nodded in agreement , even as her heart began racing with a sudden sense of panic ."
"she found herself at a loss for words , and maybe even a little <UNK> by his close <UNK> ."
"as he moved to sit down on the back seat of the car , she began walking in the opposite direction , towards the shadows of the <UNK> ."
"when arianna was <#> feet or so from the car , she turned around to watch him ; feeling safer somehow , hidden by the night ."
"she <UNK> down on her <UNK> , then tried to stay as <UNK> as possible ."
arianna could make out the sound of <UNK> man ’s ‘ a room that <UNK> playing on the car radio .
"after a few minutes , she saw rick stand up , and slowly start walking in the general direction of where <UNK> headed off in earlier ."
"after a few <UNK> , he stopped and called out to her , “ <UNK> !"
"she <UNK> softly to herself , as she saw him turning back towards the car ."
"he turned back around , as if he may have heard her ; then he <UNK> , “"
i may have to eat them all on my lone - some ” .
"that made her laugh <UNK> this time , and she saw his face turn <UNK> in her direction ."
"he finished , before he walked back to the car ."
"she didn’t here the words he whispered to himself then : “ and i wish you were close to me , now ” ."
"sure , he had plenty of friends - but it was his ‘"
and his mother was always so busy with her <UNK> and church groups .
"‘ real middle - class <UNK> stuff , he called it . ‘"
<UNK> rick ’s deep line of thought was <UNK> by the sight of arianna re - emerging out of the late evening shadows .
"” , arianna asked , as she came within a few steps of him ."
"oh ” , arianna began , as she now stood only a couple of feet in front of him , “"
"” . they both looked each other in the eye after that , an <UNK> understanding passing between them ."
"after several moments , rick simply said , “ food , then ?"
"arianna nodded , and sat down beside him on the boot of the car ."
"<UNK> whispered to greg , just before they got within hearing distance of the others , “"
i told you that there was something there ... ” .
"“ we wondered when you <#> might be getting back , ”"
"from his loud <UNK> , she must have ‘ meant <UNK> “ besides , it ’s time we did get going , ” <UNK> finished ."
"however , once <UNK> all gotten back in the car and greg got the engine going , it quickly became apparent that they had a problem ."
"as the car slowly started to make it ’s way back across the grass verge , it <UNK> <UNK> to <#> side , followed by an <UNK> <UNK> . “"
"ahh , <UNK> , greg cursed , “ looks like we’ve got a <UNK> ” ."
"he shut the engine off again , and climbed out to take a look ; rick followed him to <UNK> the <UNK> in question ."
"sure enough , the driver ’s side front <UNK> was <UNK> ; on closer examination , they found it was torn clean down the middle ."
"<UNK> driven over a smashed bottle , ” rick suggested ."
"greg gave him a black stare , before answering in an <UNK> tone , “ thank you for your insightful observation , mr bright boy ” ."
"greg walked up to the front passenger window , and <UNK> wound it down ."
"he stuck in his head , his intense frown making it clear that the news wasn’t good ."
"well , ladies - it has become apparent that we won’t be driving anywhere else tonight ."
"as the car had a <UNK> last week , the <#> that ’s now died is the spare ! ” ."
"<UNK> and arianna climbed out of the car , carrying their shoulder bags ."
", <UNK> said matter - of - <UNK> , before asking , “ how far is it to your place from here , greg ? ” ."
"he paused for a moment , before <UNK> ."
"if we go up the concrete <UNK> that are a few minutes up the road , it will take us about half an hour on foot ."
"but those stairs are damn steep ” , he added ."
"<#> minutes later , they were climbing the hundreds of steps up the back of <UNK> ."
"greg and <UNK> lead the way , their voices going back and forth between them in a warm <UNK> ."
"rick and arianna were several <UNK> behind them , silent apart from their <UNK> breathing ."
arianna found her thoughts <UNK> up ; there was a growing sense of <UNK> in the pit of her stomach .
she stopped walking suddenly ; rick turned to her to see why she had paused . “
"<UNK> , ” he <UNK> ’s the matter ? ” ."
"i - i’m cold ” , she replied ” , <UNK> her comment with a visible shudder . “"
"here then , wear my jacket , ” he <UNK> ."
"she nodded quickly , and he transferred his <UNK> coat , <UNK> it over her shoulders ; he left his hands resting on them ."
"” , he <UNK> , trying to meet her eyes ."
she fixed her gaze on the ground between her feet . “
"as they <UNK> walking , rick slipped his left arm around her shoulders , and she felt her shoulders relax ."
arianna found she liked him holding her so closely ; and rick couldn’t seem to stop smiling for the rest of their journey up the path .
"* “ guess i had better get going ” , rick said , as he stood up from the kitchen table ."
"the <#> of them had all been sitting in the kitchen at greg ’s house , having a hot drink each and talking ."
“ oh ... do you have to go yet ? ”
", arianna asked , her voice letting on her <UNK> ."
"“ well , i’ve already missed the last bus back to <UNK> , ” rick explained , “ and it ’s a <#> minute walk ” ."
"arianna was at a loss as what to say in response , so she simply nodded instead ."
"“ it ’s been good having you ‘ round again , rick mate ” , greg said . “"
"i’ll go downstairs and make up the spare beds ” , <UNK> suggested ."
“ greg - can you show me where the blankets are ?
"“ you know , <UNK> : over by the - ” , greg began . “"
"remind me ” , <UNK> said <UNK> , before gently grabbing him by the arm and <UNK> him towards the hall doorway ."
"round then , rick ” , she finished , and greg gave them a quick wave as they <UNK> around the corner ."
"he raised his eyebrows <UNK> , then his smile <UNK> further and he said , “ back at you ... ” ."
"he leaned down , his face now only a few inches from hers ; and their eyes met <UNK> ."
i want him to kiss <UNK> she found herself thinking .
"suddenly feeling awkward , he broke their gaze , saying , “"
i really had better get going ... ” .
"arianna felt like her head was spinning ; <UNK> , she got up from her seat at the table ."
"they both walked over to the door , then she took the jacket off and handed it back to him . “"
"thanks for that ” , arianna said , as he reached over for it , then <UNK> pulled it on ."
"“ my pleasure , <UNK> lady ” , rick <UNK> in a fake <UNK> accent ."
"he gave her a wide , <UNK> smile in response ."
"“ you better count on it ” , he said softly ."
"before she could say anything else , he had already opened the back door ."
"good ” , he said , and then turned to go ."
arianna watched <UNK> as he carefully closed the door behind him .
"” , she whispered to the now closed door ."
"<UNK> , she quietly pulled back the covers on the bed , and sat up slowly ."
"she could hear <UNK> ’s slow breathing from the other spare bed , on the other side of the room ."
"in the <UNK> <UNK> room , she could make out the shape of the windows behind the closed curtains ."
"gently , she put her feet on the <UNK> - <UNK> floor , catching her breath at the <UNK> it presented her bed - <UNK> toes ."
"she could feel the <UNK> <UNK> their way up her legs and bare arms , but she felt drawn to continue towards the <UNK> glass ."
"<UNK> , arianna lifted the fabric curtains ; the <UNK> pattern on them <UNK> dark <UNK> against a lighter tone ."
"in the distance , the <UNK> street lights from <UNK> were visible ; they <UNK> like small orange - coloured stars ."
the night sky was clear ; the full moon a pale neon blue on the <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> sky .
"she stood there for a few minutes ; her thoughts now abstract , feeling connected to some stronger sense of being ."
it was both frightening and <UNK> at the same time ; she had never been so affected by a guy ’s presence before .
"i hardly know him , but i can’t stop thinking about him ..."
she was surprised to find that the thought didn’t <UNK> her at all ; it was instead like something vital was starting to fall into place for her .
"she could feel her heart racing , and knew that even now , she was smiling ; and that she couldn’t wait to see him again ..."
"arianna tried not to let herself cry - after all , they 'd only been a ' casual couple ' for the past <#> months now ."
but it still did n't make it any easier to admit that he was right .
""" do what you need to do , rick ... "" , arianna managed to say , though it made her feel like a <UNK> to herself ."
"he was <UNK> waving his arms around as he spoke now , as he turned to face her ."
"rick stopped suddenly , and walked up to where she was sitting : that shook her out of her unpleasant day - dream . """
"he almost <UNK> , <UNK> his audience was n't paying him enough attention . """
"i 've thought about this a lot , and i know that we need to <UNK> our options . """
"once he saw her nod her head , he continued his speech ."
"you are all i 've ever known ” , rick said with an air of drama . as he continued his <UNK>"

""" i think we need to ... see other people ."
this will be a good opportunity for both of us .
"you can see that , ca n't you ? "" ."
"arianna was sitting quietly on the sofa , her eyes lowered , as she swallowed back the urge to cry ."
rick found her <UNK> silence frustrating : arianna had always had something to say for herself .
"but , now , she sat there <UNK> , saying nothing at all ."
"rick stopped in front of her again ; and this time , he <UNK> down on <#> knee ."
""" <UNK> - you know i 'm right , do n't you ? """
"arianna bit at her lip , and nodded slowly ."
"he pressed a warm , gentle kiss on her forehead ; and she closed her eyes , forcing salty tears to slip out onto her cheeks ."
"he closed his eyes then , and let his head rest on her lap ."
"arianna rested her head gently on his , and imagined that at that moment , she felt her heart split in <#> ."
"let 's get going ! "" , <UNK> called from the front doorway ."
"arianna had been day - dreaming again : it often seemed she was ' in a world of her own ' , as her mother called it ."
<UNK> wondered what was bugging her - but she thought she probably knew the answer : rick as usual .
"it was time to ' move on ' with her life . """
"the taxi is here - and <UNK> was expecting us to arrive nearly an hour ago ! "" ."
"arianna shook her head , trying to clear her thoughts ."
"it 'd been too long since rick had last written to her , she felt ."
"he 'd left at the end of january , promising to "" keep in touch "" , and had told her that he still loved her ."
"she pulled her thoughts back to the present , trying to <UNK> the <UNK> that suddenly seemed to wash over her ."

the excitement of the close call still had them talking <UNK> when they got off at the city stop .

"within minutes of getting in the door , <UNK> and the other party - <UNK> had made them both feel right at home ."
"still feeling sorry for herself about rick 's absence , arianna had drunken far too much vodka , in a <UNK> effort to drown her <UNK> ."

"i 'll go and find <UNK> for you . """
"arianna just nodded her head <UNK> , and slid down the wall , legs <UNK> ."
the rest of the late evening had gone by in an alcohol - induced blur for arianna .
<UNK> had indeed come to her aid - and had managed to help her <UNK> back into the main room .
"arianna had <UNK> , as the pain in her head felt like it could split her skull in <#> ."
"' so much for feeling better ' , she thought to herself , feeling miserable at her <UNK> state ."
* it was another sunday night ; just over a week after her 19th birthday .
"thank goodness easter break started this week ' , she thought to herself , as she sat at her desk in her bedroom ."
"she , by her <UNK> , was neither - the friendly <UNK> she shared with her fellow class - mates didn’t extend beyond lecture hours ."
"if it wasn’t for <UNK> , she knew that she would probably have been spending every weekend at home , <UNK> over her absent sometime boyfriend ... """
"darn you , rick - why did you have to go ? ! """
she asked the framed photograph sitting at the far end of her desk .
"instead , she walked down to the kitchen , with a view to making herself a ' <UNK> ' ."
"arianna found her thoughts shifting <UNK> ; as she realised , again , that rick had n't written or even ' phoned her for the past month ."
""" maybe he 's found someone else "" , she <UNK> , before <UNK> the <UNK> door shut ."
she was irritated at the <UNK> when the ' phone started to ring .
"she got up slowly , and took her time walking over to answer it ."
her heart <UNK> as she realised who it was .
""" hello , <UNK> , "" she heard rick <UNK> been up to ? "" ."
"she paused for a few moments , trying to contain herself , wanting to sound as <UNK> as possible . """
"not a heck of alot "" , she said , "" ..."
"so , to what do i owe the honour of this ' call ."
"did the postal <UNK> die or something ? "" ."
"she heard a deep chuckle from him , before he said , "" no , no - i 'm in <UNK> - at my folk 's place ."
"but , anyhow - i was wondering if i could meet you on tuesday , in town , before i head back down south"
"... i 'd really like to see you again . """
"he seemed pretty sure of himself , thought arianna ."
"but , she <UNK> , it had been ages since she had seen him ... and"
"arianna did n't seem to mind - her heart felt so full , she thought it might burst ."
she was just so ' thrilled ' that he had finally ' called - and that he wanted to see her .
she could barely contain her excitement as they finished their conversation .
""" hey , rick "" , she said quietly , "" i really missed you , <UNK> . """
"a few moments passed , before he said , "" yeah , i know ."
arianna felt like she wanted to say alot more - her thoughts were <UNK> to tell him how she still felt .
"instead , she managed to <UNK> them , and said ; "" i 'll see you on tuesday , then ."
* arianna was getting impatient for the lecture to finish .
<UNK> <UNK> was going over the <UNK> points of <UNK> development ; his style of presentation wasn’t at all <UNK> .
"she kept looking <UNK> at her watch , in between <UNK> down rough notes in her cell biology lecture book ."
"when the class was finally <UNK> , arianna nearly ran from the lecture theatre : the bus left in only <#> minutes , hence her <UNK> ."
it was a steep climb up the hill from there - but she still made her <UNK> in record time .
"a few minutes later , arianna was standing outside rick ’s front door ."
her fingers <UNK> <UNK> as she reached up for the <UNK> .
"she paused for a few moments , catching her breath , then pressed the button firmly ."
"a few moments later , rick ’s smiling face appeared as he opened the door wide ."
“ my mother ’s still here - would you like to come in for a <UNK> ? ” .
"arianna nodded her <UNK> , then followed him back inside the house ."
"arianna found it increasingly hard to ignore rick , even though he sat at the far end of the table ."
"a <UNK> smile <UNK> across his face , his eyes <UNK> as he watched her <UNK> ."
", rick <UNK> after half an hour or so , “"
i told arianna that i’d take her out to lunch .
"it ’s nearly <UNK> now , so we had really better be going ... ” ."
"he walked up to arianna , pulling out her chair as she stood up . """
"well , it ’s been nice seeing you again , arianna ” , the older woman said <UNK> . “"
i’d better be going soon myself - i’ve got an appointment in town at <#> ” .
"“ it was nice to see you again , too ” , she replied ."
"“ thanks for the tea , mrs <UNK> ” ."
"even as his mother had turned to put the <UNK> on the kitchen bench , rick had gently pulled her by the hand out the hallway door ."
"a few minutes later , arianna and rick were walking back down the hill , not saying very much to each other ."
they then had a brief <UNK> on the <UNK> warm autumn weather ; but arianna got the distinct impression that his thoughts definitely seemed to be elsewhere .
"he said very little ; he kept smiling at her , and it seemed he couldn’t take his eyes off her ."
"” , he asked suddenly , as he moved to put his arm around her waist ."
<UNK> stopped and brought lunch at the local cafe .
"they were now sitting in a <UNK> <UNK> , several <UNK> away from the narrow walking track ."
"so , what have you been up to at <UNK> - met any <UNK> ?"
"rick lowered his eyes for a moment , then shook his head , saying quietly , <UNK> really missed you , <UNK> ” ."
the previously light air of their talking suddenly seemed to shift .
"rick looked up again , a slightly hopeful expression on his face ."
"“ i really have ... ” , he continued <UNK> , “ ... and i know i still love you ” ."
arianna ’s heart skipped a beat : but she didn’t respond .
"he looked at her <UNK> for several seconds , trying to judge what she might be thinking ."
"then , he slowly moved his head forward , until his face was mere inches away from hers ."
i dreamed about being with you again ... ” .
"she lowered her eyes , her heart racing now , her voice stolen by the intense look in his eyes ."
"as her hands came up to <UNK> his waist , he gently <UNK> her chin up to face him , her lips slowly <UNK> as he did so ."
"i want you so much , <UNK> ... please let me make love to you ” ."
"as their lips came together in a <UNK> passionate kiss , and with it the last of arianna ’s <UNK> was <UNK> away ."
they had lost no time in <UNK> in the heat of their passion ; and both had been deeply <UNK> by the time arianna had left his bed .
"they had parted <UNK> , holding each other ’s gaze with a warm smile as they had spoken ; rick had promised her that he would ‘"
call her when he was back in town the following month during mid - term break .
"arianna paused on her walk back to the university campus , and sat for a time on the <UNK> above the mt victoria tunnel ."
"she sat in the long grass , <UNK> watching as the traffic <UNK> and <UNK> on the tunnel entrance road below ."
"and she had known that to the very core of her being , that very afternoon , from the <UNK> moment when their souls had seemed to touch ."
"a genuine ‘ catch <UNK> situation had been created by their stolen time together this afternoon , she admitted to herself now ."
"arianna knew it was unlikely that rick would ever change : he <UNK> his freedom too much , and had come to <UNK> the <UNK> of a traditional relationship ."
"to put it <UNK> , as in a tale her <UNK> aunt had once related to her , he simply wasn’t “ marriage material ” ."
<#> <UNK> his <UNK> would grow and allow them to pursue a more stable <UNK> again ; now she knew it was time to let that false hope go .
"as she finished the final <UNK> , tears <UNK> in her eyes and she <UNK> her lips ."
"quickly reading what she had read , she was surprised by the <UNK> it presented : “"
", arianna re - packed her bag , and made her way to the mouth of the tunnel <UNK> ."
"she glanced back over her shoulder at the houses on the opposite <UNK> , a sense of something having <UNK> shifted inside of her ."
she silently hoped the impending winter wouldn’t be too harsh ...
"have pretty much got the comp fixed now , so can send you an endless stream of emails again , lol ..."
"( i 'm sure you missed 'em , not ) ..."
the doctor told me to get some ice and sit with foot up .
i got a note from the doctor ( for peter ) and an appointment to return in <#> weeks to check my progress .
i was n't supposed to work for that <#> weeks .
i was living paycheck to paycheck at this point .
so i was n't getting enough hours to live on as it was !
good thing about working for a corporation is the benefits .
i applied for short term <UNK> ( <UNK> . )
right away since it takes some time and tons of paperwork .
i was still waiting to hear on that when it was time to go back to the doctor .
"if i had a penny for every time someone asked me "" how did you do this again ?"
""" i would have more <UNK> than i could easily carry around ."
i wish i had a much better story of how this happened .
the problem with it was anyone who knew me would start laughing after my opening sentence .
""" i told you before i 'm a terrible liar . when i went back to the doctor he could n't belief my lack of progress ."
"he asked "" the question "" at least twice and sent me away with a slip to get another x - ray and a <UNK> to an <UNK> surgeon ."
he also gave me another note for peter <UNK> my time off for another month .
he wanted to get me into <UNK> . but felt we needed to do more healing first .
i know you are all wondering so i will just say yes
". each person i saw in the <UNK> of healthcare <UNK> asked "" the question "" in near disbelief ."
the more time that passed it took on a <UNK> quality .
by the time i saw <UNK> doc it had been about a month since that <UNK> day .
he wanted to get me back on both legs and back to work
so he had me <UNK> for a walking cast .
he gave the okay for <UNK> and wanted to see me in a month .
work rejected my walking cast for safety and health code reasons .
i could n't return to work until i could do so without my cast .
lots of phone time and paperwork involved but i 'm thankful i had this .
it did n't pay the amount i was used to but it was something !
my life as i was used to it changed <UNK> from that day forward .
being the independent gal i am suddenly needing to rely on others for simple things was hard .
some can give <UNK> that i would <UNK> on difficult at times .
:) since then i have had to change the way i do things and give up some things i really enjoy .
it 's okay ' cause i 'm still <UNK> just differently .
as i already said i had a blast monday night !
<#> of the reasons was the fact that people seemed to put their personal conflicts aside and came together for the evening .
i know when you have a small diverse group not everybody is going to get along all of the time .
especially when there is a lot of <UNK> in their time together .
i for <#> needed a night of <UNK> with people i enjoy and am i comfortable with .
i know i did n't do the promised song but i had my peter <UNK> on !
not sure at this point what could be new or stronger to add to the <UNK> other than the layer of <UNK> we are getting .
<#> day soon i shall grab that mic and shock you all !
in the meantime i keep <UNK> singing games in shows but would do it if was called for .
i know i promised details of the evening but in remembering a great evening to those who were n't there can sometimes make it sound sorted .
for those who were there nothing that happened was new or different for that gathering .
so i shall just leave it at that i look forward to <#> day doing karaoke in the bay area with mike and <UNK> .
hopefully <#> or both will come back to visit and sing .
i 'm hoping sam will do the same too !
"i try to keep a "" the glass is half full "" perspective on my life ."
i have some heavy decisions to make and deal with right now .
the reason i 'm writing this is to let you know that if i do n't seem my usual positive adorable self not to worry .
what you can do is send positive energy my way .
for some reason ' we ' have to be tested regularly by the entity in charge of the universe .
to really see what we are made of and how much we can handle without being broken .
"well , i 'm still standing and plan to stay that way !"
so be honest but kind to me and i will soon have my stuff worked out .
i will have my boys for <#> weeks starting thursday
"so be patient if my posts are wacky , few , and almost <UNK> ."
we are going to come up with a system of sharing the computer without it turning into a <UNK> .
on march <UNK> <#> at <#> : <#> in the morning i was walking home from work .
it was a beautiful spring day and i was looking forward to a walk through a big park near by for exercise .
i was also taking my camera along in hopes of some cherry <UNK> shots .
work had been uncomfortable but that day i rocked and was in a great mood .
i was going over what i needed to gather to get going .
there were a couple of cars waiting at the stop sign
so i decided to walk a bit closer to my building before i crossed the street .
i was almost across from the front door so i went to cross between <#> cars .
they were parked close together so when i stepped down off the curb i stepped on the edge of a hole i did n't see .
i went down fast and hard . as it was happening
so i tried in my pain amidst a string of <UNK> to <UNK> my items .
<#> attempt to move and i realized <#> of my worst fears had come true .
i have worked hard the last <#> years to be self sufficient .
i have not gone out partying on the night before a early morning ( early is <UNK> ) at work .
but a lot of my co - workers do it <UNK> .
i would resist buying that awesome pair of shoes that i would love to have but did n't need .
i always made sure i had rent and bills covered before all else .
what i 'm saying is there was nobody around to be my back up .
( that 's a whole set of stories i will eventually get to ) i 'm proud of the person i am and <UNK> into .
i have always been and still am a responsible person .
yea for me because i had paid the extra for health insurance .
in the <#> <#> years i worked there i never really needed it .
some co - workers even had said i should cancel it so i would have extra spending money .
i just felt better knowing if i needed it i had it .
the fire <UNK> was coming to do an inspection of the <UNK> system in my building .
he was freaked out watching me go down and putting <UNK> everywhere to shame with my string of <UNK> at a increased volume .
he gathered my items and helped me hop to my building .
once inside i took it from there and got to my apt .
and i had to get my shoe and sock off while i still could .
i had no clue since i never had an emergency !
i had to play corporate phone transfer til <#> lady told me my options .
i spent waiting for jasmine to show up .
so i did n't really know her very well .
she used the spare keys i kept in my locker to get in my place .
she got me <UNK> and cleaned my knee up .
she even helped me change out of my uniform !
she and her husband drove me cross town to my doctors office .
i told them they did n't have to wait for me .
i was being fit in so who knew how long i would be .
"sara , my friend who lived next door , worked over that way and would be getting off about the time i 'd probably be done ."
i 'm so glad i made the trip for karaoke because i had a blast last night !
"the evening was filled with great music , awesome performances , cock blocking , fruit <UNK> drinks , lots of laughter and good old fashion make out sessions ."
you really ca n't ask for more than that in <#> evening !
i will get to a more detailed post later but i have to <UNK> with the boys for the computer so it may be late tonight or tomorrow .
stay tuned to <UNK> 's world if you dare .
so the same friends i do <UNK> with are also serious karaoke folks .
they have play lists and go crazy at a new karaoke venue <UNK> on the song book .
i do n't want to call them karaoke <UNK> but they only do songs they know they can do well and never done in humor .
i 've always thought of karaoke as silly fun .
"do n't get me wrong , they have lots of fun and support each other but it can cause some performance anxiety to a <UNK> ."
i took choir in high school and sounded good with the other second <UNK> .
never in the many months of hanging with these folks have i done a song .
at first it was because i was catching up with people .
i should mention that this happens in eugene not portland .
i think i did turn in a song once late in the evening but it was too late .
"then near the end of the walking cast phase of my recovery ( yes , another story i will get to ! )"
they actually threatened to remove them if i did n't get better !
i could n't sing for awhile then i could do lower notes but not much else .
it was n't funny like the <UNK> bunch episode when the kids formed a music group .
they did it to win money to buy their parents an anniversary present .
<UNK> voice started to change a couple days before the contest so greg re - wrote his hit song to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> voice .
it 's been <#> months and i have more of a range but still not great .
honestly i think it 's <UNK> more that a need to <UNK> !
if we transition into <UNK> and it 's still a problem then i 'll know .
i do n't have the lovely health insurance now so ...
i'll cross that bridge when i have to .
<#> of the gang moved to california late july .
<#> of them has come back for a week to visit mommy and friends .
i hope to make the trip so i can see her at monday night karaoke .
she is entertaining and <UNK> - fun to watch .
they are both missed but she can shake it while <UNK> out a tune .
i might finally do a song such as it will sound . :)
i figure i should explain the title to this blog .
like most things it 's longer than <#> entry so bear with me .
my writing style makes some people cringe but keep reading it might grow on you .
<#> years ago i had to make a hard decision that hurt people i loved .
i had to start my life on my own for the first time .
my support system ( my family ) that i thought would always be there <UNK> .
actually they believed my ( <UNK> now ex ) husband .
this was bizarre since i always tell the truth .
i do n't have it in me to lie and you can tell from my face if i am trying .
the person who had been a great friend stepped in and was my support .
( this is the bigger painful lesson i learned )
"i felt that i was truly in the fight for my life . """
"they "" kept pushing and punching trying to knock me down and out ."
things got tough but no matter what ( you got it ) i was still standing .
i went down on <#> knee more than once but something in me just kept me going .
( btw i used to box thus the fighting <UNK> ) do n't get out any <UNK> because this is n't a sad story .
i have had some tough times sure and i have learned some valuable things along the way .
the most important things i learned is i 'm a strong woman .
more than that i learned to trust and believe in myself and like me .
like any journey you make wrong turns and errors in judgment .
in the coming posts it will all be revealed .
after waiting what seemed years but was really only <#> hours i finally get another turn !
i love my boys dearly but they are computer nazi 's !
:) to be fair they are n't allowed to use the computer at their house but come on ! !
there is so much that wants to come rushing out i do n't know where to start !
how about a glimpse into how i really do enjoy the simple things ?
let me start by giving you a bit of back round .
i really enjoy where i am and it was a block from work .
"the building i live in is a funky old place with big windows , pocket doors and <UNK> foot <UNK> ."
most are single and double <UNK> with <#> <UNK> and a couple <#> <UNK> . thrown in for fun .
i was lucky enough to get <#> of the double <UNK> on the corner so i have cross <UNK> .
mine is also <#> of the few that have n't been <UNK> to make it modern .
it has been <UNK> hot for a week or so making my world uncomfortable .
( i dislike being too hot or cold ) this morning i woke up to slightly over cast skies .
it is cooler and strangely quiet for a saturday .
after i started the coffee i moved the <UNK> bed and got out my outdoor <UNK> chair .
( my oldest son was still asleep on the only place besides the bed to sit ) as i sat down i had a happy feeling .
something about the day and the chair reminded me of camping .
i got a goofy smile on my face and <UNK> in the good feeling .
"well , i 'm not usually <#> to follow the sheep but in this case i did !"
it started out <UNK> enough by getting the site addresses of friends .
i would look at their blogs and journals when i remembered to but i soon found myself <UNK> on just to view their sites .
in fact it got to be a self made frustration !
<UNK> on to view the latest and they did n't even have the courtesy to update !
so i got a user name and started but did n't finish setting up a blog of my own .
i wondered if people would really want to read my positive <UNK> outlook on life and could do so without getting sick ?
"so it sat <UNK> for a few days , really forgotten until , a friend "" <UNK> "" my user name to my "" in name only "" blog ."
the comment that came out of the blue made me feel i was caught .
i gave the lame excuse that i had never made my web page so .... .
""" you should get on that "" okay now i feel i gotta follow through on this since i went that far ."
( for those of you who do n't know me i know just enough about computers to be dangerous . )
it took me most of a day and tons of calories burned from frustration !
the first <#> pages i set up were cool .
the next several were okay and the final product is just what i made to get here .
actually the page is just a page but cute and useful in it 's own right .
that 's all for now as <#> teens are nagging for their ( god given ) right for a turn now !
it 's my second <#> outside my house ( where i <UNK> have stamp camps ) .
luckily i 'm all packed and all i have to do now is wait till <#> pm .
personal note : gotta remember to stop at <UNK> on the way .
"kids are driving me a lil <UNK> today , but right now they 're quiet ."
"just wish i could spend the rest of the day <UNK> out , or screaming at the top of my lungs ."
<UNK> is <UNK> too . which makes me feel guilty .
"i 'm leaving the kids behind while i do my workshop , and he 's <UNK> ."
does he feel guilty when he goes to work everyday ?
i 'm a stay at home mom with lots of hobbies .
"been drawing , painting , <UNK> , and <UNK> for over <#> years now ."
i 've joined the arts guild in my area again .
"i 'm a member , and leader , of a local moms group ."
i plan on joining the <UNK> once my daughter enters school in sept ( <UNK> ) .
"i have a small home business selling rubber <UNK> that 's started out slow , but it 's picking up pretty quickly as i go ."
"i celebrate our holidays and try to teach my little ones open <UNK> , kindness , and respect for all nature and humanity ."
i 'm sure there 's more to me that <UNK> my mind right now .
etc ... a part of me is looking forward to it .
doing the little things that i look over on a daily basis .
a whole day without kids ... sounds too good to be true .
but it 's a day of jury duty ...
"so , i 'm torn as to whether or not this will be good or bad ."
"okay , i need to <UNK> my last <#> days ."
"sunday : party went well , a few too many damn people . but went great sales wise ."
"she puts me thru some hell , and we watch <#> feet under ( wow , claire ! a lesbian ... really ? ) and go to bed ."
watch monster house ( it 's to be continued ... sigh ) .
"i work on some more cards ( a really cool "" 1st day at school card "" , will put in her <UNK> someday ) ."
"<UNK> comes home , cook dinner , eat , sit on computer ."
there ... that 's about the <UNK> of it .
my friend in west bend is <#> <UNK> pregnant !
they 're still going thru with the <UNK> too ... from empty home to full family .
compassion has always been <UNK> to our culture and has been identified as <#> of <#> <UNK> or key defining characteristics of our culture .
"similarly aggression is a <UNK> of the newer , emerging culture ."
<#> bottle of the now premium drink was provided to each <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> family member ) per day for the duration of the near <UNK> condition .
responses to <UNK> the advertising industry at large has <UNK> <UNK> as a revolutionary new strategy that will change the face of advertising for all time to come .
"the stock markets are equally <UNK> about it , indeed hat <UNK> are well into their second day of a strong bull run ."
the social sector has viewed this development with concern .
well known social <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the organization <UNK> known as <UNK> –
"we have always <UNK> against corporate co - option of <UNK> - cultural tools , and are shocked and <UNK> at this blatant corporate <UNK> ."
<UNK> him was our <UNK> <UNK> from new york .
"so without further <UNK> , its over to our special <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> , i <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> along done way ."
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it , <UNK> i <UNK> <UNK> hat <UNK> out <UNK> ."
put <UNK> the en i wicked up <UNK> she <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you <UNK> <UNK> our <UNK> - <UNK> ...
"so <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> any <UNK> to <UNK>"
post of mall to he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> me hand ad <UNK>
a <UNK> lay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> me .
( even <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> ) i <UNK> to <UNK> her <UNK> i <UNK> her .
"<UNK> she <UNK> me , <UNK> <UNK> me way <UNK> <UNK> ."
"truthfully i told , "" i was feeling lucky "" ."
yesterday <UNK> and i were doing stuff around here and he was trying to get stuff done
and i was thinking that i needed to write .
and he wants to go to the beach .
"i was like , "" i do n't really feel like the beach . """
i was a little ill in the stomach area .
"and he 's like "" what about that park near <UNK> ? """
"biking 's okay , but not that far . """
we ended up running <#> short errands and coming back home .
"but before we came home , he said , "" do you want to go somewhere ? """
"i said , "" where is there to go ? """
"he said nothing , we ended up here at home ."
but he never took his shoes off - which he always does .
"and after a few minutes , he says , "" do you want to go to a park ? """
"i said , "" why did n't we go when we were out ? """
"he said , "" i asked you if you wanted to go somewhere ? """
"i said , "" what did i answer ? """
"he said , "" you just said where is there to go ?"
"so i thought you wanted to come home . """
"that was your cue to answer the question . """
"i said , "" i need time to write ."
i 'm not going to have time for a while and i need to finish that piece .
he stayed away for an hour and a half or <#> .
"when he returned , i was finished and pumped up ."
i really think he needs to learn that that 's a good investment of his time .
leave me alone to wrote and i 'll fuck you 're brains out later .
i could tell for the past few days that <UNK> has wanted sex .
"he was on me suddenly , kissing and stuff ."
"i was kissing him back , but i was clearly giving him the "" no , this is not going to happen "" signal ."
the next morning i had a pain in my neck and back and then last night it was like 1:00 before we got to bed .
"so this morning , i thought it was about time - and i was looking forward to sex too - so i <UNK> it ."
<#> of the great things about our relationship is that the sex is great .
"i wo n't go into details , but it 's quite nice ."
its ' like <#> time out of <#> that it 's not great .
he just laid there and sort of waited for things to happen .
i got the message and made quick work of it .
that <UNK> 's taken care of for now .
i can tell he 's sort of pissy still .
we ran errands today and he 's been sort of cold .
and i know that what i need to do right now is extend myself and ask what 's up and all that .
i feel like he should step the fuck up and say something .
i 'm glad our second week of vacation is over and i can have some time to myself .
when i suggested the other day that he go out alone so i could have some time alone
"for an evening , it was like i had said i did n't like him any more ."
i do n't want to hammer on him all the time .
i 've been with a lot and i know he 's a keeper .
and <#> % of the time he 's loving a fun .
he 's just going through a little time right now .
fortunately he knows he needs to let me write here .
but i asked him several times before and he always has some dumbass answer .
"<#> time when we were on a trip with some friends , he was a pissy and i asked later , "" what 's up ? """
"he said , with a sigh , "" i saw you looking at that guy at the airport ."
""" i was like , "" what ? "" he said , "" when we were all sitting there . """
"he said , "" do n't pretend you do n't know ."
"the skinny guy with the short hair . and another time you were looking at an old guy pushing a wheel chair . """
""" he said , "" you were obviously trying to make eye contact . """
"and why would i be flirting with some old guy pushing a wheel chair . """
"i said , "" <UNK> , i look at people ."
and i do n't do this jealousy thing .
after that he got all boo - hoo and apologized .
"later i said , "" if you 're pissed off at me , say somthing ."
i ca n't be the <#> to constantly be <UNK> your feelings .
"until then , i know how to act oblivious ."
but it 's like some bell goes off and suddenly i know that i 've done something .
"its ' like a silent , invisible shield comes down and i can tell he 's left ."
"in the big picture , i think , if this is the worst of it , i can take it ."
the other day a friend told me about blogging .
i thought i would give it a look .
i found some of them interesting and i thought i would give it a try .
"mostly , tho , i need a place to vent some of my frustrations about my wonderful ( possibly , soon to be ) husband , <UNK> ."
"i would talk to my mother or friends about the frustrations i am having , but i do n't want to get a lot of """
"i told you so "" and if there 's <#> thing my mother loves , it 's that fucking phrase ."
i told you not to move over there .
i totally love it here - we live in <UNK> .
i 've been here about a year and i 'm getting my <UNK> .
"but <UNK> has some habits and ways that i find a little difficult to handle some times , and that 's what this is about ."
plus i do n't need to be reminded about something i complained about over and over .
i can put it here and let it rest .
"so if no <#> ever reads this , i do n't really care ."
"and if everyone reads it , i do n't mind that either ."
i just need a place to <UNK> and tell about those things that piss me off .
and there are some things that he does that are so <UNK> sweet i think i 'll just throw up - and i love them .
it 's been like <#> days since he left .
it 'll be another week until he 's back .
strange to be alone in the house for so long .
"i keep busy , but i do n't particularly like spending every single night alone ."
it 's a little lonely and <UNK> 's fun to be around .
"problem is he talks so softly because he 's in an office full of people , and he 's never been very loud on the phone ."
"i walk through and i think , "" <UNK> would go nuts with this . """
i knew it was bad when i walked past a pair of <UNK> on the dining room floor .
"there are clothes all over the living room , dishes in the sink , laundry that needs to be folded , the bed 's <UNK> ."
i have to do a major cleaning on saturday .
i know he would really not like it .
"it sort of scares me when i sit here , having smoked , and get paranoid ."
"but i have to keep saying , "" you have until saturday to smoke - maybe sunday ."
""" he would n't come home early ."
and it 's not like there 's smoke all over the house .
it 's just that i 'm thinking about it .
i wonder sometimes if i 'm being good enough to him .
i try to let him know all the time that i love him and that i want to be with him .
i think he 's a little <UNK> that i wo n't be staying .
"it 's kind of crazy thinking , but then it makes me wonder what kind of partner i 'm being ."
i so do n't want to start taking him for granted .
i think that 's a total death to a relationship .
"i 'm a <#> year old , no kids , well <UNK> , american woman ."
i 'm so not living a normal life .
i want to live somewhere fabulous and have a nice relationship and a normal life .
i want to write and do work that i love and think it great .
and i think i 'm well on the way to getting that .
<UNK> is such a wonderful man and so very loving .
"and he challenges me in a lot of ways , good ways ."
i hate to think i could lose him .
thing is i know that all he really wants is to be loved . and that he enjoys being loved by me .
i think we 're a really good match .
"<UNK> had asked him to drop by , as he was concerned about me being alone and not having anyone to talk to ."
sweet thing trying to take care of me even from far away .
"got stoned and talked to my sister , katie , last night for a while ."
she 's having some stupid affair with a cop in oklahoma .
the guy 's wife found out and the guy has n't called in a few days .
i was nothing if not completely brilliant in my responses to her .
"i was like , it 's okay to screw up and fall down , but at some point you have to get up and move on ."
she just loves to hang on to shit .
now they 're full of shit ! had coffee with a new friend yesterday .
at least i hope she 's a new friend .
sort of in the same situation as me with the dutch partner and all .
again there was a marriage proposal and a pause and then an open invitation .
"found out from the friend , the first mentioned here , that <UNK> thinks i 've had a pretty adventurous life up to now - and he 's right ."
<UNK> has n't been as ... adventurous as me .
grab the fuckin ' bull by the fuckin ' horns .
go after it - and look good doin ' it .
<UNK> finally got out of the apartment yesterday .
i was really sad to see him go .
he finally called from the airport - as i had encouraged him to - and we talked for a bit .
"but <UNK> , being dutch , does n't smoke ."
you 're average real <UNK> does n't smoke weed .
"i know i do n't need to smoke , so i do n't ."
but <#> of the great things about <UNK> going out of town is that i can smoke .
i have n't smoked since i moved here .
"i 've had a piece of space cake , but i have n't actually smoked ."
"had i known how much a <UNK> is , i would n't have bought so much ."
it was <#> euro per <UNK> and <#> - <#> euro for <#> .
"<#> would have done me , but i was a little embarrassed at being such a <UNK> ."
"the guy was totally cool , very matter of fact , irish , i think . there was an american chick there ."
the guy who sold it to me was the dealer .
"i chose mother 's delight because there was no "" <UNK> <UNK> . """
"i did n't want to ask about it for fear that the guy would say , "" that 's a <UNK> , dumb bitch . """
i 'd been warned by a woman at church to not smoke the whole thing down as that could totally have put me on the floor for the evening .
"strange to smoke a <UNK> in this house , although i kept blowing the smoke outside ."
had a strange vision of <UNK> coming home suddenly because of some airplane difficulty .
"i watched "" <UNK> <UNK> , "" the movie ."
i 'd seen it years ago with a boyfriend .
"it was a bit tedious , sweet , but tedious ."
and then it made me miss <UNK> and feel bad that i 've been a less than <UNK> girlfriend to him at times recently .
the vegetables i made for dinner were way too spicy .
i threw in a pepper and then threw in another .
then i absent <UNK> scratched the inside of my nose .
"when the movie was over , i sat and wrote for almost <#> hours ."
"i 'm not sure if any of it 's good , but it was too fun to stop ."
a <UNK> would be <UNK> at every chance .
"i realize it 's been hours . and delighted at what i 've written , delighted at the process ."
my latest <UNK> is something about all the guys i 've been with .
"she had <#> and said , "" i 'm so embarrassed ."
"i ca n't remember kenny 's last name . """
"and i knew that if i started there , i was not going to be able to finish ."
so i started a list several days later . and
every once in a while i still add to it when i think of another guy .
""" that guy with the red shirt and eye <UNK> in <UNK> . "" ca n't remember kenny 's last name ?"
ca n't remember why the name <UNK> sounds familiar and is linked with the smell of <UNK> powder !
"a little depressing with some , but interesting ."
i do n't have to worry about <UNK> as it might never get published .
but i wanted a <UNK> of who i 'd done it with .
"i also want to start another list of "" who i did n't have sex with . """
"ones i got close to doing it with , but did n't . would also be interesting ."
<UNK> is about to go out of town for like <#> days .
he 's been packing and doing things all day in preparation .
he 's been so quiet that it made me feel like i 'd done something .
"he looked at me and said , "" you have n't done anything . """
like it was the most obvious thing in the world .
"i said , "" i never know . """
"it sort of bothers me , but it 's just the way he is ."
he 's quiet and he needs to spend time thinking about what he 's packed and what he has n't .
and i know he wants to have sex before he leaves for the airport .
"so i said , "" i 'm going to go take a shower and then maybe a nap . """
this has been a good signal in the past that i am going to ready myself for sex .
"i do n't mind wake up and fuck sex - in fact i like it a lot - but not if we 're dirty , and we were ."
it was about <#> in the afternoon and neither of us had showered yet - or even brushed our teeth .
"i think he wanted to get it going , or he expected me to , but he 's sort of sticky and his breath <UNK> ."
"i thought , man , i 'd love to do you right now , but you stink ."
but i ca n't tell him that or he 'll get offended .
i 'll survive without sex for that long .
"i know he 's nuts about me , but the last <#> days , i 've wanted to kick him out of bed ."
"our morning ritual is to wake up , with the alarm , and <#> of us says , "" coffee ? """
and i 'm like totally <UNK> for a cup of coffee .
"finally i say , "" coffee "" or get up and get it myself , as i did yesterday ."
i am <#> of the <UNK> bitches on the planet and it seems like all i can do is <UNK> about a man that just loves me to pieces .
"when he <UNK> me when i am speaking dutch , i just say , "" okay , thanks . "" but"
"this morning , i was like "" dude , it 's time for some joe ! """
<UNK> had to go out of town yesterday and wo n't be back until this morning .
i 've been <UNK> off of <UNK> pretty steadily for a while .
this combo turned out to be not so nice yesterday .
"in my <UNK> towards the end of the day , i decided to have a cup of tea and a few cookies ."
"then when i went to bed , my body would not turn off ."
it was <UNK> not having <UNK> in bed next to me and i could n't go to sleep .
it did n't occur to me until this morning that it might have been the extra <UNK> .
"i always think time away is going to be nice , but i find myself lonely at the end of the day ."
"i 've had enough relationships to last me if things with <UNK> do n't work out or if he should , god forbid , die ."
i do n't think i 'd want another relationship .
and i 'd sort of like him to be my last big love .
i 've been the last big love for <#> men .
"it 's an honor , in a very <UNK> , sad way ."
it would give me more time to write .
i feel like my love <UNK> has been filled .
i made a list of men i 've been with and <UNK> ... enough .
"not all "" loves "" with a capital l , but enough sex and enough strong feelings ."
i miss <UNK> and i look forward to him being here tonight .
"i said , "" is there something wrong ? """
he <UNK> something about me being married to the computer .
"i started to deny it , but then i realized that he 's right ."
"i spend quite a bit of time on the computer , and he felt hurt , pushed out of my life ."
"turns out that when he left saturday , it was n't a good thing ."
"he felt like he was being pushed out of the house - and , really , he sort of was ."
"but i ca n't get sucked into the <UNK> that "" that black box "" ( his reference to my computer ) is ."
i really realized that i was wrong and that i needed to admit it and ' <UNK> up .
"my initial reaction is to deny , deny , deny ."
eleven years of therapy put to good use .
"however , not checking my e - mail before going to bed was hard !"
"i love him , but i know that without him , my life is in a very <UNK> position ."
"i hate to make decisions based on that , but it 's true and i have to factor it in ."
"that said , i did n't apologise because i was afraid ( as i hate making decisions based on fear ) but because i knew i was wrong ."
"at bedtime , of course we had sex . and"
this morning i stayed in bed and he was just a <UNK> puppy .
he just wants me to love him and be true to him .
he had a pretty bad experience before and he needs <UNK> .
"i had some bad experiences , but i handled them in different ways ."
"hence , i feel like i have more shell than him ."
i got out of bed this morning at <UNK> .
then i got an e - mail that said my computer might have a virus and that i should download this file .
"i was born at night , but it was n't last night ."
"i deleted the e - mail , but decided to run a virus check , which involved updating my virus software ."
"a little while later , i noticed <UNK> moving around ."
"he seemed a little quiet , but that kind of quiet where i know that he is being extra quiet on purpose ."
"and i thought , what the hell did i do now ?"
later on i realized that i 'd gotten out of bed and started moving around .
"when i first moved , we would lay in bed and talk for a while every morning , and especially at the beginning we had sex like every morning ."
he has the kind of job where he can go in when he <UNK> .
he likes me to lay there and he likes to try to get something going .
"i , on the other hand , am an early <UNK> ."
"before i moved here , i used to get up at 6:00 , just to be up and do things ."
i would sleep in until 8:00 and it felt <UNK> .
<UNK> does n't even stir on a normal day until 8:00 and he 'll sleep until 10:00 .
half the fuckin ' day is over by then !
so i realized he 's pissy because i have n't laid in bed and <UNK> for a few days .
i like sitting alone and having a cup of coffee .
"if it 's <UNK> and he 's laying on top of me trying to put his tongue in my mouth , i tend to get a little impatient ."
"so i have to do a little <UNK> today and stroke his ego , among other things ."
"it may not sound like it , but i looked at him the other day and my heart <UNK> ."
"he <UNK> when i say , this is how i am ."
but he does n't always like the reality when i am the way i am .
"i said , this is how i am ."
"please take the time to review the forms of urllink "" mere rhetoric "" in order to be better prepared to help bring reason to light ."
where do i begin to draw a picture of the world ?
where do i begin to draw a picture of the world accurately and honestly ?
"after all , without a beginning , nothing can follow ."
but it is also partly a hope that enough of us have sufficient <UNK> and courage to try to make a difference .
"and i look forward to friday because , frankly , we hate our jobs ."
"every friday we go out to eat ( think <UNK> - <UNK> - a , not <UNK> factory ) and see the newest movie ."
"this friday we saw m. night <UNK> 's "" the village "" ."
i had already notice that <UNK> had given the movie only <#> star .
"still , i was fully prepared to be disappointed ."
i happen to like <UNK> phoenix and i will see pretty much anything he is in .
maybe my body is n't used to anything green .
i felt like i had eaten a brick and it was stuck at the top of my stomach .
"then , we drove across the freeway to the <UNK> 's movie theatre ."
"this movie theatre has to be <UNK> <UNK> old and believe me , it could use a make - over ."
"but , it 's better than going to the <UNK> and waiting in line an hour ."
"every time we go , we know our butts are going to start hurting before the coming <UNK> are over ."
<#> thing that bothered me last night was that the movie theatre was full of teenagers that laughed and talked through the movie .
"not <UNK> happened but it was beautifully shot , the actors were top - notch and it was interesting ."
"yeah , a few of the lines were ridiculous ."
"i suppose if you were expecting a terror filled movie , you would have been disappointed ."
but i realized that <UNK> 's movies are never really like that .
"some of the kids were yelling "" it sucked "" but"
after the movie we drove to starbucks and purchased <#> <UNK> - sized vanilla bean <UNK> 's .
we are n't into coffee but damn if those <UNK> 's are n't heaven on earth ! ! ! !
"so as the title reads , i 'm pretty much new to this blog thing ."
"well , i just got back from watching <UNK> and <UNK> go to white castle ."
the <UNK> looked promising and i have to say that the film turned out to be pretty entertaining .
a little ridiculous at times but overall very funny .
the trip to and <UNK> the movie theatre was a mess .
it was pouring cats and dogs and it made for some <UNK> driving <UNK> .
i was relieved to get back home in <#> piece .
before heading out i managed to complete an <UNK> image and i uploaded it to the <UNK> yahoo !
"for those not familiar with ap or ar , ap stands for age <UNK> and ar stands for age <UNK> ."
i have a talent for <UNK> photos with my <UNK> computer and photoshop .
i find ar a little more difficult than ap but that could just be because i 'm not comfortable with it yet .
my most recent <UNK> image is of actress <UNK> <UNK> and her mother .
<#> of the members of the <UNK> group had posted a <UNK> picture of <UNK> and her mother walking side by side .
the member who posted it suggested that it kind of looked like someone had <UNK> <UNK> the mom from young to old .
i liked the idea of the challenge of age - <UNK> her mom since i had tried age - <UNK> a person 's picture only once before .
to see a sample of what i came up with urllink click here .
so why did i post the image to the <UNK> group ?
i 've been a member of it for about a year now .
it 's a place for the posting of pictures and stories
whose primary plot is that of female age <UNK> .
"this could be young girls to adult women or older , young women to old women , or female children to adults ."
i prefer stories and images of the young or adult women to old women .
i 've created and posted quite a few images that feature <UNK> versions of female celebrities .
the other members get a kick out of that .
"although , i take it too far for some of them ."
i have a tendency to age women into their <#> 's or <#> 's .
those members wish that i had stopped <UNK> <#> .
"in any case , i 'm just fascinated by the process of <UNK> ."
"if there 's a psychology major out there who might be able to shed some light on this , i 'd be greatly <UNK> ."
"and i find the aging process , the transformation from young to old , fascinating ."
"well , i guess i 'll end my 2nd post here ."
if you 're interested in checking out the <UNK> group urllink click here .
i also post to another group called urllink <UNK> .
i 've always considered posting my thoughts and some of my everyday happenings to a blog and here it is !
"right now , i 'm at work so this is going to be very brief ."
"i went and took my <UNK> drug test , got my background check paperwork in etc ."
the only downside is that if i leave the ' company ' within <#> months i will have to <UNK> the sign on bonus ... what if i die ?
"anyway , i still ca nt decide if i am excited or stressed at this point . '"
"they ' want me to start on sept <#> , that does n't give me much time to make sure all my bases are covered here ."
he is not the most computer <UNK> person .
and we had our acceptable use policy meeting today as well
", i will probably get fired for writing in my blog right now ... meh ."
i know its not that bad in comparison to certain other people who pull <UNK> ... heh .
"but still , that 's a long day for me considering all my other responsibilities ."
and it does n't look like i am going to be able to take an extra day or <#> off between jobs .
"i am def an order type of gal , i need order , i deal with enough chaos in my own mind i do n't need any more elsewhere ."
"the price of oil is up , that 's a good thing ."
i was watching cnn while i waited to be called for my test ... gasp ...
but anyway they were talking about this stock <UNK> in which you get this message on your machine <UNK> you of some stock secret
of course i am smart enough not to fall for such obvious <UNK> but still i thought it was kind of funny .
"i wonder what would have happened if i had answered the phone , since this <UNK> is about leaving a supposed wrong number message ..."
i am so tired of <UNK> people i could torch the next <#> .
i mean when i was in school all we needed was some paper and a pencil .
"i do have <#> believe it on not , well maybe just a rant , but still , <UNK> ho ."
so i went to office max last night and all i had was my <UNK> with me in the way of funds etc .
"so we go in with this monster list in hand and the first thing i do is ask the clerk if they take checks , she says yes in her"
oh so <UNK> hood - like southern way ...
so i did n't have time to go home and change first .
"anyway , so we spend the next nearly <#> hours shopping for this stuff , get everything together and head to <UNK> ."
and i pull out my <UNK> and proceed to write a check .
""" oh i m sorry ' <UNK> we ca nt take no checks . """
its the first damned thing i asked when i walked into the place ...
""" oh our here machines have been down and we ca nt take no <UNK> wait ..."
""" "" <UNK> uh girl you know our machines be down . """
i made the leap of faith this morning and gave lil j <#> bucks to buy some stuff at the school store ...
i wonder if she will actually come home with any .
its silly that they give you this monster list and expect you to have it in <#> hours .
"what , is like every mother there a stay at home mom with nothing better to do than go school supply shopping ?"
"i guess i better get off the computer now , i have used up almost <#> minutes and since i know they are def counting now ...."
"i did n't get my offer letter yet , perhaps it will be in the box when i get home tonight ."
plus i have a bunch of filing i have been putting off that now i have to do .
* maybe just a touch of it somewhere ... i need orange ! :d
"i am getting excited , and anxious at the same time ."
i really did try to get up at <#> this morning and i just could n't do it .
she is going to be <#> tired puppy .
"so as it turns out , my ' references ' love me enough to provide some serious <UNK> ."
it was very nice of them and i will have to send them something cool once i start at the other company as a show of gratitude .
so he was afraid to tell me that they had called because he thought he had seriously <UNK> it for me .
he was happy to learn that was not the case .
well i suppose i should actually do some work ... <UNK> up and stuff .
"ok so i finally decided to do what i said i would do , <UNK> up my pages to match the <UNK> <UNK> in my grey matter ."
for now though i enjoy <UNK> with the code and making it my own .
its a good vehicle really for learning what i will need to know in the long run .
"so there you have it , the <#> sides of the coin ."
"urllink <UNK> , <UNK> .... these are few of my favorite things ."
believe it or not the remote control classroom is here .
what could be a more natural match - remote controls and kids .
"urllink as haunting as it still is , the <#> horror still <UNK> in the minds of canadians as well as americans ."
the following report is over <#> pages of <UNK> that may help piece together the truth of what really happened on that tragic day .
urllink i think it is safe to say that i am a mac geek .
"i should be in <#> of those "" ..i switched to <UNK> "" commercials ."
eleven years of system admin duties with windows would make anybody switch .
anybody who is getting use to <UNK> should visit <UNK> dodge 's site ( <UNK> ) .
dodge continues to <UNK> the way for <UNK> in educational technology .
his blog 's help piece together how technology can <UNK> learning .
"this is the last day of summer , we start <UNK> season usually in august ."
"means lots of humidity , hardly any will hit the ground , and we could use it ."
we still have lots to finish up since building the <UNK> on our house .
got to get a well house up before it gets to cold . working out in the yard in august and september
"reminds me of when i was a kid and spent my summers in <UNK> with an aunt , working in her <UNK> fields ."
"we almost have the <UNK> finished , maybe by next weekend we 'll be done ."
"i 've got to trim back my <UNK> <UNK> , it went <UNK> wild this year ."
"but on <#> of my daily <UNK> , i noticed that the <UNK> were there but the grapes were not ?"
"i know nothing about grapes , guess i 'll learn ."
we want to plant some more trees next spring .
i want to plant some veggies and <UNK> as well .
"so much i want to do , and so little time ."
we plan on walking the area tomorrow to look for it .
"everyone out here has dogs and other pets , our <UNK> got bit by <#> last fall ."
he still has <#> patches of no fur on him .
urllink view out my <UNK> after a summer rain - <#> posted by urllink hello
urllink ginger and the <UNK> - mo as i call her .
"there is a first time for everything and this is my first time for blogging , so what shall i say ?"
we have a small oasis that we enjoy calling home .
"john and i thought it was pretty cool , it was mostly <UNK> ."
"big bowl of it , sitting right on top of us last night ."
"we shut down all the computers , <UNK> everything , turned off the lights and enjoyed the light show playing outside , it was wonderful ."
then it rain real good most of the night .
"i really like living way out here , away from everyone and everything ."
"when i got up at 6:30 and <UNK> my computer in , the secondary <UNK> started making this <UNK> noise , had to <UNK> it from the <UNK> ."
"it was causing my computer to <UNK> , was n't loading windows , just <UNK> over and over again ."
but i got it fixed or i would n't be updating my blog .
"i think computers are cool , i 'm always learning something ."
and there is always something worth seeing or hearing on the <UNK> .
"well back to work in the yard , i 'll write more later ."
i needed a place to say a few things .
perhaps it will make some sense once i get <UNK> up to this ?
i noticed him saying a few things that did n't make any sense .
it reminded me of how my mother spoke after she had a stroke .
"i swear i heard him say ; "" <UNK> and <UNK> ..."
"i think he was going to say ; "" members of congress ? "" i see that others caught that "" hair pollution comment , too ."
i thought i was going to fall over when i heard that <#> .
"i mean , i can understand the pressure of this "" most important speech of kerry 's political career , "" but ..."
"maybe <UNK> of spending <#> minutes a day writing it , it should have spent <#> extra minutes a day reading it aloud to an audience ."
"he could , at least , have read to him/her ?"
what is going on with this ... missing out on mentioning kerry 's ex - wife and how he <UNK> that marriage ? !
i do n't even consider myself more than a moderate sort of person and this even <UNK>
it says how he was a <UNK> in congress ... then all of a sudden ...

"yeah , someone has to write about this , do n't they ?"
the cat population in my home changes all the time .
"i promised myself and everyone who knows me that i would never let it get out of control and certainly never become a "" cat lady ."
""" you know the type i 'm talking about ."
the most cats i 've had here is <#> .
"currently , i have <#> cats and <#> "" foster "" cats ."
my house is large enough so everyone has a place they can call their own .
"of course , having so many cats does have it 's share of problems ."
it 's time consuming to feed and clean litter <UNK> .
sharing a queen - sized bed with my boyfriend gets difficult when <#> or more of the cats want to sleep with us .
i ca n't count the <UNK> i 've gotten from sleeping in weird positions so as to not roll over onto them .
"<UNK> is nice to wake up and see them all knocked out and happy , some even laying on their back with their <UNK> up in the air ."
"fortunately , i work from home so that gives me time to play with them and groom them daily ."
"that said , just how much time can <#> devote to a cat when there is work to be done ?"
what happens if <#> of them does n't get enough attention or <#> of them does n't like the other ?
there are times when i feel like i have a house full of <UNK> olds who refuse to get along or behave for even a short period of time .
"i do my best not to play favorites , but my patience is challenged when it always seems to be the same few cats <UNK> ."
things have been relatively fine here until about a month ago when i started to discover cat piss in a few areas around the house .
once it starts it 's tough to get it to stop .
i know this since it happened a few years ago and it was a nightmare .
this is even <UNK> i have no sure idea as to who it is or if it is more than <#> of the cats .
• on my cute stuffed <UNK> toy • on a folder full of my tax <UNK> from <#> ! •
against my <#> 's <UNK> radio ... and the winner ... • on the edge of a guitar case ...
the pee <UNK> into the case and onto a <UNK> guitar ! ! ! !
"yes , i do know that <UNK> can be a sign of illness and <#> of the cats was sick ."
this just ca n't be a sick kitty since none of them are crying or showing other symptoms of illness .
"this is a , literally , pissed off cat ."
"honestly , i thought i had a brain <UNK> for awhile ."
"i had "" this smell "" stuck in my nose everywhere i went ."
my boyfriend has bad <UNK> so he ca n't smell anything .
"whatever i did , i kept noticing this <UNK> ."
i did n't think it was cat pee because i thought i had found all of it !
i even bought a black light so i could locate the pee more easily .
did you know black light makes the pee <UNK> ?
i got really awesome <UNK> <UNK> for the piss ...
that seems to <UNK> the cats are not going to stop .
"if i was really smart , i would also get my butt on the <UNK> and do some urllink <UNK> meditation ."
wish me luck . back to piss patrol .

file under : too weird to be true .
we were friends before and after we hooked <UNK> up .
the fact that we did remain good friends was very cool .
we both dated other people and for awhile everything was fine .
i was even helpful when his relationship came to a sad close .
"i was his ear , his confident , his buddy ."
i made up cool images for him to use on his new personal ad ( when he was ready to start looking again ) .
i even <UNK> with him on who might be a good choice to <UNK> . then
"she is smart , funny , independent , a good mom ."
"he said "" no <#> more than a few miles away from where i live ."
i expect wedding bells already and it 's only been <#> months .
he pretty much stopped talking to me about personal things .
", he was busy with work , but i was there for the bad times and now ..."
well i just started to feel poverty <UNK> and lonely .
were they having more fun than when we dated ?
i got to see pictures of them - a small peek through the door of their life together .
i would see comments about cool furniture that my ex had in his apt ... but did he ever tell anyone i picked it all out ?
then i went away on a buddhist retreat for <#> weeks .
"part of what i learned while away was to focus on "" being "" with <UNK> and be willing to just feel uncomfortable ."
"the other part was to work on being open , instead of closed - off , closed - minded ."
i realized that the loss i felt was certainly natural since all things are in a constant state of change and change can feel painful .
"i also realized that instead of focusing on what i no longer had , i should take a better look around at my own life ."
"i saw my relationship with a great man , who i have become <UNK> intimate with ."
"the problem was simply just learning to accept change , be open to what comes of it and stop being afraid ..."
"he says ; "" would you like to meet k. ? "" before i can answer ... there we are , chatting away ."
i just went with it and i found things that really should not have surprised me .
she is just as smart and capable and funny as i had guessed .
i could have shut down and pushed this entire situation away .
"no , do n't think she 's being <UNK> . not ."
"see , that 's what comes of not <UNK> to the outcome , not being afraid ."
once you let go of all that <UNK> shit there 's freedom .
"[ by the way , i do have to mention that k. also has extremely huge "" nuts "" for being willing to chat with me , too ."
i have a friend who has a friend ...
his friend is a christian of the <UNK> variety .
"he , the atheist , and she , the christian , appear to have a close , loving friendship ."
i once asked my friend if his friend ever <UNK> to him .
"he said , "" no , she respects me to much to do that . """
"this answer , while it did n't surprise me , still <UNK> me ."
"my wife , who was with us for this conversation , agreed with my friend : his friend was being respectful by not preaching her religion to him ."
they agreed with me that it would n't be .
they even agreed that she would be <UNK> as a friend to just let him destroy himself that way .
so why did n't they make the same move with his eternal soul that they made with his mortal life ?
i do n't worry for my atheist friend 's immortal soul .
i 'm not a believer in christ or <UNK> or any version of an <UNK> -- i do n't believe in immortal souls .
i 'm closer to my friend 's <UNK> than i am to his friend 's christian <UNK> .
but that 's beside the point . if she believes in hell
", then i would want her to try to keep her friends and loved ones out of the place ."
i also do n't think she 'd be right to <UNK> him about his sexual practices if his ( <UNK> ) <UNK> behavior were at issue .
i 'm not <UNK> nagging in either case .
but why do non - believers have such a hard time taking seriously the beliefs of the believers ?
( hint : it 's not out of respect ! )
"while i 'm at it , i 'll also throw in a <UNK> ) 's advice on how christians can <UNK> preach to <UNK> ."
urllink ( urllink click to <UNK> . ) ( urllink click to see all . )
"game rules politics is a <#> - sum game : for anything won , there must be something lost ."
"the market ( i.e. , <UNK> exchange ) is a positive - sum game : every <UNK> player wins ."
there seem to be <#> distinct approaches to taking a position .
"i sometimes call these the <#> ' p 's -- principle , practical , <UNK> -- and sometimes the <#> ' e 's -- ethics , economics , emotions ."
the first - <UNK> approach is for those of us who believe the ends ca n't justify the means .
"the second - <UNK> approach is for people who not only say that they are results - oriented , but who actually mean it !"
the third - <UNK> is for everyone else -- it is the realm of both the a- rational and the irrational .
"for almost anyone i 've ever talked to , the ends justify the means ! as <UNK> ."
"the third - <UNK> is where most people really choose their positions , but i do n't have the strength to address that here and now ."
"i 've written a piece on the <#> ' e 's of the minimum wage , and i will post a link when and if i get it published ."
the pattern behind what gets better and what gets worse over time .
"urllink do n't vote , by <UNK> <UNK> ."
so - called urllink liberals ( left - wing social democrats ) are naive to think you can have a welfare state without the warfare state .
"once upon a time , i had a friend who dreaded freedom ."
"like a multiple choice test with only a , b , c , and d to choose from ."
somewhere or other i 've claimed that <#> 's understanding of minimum wage law is a good <UNK> test for economic ( <UNK> .
here i will claim that the belief that we can have a welfare state without the warfare state is a a sure sign of political <UNK> .

"urllink i received the following article in my email today , sent by the author , andrew <UNK> :"
our network provider pulled the plug without warning .
my colleague is trying to find a place to move our host machines .
meanwhile i 've moved the <UNK> domain over here and have <UNK> the blog -- but the images are still on the old server ...
( my father 's websites ) are on that box .
the website of my favorite left - <UNK> <UNK> -- is on that box .
here 's the letter i just wrote the interested parties : what terrible timing .
<UNK> and i just moved from virginia to pennsylvania on sunday .
"either monday night or tuesday morning , my former business partner ( ac ) and i lost access to all our host machines ."
"last night he informed me that our network provider has moved to washington , dc -- without warning us !"
"so the machines are fine , but they have no internet access ."
he has paying customers whose sites are now down !
"if we find space , you 're welcome to continue to keep your sites with me , but i 'll also understand if you choose not to ."
i often quote myself ; it adds spice to my conversation .
"george <UNK> <UNK> cold sober , i find myself absolutely fascinating ."
"everyone can see that , no matter what their rhetoric ."
but the evil has been in the politics and not in the <UNK> .
"without understanding that , the vast majority look to politics for the solution , for the weapon they believe they need to fight <UNK> ."
"<UNK> civilization has <#> children : the market , and the state ."
"almost everything good about civilization seems to have come out of the market , out of <UNK> systems of <UNK> exchange ."
"almost everything bad about civilization seems to have come out of the state , out of the organized use and threat of violence ."
"urllink true <UNK> is both far more reasonable and far more radical for it <UNK> the very existence of such a thing as "" group rights "" ."
"according to <UNK> , no <#> 's rights ever <UNK> anyone else 's rights because all urllink rights are equal and compatible ."
the bank of the united states was established in philadelphia in <#> .
by the 20th century the bank was <#> of the most important in the country .
in <#> <UNK> began to <UNK> that the bank was in trouble .
on the 7th december long <UNK> began forming outside the bank 's branches .
over the next <#> days <UNK> took out $ <#> <#> from the bank .
"on the 11th december , all its branches closed , as the bank no longer had any money to give back to its customers ."
it was the most <UNK> failure in the banking history of the united states .
i received the following feedback on my urllink <UNK> minimum wage urllink article .
"<UNK> <UNK> , i enjoyed reading your article about the minimum wage in <UNK> 's <UNK> edition ."
"while discussing the minimum wage laws with people , i have found that including an example is an excellent way to get the point across ."
here is the <#> that i use : suppose that i own a company that ships boxes of goods . within my company
", i have a group of employees who physically pack the boxes ."
"based on the cost that i charge my customers , i have determined that i can pay $ <#> per box packed ."
some of my employees pack very fast ( say <#> per hour ) so i pay them more than others who can only pack <#> per hour .
"when a new employee starts , he might only be able to pack <#> per hour ."
"as he gains experience , he will become a better worker and might eventually become <#> of my <#> per hour employees ."
but here 's where the minimum wage laws come into effect .
"if the minimum wage is raised to $ <#> per hour , should i pay my <#> box per hour more than the work he has provided for me ?"
would that be a good business decision ? or am i better off only hiring people who can pack at least <#> boxes per hour ?
what happens when the minimum wage is <UNK> to $ <#> per hour ?
it would be in my best interest to clear my staff of anyone packing less than <#> boxes per hour .
", he will never be given the opportunity to increase his skill and get paid well above the minimum wage ."
"instead of earning $ <#> per hour and being a productive member of society , my former employee is now unemployed ."
"unfortunately , even this simple example requires a basic level of business literacy that i 'm afraid too few people seem to grasp ."
even cubicle workers in a large enough corporate <UNK> are divorced from the basic issues of <UNK> .
"money has become so <UNK> for them that it becomes an <UNK> form of symbol <UNK> , no longer grounded to the creation of goods and services ."
economic <UNK> is therefore in the interest of the ruling classes .
i have a once - shattered hip now being held together by plates and screws .
i 'm told that i will eventually need at least <#> hip replacement .
so this aspect of <UNK> medicine strikes a personal <UNK> with me .

"we are moving this week , which makes it hard to do much of anything else ."
"fortunately , i have dsl at both ends of the move , but unfortunately , i have little time at either end ."
"since i ca n't do much of my own writing this month , i 'll try to put up <UNK> to other people 's good works ."
i 'll start with walter williams on <UNK> medicine .
i like his ending so much that i 'm going to blow it right here .
but do read urllink the whole article anyway .
"health care can have a <#> price to the user , but that does n't mean it 's free or has a <#> cost ."
the problem with a good or service having a <#> price is that demand is going to <UNK> supply .
"when price is n't allowed to make demand equal supply , other measures must be taken ."
<#> way to <UNK> the demand over a given supply is through <UNK> -- making people wait .
"i 'm wondering just how many americans would like canada 's long waiting lists , medical <UNK> deciding what <UNK> we get and an <UNK> of doctors ."
my favorite economics writing is that which uses the most basic <UNK> rules to say things most people do n't find obvious .
"when i wrote it , it had <UNK> and a link to jim <UNK> 's urllink <UNK> guide to the minimum wage ."
they did n't make it into the published version . )
that 's now <#> of the <#> pieces i 've written this summer .
i do n't remember who it was who introduced me to the idea of <#> - handed typing .
"( no , not that sort of <#> - handed typing ! )"
"if you know how to touch - type , you know that certain letters belong to the left hand and certain letters belong to the right hand ."
maybe it was <UNK> urllink <UNK> on urllink npr who did a piece on this idea .
talking about which entire words could be done with left - handed letters or right - handed letters .
( touch - type those names and you 'll get the point . )
"<UNK> , if it was him , did this bit back in the <UNK> ."
"so i tried to see exactly how politically <UNK> a "" poem "" i could manage with all left - handed words ."
"in the day and half since the <UNK> von <UNK> institute published "" urllink can markets predict elections ?"
""" i have received some very supportive email as well as questions and challenges in both email and the <UNK> blog ."
"rather than answering in several messages and both media , i 'll try to reply to everyone urllink here ."
i 'll also indulge myself by sharing with you <#> of the more <UNK> emails i received : hi !
"just went through your piece on "" can markets predict elections ? """
"this is <#> of the most <UNK> written , well <UNK> piece to come out the <UNK> blog in some time ."
"yesterday , the first email i got in response to my <UNK> article was this wonderful message : what a terrific debut !"
i followed the pentagon <UNK> pretty closely as it happened ( it was mentioned on <UNK> ) and arrived at conclusions much like the ones you present so <UNK> .
"i contribute to <UNK> daily articles myself , but i do n't think my own <#> <UNK> together approach your <#> for <UNK> import ."
"mine are mere chit - chat - interesting , perhaps even <UNK> , but very light on the <UNK> side ."
"yours would seem to put your subject to bed quite thoroughly , <UNK> , and permanently ."
"now we know what to think about this , and can move on to applications ( if any ) and other subjects ."
"i look forward to the next subject you tackle , <UNK> a <UNK> , informative , and satisfying treatment ."
"<UNK> 's article on fair trade coffee , and his piece on war and commerce should be standard reading for all anti - war folks ! )"
recently i began participating in their blog ( first example ; second example ) .
"today , i 'm quite proud to have my first article published on their website : urllink "" can markets predict elections ? """
do you get the difference between irrational and a- rational ?
something is a- rational if it is outside the realm of reason .
feeling happy or sad is neither rational nor irrational .
"my preference for vanilla over chocolate is not a rational preference , nor is it an irrational preference ."
it has nothing to do with <UNK> at all .
how about the difference between <UNK> and <UNK> ?
"i too often hear people use the latter as if it 's a $ <#> version of the former , but it 's the same distinction ."
something is <UNK> if it is outside the realm of morality .
something is <UNK> if it is part of the good - versus - bad universe and it comes down on the side of bad .
the urllink person who urllink <UNK> force is <UNK> .
a belief system that neither includes nor <UNK> the existence of god or gods is technically <UNK> .
"pure <UNK> is , in this sense , an <UNK> religion ."
the difference between <UNK> and non - <UNK> is not whether <#> does or does not believe in god .
"it is an issue that applies to everyone , including <UNK> and non - <UNK> ."
"believe it or not , i am , tonight , for the very first time ever , watching the life of brian ."
"the <#> of us , standing at our <UNK> : david miller :"

[ turning to brian ] the life of brian !
[ laughter ] [ brian walks away in disgust . ]
"somehow , that stupid little <#> - second exchange managed to keep me away from monty python 's masterpiece for the next quarter century !"
""" regulations are a full - employment bill for <UNK> ! """
i promise that this blog wo n't just be a set of links to urllink gary north articles .
( it will also be a set of links to murray <UNK> articles ! )
now i 've already listened to urllink every mp3 that <UNK> makes available -- usually on my ipod while i do other things .
"( <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at most of the <UNK> university summer sessions , but i found this year 's particularly good ."
"he gave historical background , political implications , and a philosophical <UNK> of <UNK> . )"
my beautiful wife and i are in separate states tonight .
she loves urllink non <UNK> by <UNK> miller .
"like <UNK> , which she also loves , it is stupidly <UNK> on some basic economic issues -- but who is n't these days ?"
"still , there 's some real intelligence behind both those strips ."
my homepage randomly includes comic strips from my urllink collection of favorites .
are a couple of recent ones i quite liked .
( you can click on the reduced image to see the full - sized image . )
i recommend using a sealed container for filling equipment .
these types of <UNK> prevent <UNK> from entering the oil before it is installed into the equipment .
many of today 's <UNK> are <UNK> oil analysis with <UNK> count .
most of the damage are <UNK> too small to see with the naked eye .
if you are <UNK> oil analysis i strongly urge you to purchase some sealed oil <UNK> for transport to the machine from the drums .
here are some other suggestions for oil storage .
"always store drums inside , even closed drums breath when the temperature changes daily and draws in <UNK> and <UNK> ."
always re - close <UNK> when done using them to prevent dirt from entering .
keep your fill <UNK> closed to prevent <UNK> .
"mark your fill <UNK> to avoid cross <UNK> , oil name and brand at a minimum , also place <UNK> on the <UNK> when needed ."
color code your <UNK> and fill points to ensure accurate re - filling of machine .
keep waste oil and waste oil handling equipment in a different storage area to prevent <UNK> re - use .
the <UNK> we offer here at <UNK> are the oil safe <UNK> .
urllink contact <UNK> oil to order your today .
you can view some of my photos on my group site linked below :
urllink <UNK> do n't forget to sign up when you are there .
i will be posting some new photos on the site shortly .
i will also have my new site up in a couple of days so look forward to that soon .
things are going well this week i wanted to share some of my photos from my group listed above .
if you like any of them please let me know and i will post more from that series .
i will send you a disk for a low low price .
i have been debating how much to charge for the <UNK> ?
and i feel that <#> would be a fair amount to ask for each disk .
i will have some other <UNK> that i will be working on later on this month that will be available .
if you are reading this and wish to purchase a disk please send me payment via <UNK> to urllink <UNK> for $ <#> and i will send you <#> .
i should have a preview of the disk on my site by the end of this week .
"well , we went into town shopping today , and did our <UNK> stop at the <UNK> ."
"i really , really wanted to get a medium chocolate <UNK> cone ."
"instead , i got a kid - sized vanilla cone , and it really was just as good ."
"<UNK> found some junk candy , you know , those boxes like you get at the movie theater , for <#> cents at walmart ."
you would have thought he found the holy <UNK> !
"i did n't even look at what all they had , surprising since i love candy . on the way home"
<UNK> were talking about my wanting to lose this weight .
"i have been lucky so far , to not have any weight related problems ."
"as a matter of fact , that 's the first thing i do when i am in a social setting ."
"( but the answer is no , i was n't bigger than <UNK> )"
i definitely <UNK> her body type ... and lifestyle .
"like mom , up until now , i have lived a very <UNK> lifestyle ."
"i was never taking time for myself , and never paying attention to how much i was eating ."
"urllink me , with my father , the <#> year old running machine ."
"taken june <#> dad , dear dad ."
always getting slack because he always talks about how fit he is and how much he runs .
dad takes time for himself and eats right .
"did richard simmons "" sweat and tone "" <#> minutes ( after driving all over creation looking for an <UNK> to use with it ."
"i swear , those things used to be all over the place !"
"then , after dinner that same night , i felt like walking ..."
i went <#> <#> miles in <#> minutes .
"that 's it , my first week done ! !"
"well , i started tuesday morning , actually late monday night when signed up as an online member of tops ."
i 'm embarrassed to look in the mirror any more .
"so , i decided , it 's just time to do it ."
"i am married to a wonderful man who has stayed by my side , and thankfully , tells me that i am beautiful no matter what ."
he has seen the pounds come on with each <UNK> never leave .
"he now gets up early early and runs , so now"
i get up too so i can get my exercise in before the <UNK> get up and the chaos starts .
"actually , i am too embarrassed to let my dear children watch me exercise ."
"so i hit the treadmill on tuesday morning , and managed to do <#> minutes ."
"i eat too that morning , as well as use my tops <UNK> software ."
"this let me put in my weight , age , height and activity level to determine how many calories it get each day ."
"hmmm , <#> pounds , moderate exercise , that gives me <#> calories each day ."
my starting weight is <#> and i have set my goal weight at <#> .
this means that i have <#> pounds to lose .
"( float , float , float ! ! ) <#> ."
"exercising <#> minutes a day , <#> days a week ."
"hmm , will that keep me from getting board ? ?"
"if <UNK> is picked , i 'll do <#> minutes on the <UNK> too ;)"
i will be weighing myself every tuesday morning and i will post it here for all the world to see ! !
"i set a short term goal too , to get below <#> pounds ."
"easy , <UNK> met goal aug <#> <#> ! !"
"well , i 've finally made the choice to make a change in my life ."
i have been carrying around this extra weight too long .
this blog will serve to <UNK> my journey .
"for more information on how i 'm doing it , and find great support of your own in the same quest visit :"
"well , here 's the results of my work for the second <UNK> i lost another <#> pounds ! !"
i met my first short term goal of getting below <#> pounds .
my new goal is to get below <#> pounds .
"i have updated my exercise for week <#> , be sure to read how much i moved my butt this week ! !"
"( hey , a woman needs good shoes right ? )"
"so , i give the idea to my husband and he is prepared to put out <UNK> dollars for a new pair of shoes ."
"i 'm looking at the target ad , and they have a nice pair of shoes in there ."
"can you believe it , they are only $ <#> ."
"i go out to town , and i am trying on shoes ."
( my husband comes home with $ <#> dollar running shoes . )
"i kid you not , these are made just as well as any other more expensive shoes , and are just as comfortable ."
"we have both worn them for exercise , and are more than happy with our purchase ."
"back in october , i joined <UNK> and by feb had lost <#> pounds ."
they showed me i could eat reasonable <UNK> of normal foods and lose weight .
"i sure loved the <UNK> of the points program , plus the <UNK> little book to track my points in ."
"then , it <UNK> on me <#> day , that it was me who made the difference , not the <UNK> ."
"spring comes along , and we talk of going back home to visit my family ."
"talk about stress , i could do a separate blog about how stressful visiting my family is ."
"instead of talking about it , i began to eat . and eat , and eat , and i ate all the way through our vacation ."
i found myself within <#> pounds of where i began in <UNK> .
something was said about my coming home that really bothered me and recently i really made a connection about it .
"my parents are divorced , and up until a few months ago i had a <UNK> relationship with my father ( mom too ) ."
"alright , you know that i already case public places to see if i am the <UNK> <#> there or not ."
"going home was horrible for me because of the "" acceptance "" factor to begin with . """
what will they say when they see how fat i am ?
""" i walked into my fathers house for the first time during that visit , and my step - mom hugged me and called for my dad ."
"we hugged , he stepped back , and said , "" what a beautiful woman you are ."
"mary , is n't she pretty ? "" that in itself changed my world ."
"he , in that <#> sentence helped me to begin to accept myself ."
i cry just to think of it again .
"listening to a radio program yesterday , that was taped in feb <#> , i heard dr ."
he said that a key to weight loss success is the emotional factor .
he <UNK> self acceptance becomes a barrier to success .
"thinking about going home , worrying about what people will say about me , caused me to lose track of my goal ."
"right now , i am back on track , the connection has been made again , and i am happy ;)"
tues <#> - <#> - <#> walked <#> miles ...
"( yay ! ) <#> min . also took kids to zoo by myself , so lots of walking there !"
"lol sat and sun , off ! !"
mon <#> - <#> - <#> <#> mile <UNK> <#> min <#> sec .
"well , i hit the scale tuesday morning to see how my hard work paid off ..."
"i checked <UNK> , and my average <UNK> intake was ...."
"some days more , some days less , this was the average for the first week ..."
i 'm starting this a couple of hours before my first personal training session with mo the boot camp lady .
"a good weight for someone of my height , which is a hair or <#> shy of <UNK> "" ."
"when i 'm being <UNK> , which is generally all of the time , i 'd prefer to be about <UNK> ."
so there are a few <UNK> in that paragraph that could stand a <UNK> or <#> .
over the next few weeks and months each <#> of them is going to get <UNK> in <#> way or another .
"i can at least put out the facts , the stuff that 's <UNK> true ."
i 've been on medication for <UNK> ii since august of <#> .
"it 's always been the same meds , just different <UNK> ."
i was originally on <UNK> of <UNK> ( <UNK> to those who do n't think <UNK> ) and <UNK> of <UNK> ( no generic equivalent there ) .
"a few twists and turns later , i 'm essentially on <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> ."
discussions about <UNK> weight gain and some links to interesting studies and articles might appear in the future .
"might not , depending on my ability to focus on <#> thing at a time ."
"i also <UNK> to and from when the mood struck , but once i had the car it did n't happen so often ."
"not <UNK> , weight gain <UNK> , though the <UNK> makes it difficult to <UNK> things ."
i 'm moving from <UNK> to <UNK> ( <UNK> ) and possibly off of <UNK> as a result .
"could be as minor as a rash that <UNK> a mild sunburn , could be as serious as third - degree burns , and some people have died ."
i 'm working my ass off to try to get a job back downtown again . working more activity into my day
is always a better way to lose weight than to hit the gym and then sit my ass in a car for <#> km .
"maybe i 'm <UNK> it , but since i 've been in the <UNK> i 've worked downtown , until last february ."
"there are a couple of possibilities at present , we 'll see how they pan out ."
"as for the name of this thing , it is a good song ."
"it also can be applied , in a rather <UNK> but <UNK> take - charge kind of way , to my weight ."
"but most importantly , it 's how i feel when i know a <UNK> episode of some sort is going to hit ."
"they do n't really hit , they <UNK> me ."
as they come from a higher place than just an average mood the down - ness feels worse for it .
"i could have called the blog "" nameless dread "" , i suppose , but i wanted something that could be taken as at least a bit <UNK> ."
being in a car for an hour at a crack does have its advantages .
you forget that you ca n't actually use your legs .
"ankles , sure , even a bit of <UNK> . getting out of the car after an hour has many <UNK> ."
like trying to <UNK> myself up on legs that are working at about a quarter of their usual strength .
"yes , i saw my trainer again last night and , i imagine it 's clear , she worked my <UNK> ."
you know that <UNK> chair thing you can do against a wall ?
but i had to hold it for a minute .
"and as la said , people want results fast , so pushing them harder than they likely push themselves will speed things along ."
i 'm pleased that i did n't sign up for <#> sessions .
saving about <#> bucks on a bill of over <#> bucks does n't strike me as a great deal .
"i 'm signed up for <#> of them , the next <#> 's tomorrow ."
"like , for instance , more muscle burns more calories ."
"i knew this , but did i do more weights at the gym ?"
"no , i spent all of my time on <UNK> ."
"la wants me to try transit , which will give me some zone - out time , but that 's at least <#> hours each way ."
"maybe i can catch a ride with someone on the way in or home . probably in , because there 's no time limit at the other end ."
"<UNK> , are n't i. say it 's typical of my <UNK> , but there it is in any case ."
"and she 'd be back where she started , or worse , in no time ."
like people who lose weight and gain it back and more .
"and , yes , to the casual <UNK> that too would be typical of my <UNK> ."
it 's unfair to think that you can <UNK> to any sort of set <UNK> plan when you 're hanging out with parents .
particularly if by necessity the revised <UNK> plan suggests alcohol and plenty of it .
"hence the salty <UNK> stuff , in this case urllink hint of lime <UNK> ."
though my lips have <UNK> to about half their volume with <UNK> <UNK> in my mid - section .
"this is a long weekend , which is why i 'm back on sunday night ."
"big on protein and <UNK> , moderate to low on carbs , way low on <UNK> ."

she throws up almost every time she eats now .
i gave her a <UNK> and she <UNK> good after it .
if she does n't start eating good tonight we 'll make a trip to the doctor .
by now you 've probably heard at least a little something about the libertarian party .
"we have candidates running for local and state level positions all across the country , and currently <UNK> over <#> <UNK> in public office ."
many people are even aware that the libertarian party is the third - largest political party in american politics .
"these <UNK> say more about the <UNK> of the people who hold them , than they do about the libertarian perspective ."
"despite all the confusion , the libertarian philosophy is especially easy to understand ."
"for example , <UNK> are opposed to `` <UNK> attempts to use the government to <UNK> <UNK> buying practices by <UNK> <UNK> on certain goods and <UNK> ."
"if you 're not conservative and you are not liberal , where do you fit on the political spectrum ?"
the traditional left - right spectrum is <#> that political <UNK> have recognized as <UNK> for some time .
democrats and green party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum .
"on the right - hand side , we find people who believe that it 's the government 's job to <UNK> our social lives ."
republicans and constitution party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum .
the closest you can come to <UNK> <UNK> on a <#> - <UNK> <UNK> spectrum is to plot us directly in the middle of the <#> <UNK> .
this is the only place on the line where you could put people who <UNK> believe in controlling each others lives either in an economic or a social sense .
"however , this fails to take into account that , like all other political groups , <UNK> come in <UNK> degrees ."
it also makes it difficult to find a place to put people who believe that government should control both economic and social decisions .
it seems clear that the simple <UNK> political spectrum falls short of accurately describing the various mix of political opinions .
<UNK> often use a short quiz in order to show people where they might fit within this more accurate type of political spectrum .
"if you have not already done so , click here link to <UNK> and take the quiz for yourself ."
you may be surprised to see where you fit !

<#> <UNK> ( on stands ) show the debate .
"<#> <UNK> , <#> in front of each tv ( representing bush and kerry ) and <#> for <UNK> ."

"of course , the <#> <UNK> problem is not being <UNK> time to respond , so maybe a <UNK> is probably in order ."
"of course , having supporters there would be great too ."
"if done in a professional and serious manner , without a hint of anger or sarcasm , it could have a great effect ."
"this could create a real david and <UNK> situation , earn <UNK> great sympathy and respect and show that he is qualified and deserves to debate the other <#> ."
"just imagine a picture of it with an <UNK> story , e.g. "" is this democracy ? """

"as long as the media <UNK> the <UNK> as legitimate , there will only be bush - kerry on the stage ."
the hope we can have is that the citizens ' debate commission urllink <UNK> is seen as the legitimate debate commission by the american people and the media .
"but the media likes a <#> - way horse race , and the media and american people accept the <UNK> as legitimate ."
"these are the planned <UNK> by the citizens ' debate commission debates : capital university ( columbus , oh ) sept ."
"<#> <UNK> college ( <UNK> , pa ) sept ."
<#> we need to understand that our goal should be to force bush and kerry to participate in these debates !
( emphasis added ) the only way that'll happen is if the media becomes convinced these are the legitimate debates and the <UNK> is not .

just wondering if any <#> out there plays the <UNK> games ?
specifically on <UNK> ? i 've hit some <UNK> and after spending hours doing searches have n't found the help .
besides even if you do n't have any help at least it 's a good conversation .
ok let 's get this going ... life in general is an amazing thing .
i mean think about it ... we all are born grow up and die .
on average a human lives <#> - <#> years .
how much can <#> accomplish in those <#> years ?
we as humans do most of our learning in the first <#> years of our lives .
in some cases even earlier ages stray from the norm .
i remember just a few days ago being in a gas station and there was a guy in there with his son .
the child was about <#> and for the most part was a typical <#> year old .
he wanted everything he saw and made sure everyone knew it .
the dad was doing what any parent would do and was calmly keeping his eye on his son and telling him no that he ca n't have those things .
he kept telling him to quiet down and to come over to where he was .
the child wanted nothing to do with it as any <#> year old does .
there was <#> item in particular the son wanted and he <UNK> with his dad to get it .
"as the dad was finishing up he looked at his son and <UNK> said "" no you ca n't have it . """
"the son in turn backed himself against the door and yelled out , "" you 're a <UNK> <UNK> . "" and pushed the door open ."
i think everyone in the store dropped their jaw .
i 'm not blaming this particular incident on society in general .
a lot of what this particular child has learned has been at home and in places he has been with his parents .
however i have been in elementary schools and walked down the halls and have heard the same if not worse out of school age kids .
the amazing part is that it happens in front of teachers and not a word is said to the students .
"there have even been times that a teacher has spoken up and the child turns and looks at them and says "" what ever "" and <UNK> them off ."
again a lot of the language is learned at home but by schools and teachers not saying anything is <UNK> the behavior .
they might as well be telling the kids they can talk how ever they want .
think about this - who do you spend most of your waking hours with ?
for most people it will be the people you work with and not your family .
who do school age kids spend most of their waking hours with ?
i 'm not saying schools are the cure all to the problem .
it needs to be a joint effort between the parents and the schools .
the schools need to <UNK> and in some instances punish for the language and <UNK> that the students display .
parents need to back it up at home and do the same thing .
kids today have very little or no respect for authority .
i do n't think anyone can pin point exactly when things started going wrong in society with young people .
however if you look back in history i think you can get a pretty good idea .
some people that went through the <#> 's as teens and young adults might think that it started there when they stood up to the control and authority .
i think the problem actually started before that .
"as with any country , young or old , they have to be able to function ."
for this to happen there has to be money to support programs that are presented to the citizens of that country .
"in the basic sense you can <UNK> that if every working person in the country contributed say $ <#> a month the program , as designed should function ."
you put people in charge of various programs and they draw a salary - as it should be .
"the problem is that people are paid out of several programs that they <UNK> , manage or what ever ."
it 's not that they get paid say <UNK> a year to manage <#> programs they are paid <UNK> a year because each program pays them <UNK> .
now if that is just the top level you also have the lower level managers who really do most of the work .
plus remember all the managers from the top down usually have a staff of <UNK> who draw a salary and in some instances <UNK> have <UNK> .
"so a program that is designed to bring in x amount of dollars to function , and would under normal circumstances , now is running a deficit ."
the people of the country have come to rely on the program but in order for the program to keep going the government needs to raise taxes .
so taxes are raised slightly to make up the difference .
this is acceptable keeping in mind that society is growing and more people are coming into the work force to aid in the funding of the program .
however more often than not <UNK> and government officials sneak in pay raises for themselves so the program really barely breaks even .
the tax raise in itself would have brought the program to the black instead it 's border line .
so how does all this affect society and how did it affect respect for authority ?
the children were basically <UNK> <#> hours a day .
"children said "" yes <UNK> "" , "" yes sir "" , thank you , were active and helpful in the community and host of other things ."
i 'm not saying all of society was like the <UNK> 's but there was definitely respect from children and young adults no matter what .
"kids knew that "" wait until your father gets home ! "" meant there was going to be a <UNK> ."
now as society grew and more and more programs developed and government got bigger it needed more money to support <UNK> and programs .
"tax <UNK> were the "" only "" way to increase the funds for the programs ."
parents are unable to <UNK> the children and the schools blame the parents for the children acting out as they do .
the schools begin to take more and more responsibility for the children and begin taking away what little control the parents have over the children .
this is <UNK> into the children and soon a parent ca n't discipline a child when they act out .
i remember growing up and being a <UNK> - key kid .
my parents had to do what they could to raise us and put food on the table .
there were times when my parents would alternate days that they would eat just to make sure us kids had food to eat .
we as kids had <UNK> time like you would n't believe .
we got into trouble and did things we should n't but we all knew that if we got busted doing something really wrong we got the belt .
society has <UNK> <UNK> children so much that now the parent gets <UNK> off to jail for <UNK> their children .
the is a difference though between <UNK> and beating the hell out of the child .
there is a big difference between a slap for swearing and a closed <UNK> punch to the face .
there is a big difference between a couple hits across the butt with a belt and <UNK> a child and <UNK> them .
taxes continue to rise and parents are spending less and less time with the kids .
the kids have more and more free time to do what they want .
hello ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
? if i ca n't discipline a child and teach them the difference between right and wrong and how to respect authority then
we are teaching them that there is no consequence for their actions ... at least not to them .
they do n't need to take responsibility for their actions .
they do n't have to take responsibility for anything they do .
kids that are of working age want to work but expect to get paid far more than what entry level should be .
they expect to get paid full <UNK> even though they called in <#> out of <#> days .
they expect a lot and expect that everything be handed to them .
the problem still remains they have no respect for anything and a lot of times no respect for themselves .
next time you are at a fast food restaurant look at the kids behind the counter and preparing your food .
if you were a business owner would hire them with the way some of them look ?
we have been trying to get her to understand that if she wants a decent job that when she goes for interviews she needs to dress <UNK> .
she has the interview process down and how to answer questions and what questions are generally asked .
"her personality is great , she 's out going but she lacks the respect ."
we tell her that she needs to buy casual clothes for interviews and in some cases she will need to dress that way if she gets hired .
"she continues to show up in the trendy "" teen clothes "" ."
what kills us is that she sits there and still wonders why she did n't get the job .
i 've been in positions where i am the <#> in the hiring position .
then they wonder why they do n't get hired ! !
what does it all boil down to and how did things get they way they are ?
really there is no <#> entity that can be blamed .
"granted the government with taxes , over spending , miss <UNK> funds , etc had a major role it 's not entirely their fault ."
"from government , to schools , to parents , to <UNK> , to tv , various media to the man down the street ."
"i 'm not saying that freedom of expression or speech needs to be removed but i think society needs to "" get back to basics "" ."
"people need to interact more with local , state and federal government to get the changes that are needed to start to correct the problem . a place to start"
would be allowing parents to use <UNK> punishment for discipline with out the fear of being <UNK> off to jail .
it 's not the cure all but it 's a start .
"take a look around you , look at your children , look at how you were raised , look how others are acting ."
start teaching that actions result in consequences good and bad and to take responsibility for yourself and others .
"well , i decided to try my hand at blogging ."
it 's a little different <UNK> in a place that i know others can see .
usually i keep my <UNK> private and no <#> ever sees it .
so i guess i will just have to be careful what i write here .
"i do want to be able to express myself fully though , so anyone who reads this will know my inner thoughts ."
i really hope my blogging does n't bore anyone .
i guess i should start at the beginning .
"i was raised , along with <#> older brothers , by my mom ."
"she did a great job raising <#> kids on a single woman 's salary , working in a sewing factory ."
i went through a pretty deep identity crisis i guess as a teen .
"i got married at <#> , became a mother at <#> ."
i do n't know if i was running away from something or running toward something .
"but i know i was running , and i was n't looking to see where ."
"there was some abuse , but i wo n't go into great detail about that ."
"i have put it behind me , healed and moved on ."
i took a job working in a sewing factory .
that 's what i was supposed to do was n't it ?
"grow up , find a man , catch him and live happily ever after ."
"i was <#> , and was getting married again ."
"he had his own reasons , and i had mine ."
"we talked about them , and decided to help each other out ."
"everyone thought i was upset because i loved him and would miss him , but that was n't it ."
"i know this sounds cliche , but times were tough ."
"i did n't have a car , i had very little money , and i now had rent and <UNK> to pay ."
"i suffered through the first year using baking soda to brush my teeth and wash my hair , because i could n't afford <UNK> and shampoo ."
i remember the first year that i got back my very own income tax return !
"i bought myself a living room suite , my daughter some nice clothes and a <#> - <#> - dollar car ."
i felt like i was on my way to becoming a productive member of society .
"i stayed single for about <#> more years , gaining <UNK> but not in <UNK> ."
i still felt like a big loser because i could n't fulfill the obvious dream of catching a man .
"i learned how to change the oil in my car , and how to replace <UNK> and an <UNK> ."
i could pay all the bills and still have enough left over to buy things that i needed like <UNK> and shampoo .
how could i be when there was no man to take care of me ?
"so , once i started having a little extra money , i started going out ."
"i did n't go far , i did n't trust my <#> - <#> - dollar <UNK> too far from town ."
"mostly , i just <UNK> around the town i lived in ."
"i knew most of the other kids who were cruising , but i was the only <#> who <UNK> with my daughter in the car with me ."
"sometimes my mom kept her , sometimes i took her with me ."
"let ' face it , i was in the market for a new man ."
"i met several , but none of them wanted to date someone who had a child ."
most of them just thought i was easy because it was obvious i had already had sex .
"and i was after another , and most of the time , they won ."
i never got what i was looking for .
"i did n't really know what i wanted to be yet , but they said i could decide that later , after my first <#> years of college ."
"i was <#> , i had <#> <UNK> under my belt , i was a single mom , and i was miserable with my life ."
i signed up at the local community college for some basic classes .
i spent less time going out and more time doing homework .
"but i knew i was in the right place , because i could meet a college boy now ."
", it was always about finding a man ."
"then <#> day , just before thanksgiving , i ran into a guy that i had gone to highschool with ."
"he was a year behind me in school , and we never really talked much in school , but we had known who each other was ."
"he asked me out and i agreed , i was still looking for that someone to cling to ."
"after all , everyone knows a woman is n't worth as much if she does n't have a man in her life , right ?"
"this guy was a good catch , too ."
"he had a good job , a new truck and came from what you would call a prominent family ."
so i had to do whatever it took to catch him .
"we decided to live together first , i was scared ."
i knew i was no good at this marriage thing .
"when i told him that , he insisted that it was n't me , that it was just that i had chosen the wrong person before ."
he showed himself to be the perfect man .
"he helped with the <UNK> , and never complained when i wanted to go to yet another home interior party with my family ."
he did n't seem to mind when i spent a little too much and he always bought me nice birthday gifts and sent me flowers at work .
i was getting what i had always wanted : a man with a good job and every <#> thought he was a good catch .
we decided to live together before we got married .
he said it would make me feel more <UNK> after being through so much in the past .
i thought it was a good idea for the same reason .
"we were planning on getting married someday anyway , so it was the thing to do ."
things were going pretty great for me at the time .
"we did a lot of fun stuff together , and we shared a lot about our <UNK> ."
"he was very kind to me , and i was falling in love more and more everyday ."
"i was still in college and he seemed to be very supportive about it at first , but as time progressed , he started"
say he was afraid i was going to meet some college boy and then i would n't want him anymore .
"i tried to explain to him that the life i had with him was all i ever really wanted , but he must have been very insecure ."
"eventually , the pressure became too much for me to handle , and i just quit school ."
"it really did n't matter anyway , i had a man , did n't i ?"
not long after i dropped out of college he shared a story with me about an ex - girlfriend whom he said he had broken up with .
several months later he had found out that she had <UNK> his <UNK> child .
"he had no idea that she had been pregnant , and had no say in that decision ."
he claimed to feel like something was missing in his life now .
"it became obvious to me that he wanted another child , so i happily agreed to stop taking the birth control ."
"i found out that i was pregnant on my 22nd birthday ( remember that point , it will have significance again in about <#> years ) ."
we were both very excited about the coming baby .
"we moved into a bigger apartment , bought some new furniture and started buying baby items ."
"well , i must stop the story there for now ."
i am sure i have left out somethings that are would be of interest to anyone who is interested enough to read this blog in the first place .
i promise i will add the things i left out as i remember them .
i may even go into more detail of the abuse <UNK> by my first husband .
god bless and thank you for taking time to read my story .
kitten little is running around the computer room <UNK> <UNK> .
her mama is outside having some alone time without her sole <UNK> .
i wonder as i watch this little <UNK> of <UNK> creep around the room exactly what does this all look like to her ?
are we just big <UNK> <UNK> noisy creatures to them ? or am i a mobile can <UNK> and resident ear <UNK> ?
"i love how when i get home they all rush to the door , calling out in their very <UNK> ways ."
it 's like a class of grade school children rushing to be the first to <UNK> on the other .
"i can imagine what lies they have come to tell me .... "" mom !"
"when <UNK> was alive , she was always my first <UNK> ."
"i would pick her up , rub her fuzzy grey belly and ask her how her day was and if she had been a good kitty ."
then an ear scratch for my maine <UNK> who does not like to be picked up .
it looked like some weird old ladies be - <UNK> hat come to life on my head .
then we would fill the dinner dishes and i would have to stand guard over sam 's bowl .
"sam , for as big as she is , is a real pussy ."
"she has no teeth and has to eat wet food , so the other cats try to sneak into her dish ."
now there is not a room in the house with a door that opens <UNK> which is safe from her .
i am waiting for her to figure out how to operate the refrigerator door next .
how can it be that <#> cat can mean so much that even <#> years after her death i still <UNK> her loss .
"i have seen small kittens which look like her at the <UNK> sites , but when i pick them up , there is something missing ."
she was the sort of cat the <UNK> would have dressed in <UNK> and <UNK> .
she was a grey and black <UNK> <UNK> with large <UNK> shaped sea green eyes .
"never having had a litter of her own , she still tried to nurse the stray kittens i brought home frequently ."
"she ruled the <UNK> , often putting my <#> and <#> pound dogs in their place ."
a mighty <UNK> of <UNK> mice and milk bottle <UNK> .
the year she suffered with cancer was horrible for both of us .
"i knew something was wrong when she stopped greeting me at the door with such enthusiasm , but i put it down to her advanced age ."
"after all , as i get older , i get less social too ."
"<#> day , she jumped on the table in front of me , lay on her back and showed me the lump where her <UNK> used to be ."
"i took her to the vet , and i asked them to put her to sleep ."
"the doctor on duty tried to talk me out of it , wanting to do tests , surgery , <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> efforts ."
i took the <UNK> he gave me and went home with her .
"<UNK> and i fought <UNK> for a week about putting the medicine on , taking the pills and not biting at the growing mass ."
"finally , i sat with her in the kitchen and explained to her about the vet 's suggestions ."
how could i torture this precious life in front of me for months just to have a maybe chance of survival ?
then she put her <UNK> on my arm and head <UNK> me and i knew i could not do that to her .
i brought out her carry case and told her it was time .
she got in slowly and we went back to the vet .
"he looked at the chart , looked at my angel and told me i had made the right choice ."
"the cancer was too far gone for anything to fix it , and she was in a great deal of pain ."
when the <UNK> finally kicked in and her spirit let go of her body i knew it .
"i cried for what seemed like hours , but i knew i had done the right thing for her ."
i loved my cat enough to stop her pain .
do i love my mother enough to do the same for her if the need <UNK> ?
"could i stop being selfish long enough to ease their pain , even if it meant that i would be alone ?"
the moon is full and makes the <UNK> seem to glow in the dark .
i sat on the grass which was still wet with the days rain and i watched the <UNK> and <UNK> circle my yard .
at that exact moment i felt an overwhelming sense of <UNK> with nature .
the smell of the mint and <UNK> was like exotic <UNK> around me .
everything i sit in my garden i feel peaceful and welcomed as if the plants have just wrapped hundreds of small green arms around me .
i feel their <UNK> touches and can almost hear the green <UNK> laughter of the flowers who are so glad to see me .
"each plant stretches itself up , begging for my attention . "" here"
""" i find myself talking to them , my small <UNK> children , telling them each to wait their turn , i promise i will get to you next ."
and then i come back into the house and the reality of my household <UNK> on me .
"the house is a mess and no matter how much i clean it , the <UNK> bring more <UNK> everyday while i am at work ."
education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self - confidence .
all i really wanted to do was comment on an entry in andi 's blog .
i did n't want to send it anonymous so i created a profile .
now what the hell am i supposed to say on this thing ?
my answers on the survey below regarding depression and suicide sounded rather flip and i do n't want to leave it at that .
it 's a serious subject that causes a lot of pain for everyone involved .
a person who attempts or <UNK> at suicide is obviously in a lot of pain for a long time .
"the people who love them are hurt ; they may feel abandoned , angry , guilty , helpless , emotions too complicated to <UNK> put into words ."
<UNK> and <UNK> are frustrated when a patient 's depression is <UNK> to treatment and sometimes they question themselves and their ability to help their patients .
when a patient attempts suicide they beat themselves up wondering why they did n't see it coming .
"they ask themselves , "" did i miss some important warning signs ?"
did i fail to take this person 's feelings seriously enough ?
"why could n't i save this person ? """
i borrowed the title for this little piece from a friend 's answer to this same survey question .
( what follows is by no means a <UNK> to her response .
it just got me thinking about suicide ) to just give up and quit and leave everyone else
", the people who care about you most in fact , to clean up the mess and try to make sense of it all , is certainly selfish ."
if the suicide is successful the <UNK> never recover .
it becomes a part of their psychological make - up forever after and colors their <UNK> of all events and relationships that follow .
it is n't a simple matter of feeling sad or overwhelmed or hopeless .
"those feelings certainly are a part of it , a part of being human ."
there a many degrees of intensity with which people experience these feelings .
the period of <UNK> and duration of the depression <UNK> greatly .
my depression was brought on by life circumstances that were multi - <UNK> and that got worse instead of improving over time .
shortly after this decision was made an event occured that was completely devastating .
even though i was taking medication at this point i reached beyond my limit and completely collapsed .
i was quite literally a broken human being .
i was <UNK> briefly and then began my attempt at recovery in a new ( considerably less than ideal ) place .
"i got tired of my own hurt , of my own anger ."
i did n't want to hear about it anymore .
"<UNK> i understood the intensity of these feelings would eventually <UNK> , and at times it helped to know that ."
but often the ' right now ' was absolutely and <UNK> unbearable .
and knowing i had <UNK> to function brought guilt and shame and self - <UNK> .
the sense of being a burden to those taking care of me was overwhelming .
"i would have given anything to get away from myself , even for an hour . even to sleep"
but i was unable to sleep without medication .
i just wanted it all to go away so that i could get on with my life .
since i have children dying simply was n't an option .
at the same time i was painfully aware that i was <UNK> them anyway .
that the people who wanted to help me were frustrated and worn out .
that relief for all of us was a long way off .
"the night i took all of my remaining medication at once was <#> of those weary , angry , lonely , guilt - ridden nights ."
my children were in another city in another state with their father .
i just wanted a break from the <UNK> torture coming from my brain .
i would have <UNK> to shooting the pope if i thought it would make the noise stop .
i took <#> of the pills that were supposed to calm me down and <#> that was supposed help me sleep .
still i felt <UNK> and still i was crying .
i shot off an angry e - mail to my husband and opened a bottle of wine .
i still felt miles underground in the cold black pit and i took <#> more of each pill .
at that point all judgment was <UNK> and it seemed to make sense to keep <UNK> pills until i passed out .
to this day i remember nothing that happened before waking up the next afternoon in a hospital .
"i do n't remember calling my step - father , which i 'm told i did ."
"i do n't remember a <UNK> kicking down my door , or the <UNK> or the ride to the hospital in an ambulance ."
"i do n't even remember my son sitting with me in the emergency room , hugging me and crying ."
he tells me i was quite awake and <UNK> animated and charming .
he has reported that the er doctor was frustrated that i repeatedly pulled the <UNK> .
i kept asking him where he went to medical school and what he thought of his training there .
where did he do his <UNK> and why did he choose emergency medicine ?
did he feel confident it was the right decision for him ?
at that moment he probably had his doubts .
"i do n't remember any of this conversation , or drinking <UNK> or anything else they did to keep my heart from stopping or my lungs from giving up ."
in my case there was mental illness involved .
the <UNK> is <UNK> depression - by all accounts powerful stuff .
"but it is n't at all clear , even to the professionals , if illness <UNK> my reaction to circumstances or if circumstances caused the illness ."
experiences <UNK> the brain that will do the <UNK> .
what is clear is that doctors and family members did n't ' cause ' what happened .
there is a lot going on inside our heads that nobody understands yet .
nobody should be expected to understand it all .
"it is entirely possible that the human brain is so sophisticated that it is n't sophisticated enough to comprehend everything it does , let alone why ."
""" you <UNK> and "" it ca n't be that <UNK> are not really fair to anyone ."
none of us is in a position to weigh in on what should be easy or natural to another person .
( and in my opinion a fascinating <#> . )
so for now i <UNK> all of your brains .
they 're working hard out there and doing a remarkable job .
this blog thing is like free therapy to me .
i used to keep a journal but since i’ve been married i haven’t kept it up .
i just never seemed to have time to take pen in hand and keep it up .
i don’t know what i would do without spell check .
"so , let me sit on the couch and free my memories ."
i think this helps to let out some of my child hood pains that seem to control me now later in life .
how odd that i choose a public forum in which to do this .
i don’t have to worry about will my husband read my journal .
it ’s <#> of the things i love about him .
but sometimes i think thoughts that would hurt his feelings and i don’t dare express them to him .
my reason for this is just that it is usually small petty things that would never make me love him any less .
there just is no reason in the world to say things that are going to make him feel bad . saying it doesn’t make me feel better .
i guess this is <#> of my <UNK> from when i was a child .
"my mother was a very harsh woman , to say the least ."
like so many of us i was abused as a child .
not as <UNK> as some of our children today .
my mother only left bruises she never broke anything ; the only thing she ever <UNK> was my way of thinking .
if you read my first blog you know i have a serious weight problem .
"so , let me lie down on this couch and talk about <#> of my early memories ."
i grew up in a small beach town in california called shell beach .
it ’s a beautiful place on the central coast .
i spent my evenings out in the front yard doing <UNK> .
but both my mother and step father worked .
my mother only let us leave the house if <#> of them were home so they knew where we were at all times .
"so , as you can imagine , we started getting fat ."
after we would pig out she would go throw up .
she would always make little comments like that .
"i was in tears and <UNK> but my mother was a very harsh , strong woman ."
i had no choice other than to do it .
"look at me now , i’m all grown up and all grown out !"
when i look back on it it ’s like she <UNK> me for something that she really created .
when i was in 7th grade i wanted to try out for basket ball .
my mother told me that i couldn’t because she wanted me home right after school .
"i didn’t make the team , most likely because at that point i was out of shape ."
how do i keep myself from doing this to chloe ?
i see myself doing it a bit with my husband .
like i mentioned he has worse eating habits than i do .
i think he is catching up to my weight too .
during my pregnancy we would both weigh in at my doctor visits .
he was in the <#> - <#> range .
"i always notice everything about his eating habits and that bothers me , the way he eats twice as much and finished first ."
i always wonder if he ever tastes his food .
when we are at a party where there is food everywhere i always see him eating something .
"whenever i look for him , there he is picking at this or that ."
"like me , always putting something in his mouth if food is around weather he ’s hungry or not ."
this is a <UNK> copy of my behavior too .
i suppose the only difference is i realize it and try not to do it .
my husband and i are both closet <UNK> .
we both sneak off to eat junk food .
his vice is <UNK> and mine is ice cream .
how do i keep negative thoughts out of my head ?
how do i not do this to chloe when i so desperately want her to grow up healthy and happy without the worries of being over weight ?
i am <#> years old and i have just given birth to my very first child .
my weight when i got pregnant was approximately <#> pounds .
early in the pregnancy i was diagnosed with <UNK> diabetes .
"i controlled this with diet , i tested my blood <#> times a week and my numbers were fine during the pregnancy ."
"i didn’t gain an excessive amount of weight while pregnant , but more than the <UNK> i saw wanted ."
on the day i gave birth to chloe i weighed in at <#> pounds .
these numbers seem so enormous when i type them .
i don’t feel like the <UNK> <UNK> person i am considered .
the day after i gave birth to chloe by c - section i was up and taking short walks .
despite my size and the way i am perceived at first sight i really do have a lot of energy and i like to be up and moving .
i will never be a home body by choice .
that day i walked down to the other side of the hospital wing and wanted to weigh myself .
i had just given birth to a healthy <#> pound baby girl .
"and , from what the doctors were telling me i had enough fluid to float a boat ."
i was hoping for a huge difference on the scale .
i stepped on and waited for the digital reading .
"i just <UNK> an <#> pound human being from my tummy , how could my weight loss only be <#> pounds ?"
in the days to follow i was being as active as i could .
while in the hospital i took as many walks as my pain would let me .
when i came home the next day we had chloe out and about .
it was only a couple weeks when i returned to have my <UNK> out and weighed in that the scale read <#> .
"but now , <#> weeks later , i’m not feeling as good ."
"i have not weighed myself , because i can only do this at the hospital ."
i have never found a home scale that will go up to <#> pounds .
"but tonight i am feeling so fat , so <UNK> , so <UNK> ."
with a <UNK> that doesn’t sleep through the night i find myself always tired .
but if i don’t stop then i don’t feel it .
"the minute i stop and sit down , i get sleepy ."
"chloe fell asleep right after randy , my husband went to bed ."
i put on my <UNK> and my bike shorts and got up on the <UNK> mill for about <#> minutes .
i got on the floor and did some leg <UNK> and stretches .
"even though my husband will “ diet ” with me , i can’t count on him ."
but i want more for myself and for chloe .
"i want more for randy too , but i have no control over that ."
i know that if we both were to loose some weight i would start feeling more attractive and sexual .
we have both put on a lot of weight since our wedding .
all the weight we worked so hard to take off .
"so , here goes ; i’ll start my list ."
i want to be able to sit indian style on the floor .
when did i loose the ability to sit indian style on the floor ?
the only way i can sit on the floor is with both my legs <UNK> out and apart .
i want to be able to sit indian style on the floor and put chloe in the middle like a fun chair .
and i want to feel comfortable on the floor .
i’m only <#> for crying out loud ! # <#> .
the next thing i want goes hand in hand with number <#> .
i want to be able to spring up from the floor to stand .
why is it such a production for me to get myself up off the floor .
my <#> year old mother has an <UNK> time of this !
# <#> . we have a small amusement park here in portland called <UNK> park .
"now , i grew up in california going to all the amusement parks ."
i want chloe to love these things too . but who will introduce this too her ?
who will take her on the rides and show her what fun it is ?
there is no way i would ever fit on any of the rides !
i have a hard time <UNK> my seat belt let alone an amusement park ride !
"well , i’ll tell you who will take her on her first amusement park ride ; i will !"
"that ’s right , this is all part of my motivation for wanting to loose weight ."
i want to take my daughter on a roller coaster ride .
i want to yell and scream and laugh with her .
when she wants to play hide and seek i don’t want to tell her i don’t want to play because i don’t have the energy to chase her around .
if chloe wants me to play tag with her damn it we will play .
i don’t want to send chloe on all my errands because i’m too lazy to do it myself .
“ i don’t want to get off this couch to answer the phone .
those words will never be spoken by my lips !
i love to play games and jump in <UNK> .
i don’t want this body to <UNK> me from doing what i want to do .
"and , i’m not wanting to be in a size <#> dress either ."
but i do not need to be this big .
if i could just drop <#> pounds i would be much more happy .
but what i really want is to someday dip below the <#> pound mark .
"i have n't seen that number on the scale since high school , and even then i think i was just over <#> pounds ."
"by this time next year i want to achieve numbers <#> , <#> , <#> , <#> , and <#> ."
i have a real unhealthy attitude about being fat .
something that i’m afraid i will put on chloe if i don’t get this <UNK> out now .
when chloe was born she weighed <#> pounds on the nose .
"a very healthy weight , although she was born <#> weeks early ."
she dropped down to <#> pounds because i was not producing enough milk for her
so we had to start <UNK> her with formula .
"in the beginning the doctors were worried about her loosing too much weight after birth , now she is in the <UNK> <UNK> for her weight ."
what can i do to keep this from happening ?
are there too many calories in my breast milk ?
lord help her if she is going to be pre <UNK> to being fat because i am .
"i don’t ever want to <UNK> her , but i don’t want her <UNK> out the charts for weight in children her age ."
i need to learn how to be healthy and raise chloe to be healthy .
i don’t want chloe to be a slave to food .
"food is supposed to be a necessity , fuel for our engine ."
why does this have to be decided <#> or <#> hours before we are going to eat ?
why is this <#> of the first things on his mind ? what ’s for dinner ?
every other thought is about what food is going into our mouth .
food is ruling my life and i want it to stop .
"oh , my stomach is <UNK> , i should eat something ."
” i couldn’t even tell you the last time my stomach <UNK> .
how do i learn to change my way of thinking ?
how do i avoid creating a food monster in my daughter ?
"i don’t want her to be everything i wasn’t , i want to be everything i wasn’t ."
"our kitty , molly , is a computer nerd ! every time dale or i are on the computer ( like right now )"
she hears the keyboard and will come into the room and jump onto our lap or onto the desk and <UNK> and/or falls asleep .
she loves to watch the <UNK> and <UNK> to catch it !
i 'm going to go to <UNK> to get a mouse <UNK> for her to chase .
"does anyone have an idea for a "" pet "" computer name we can give her ?"
"what if your <UNK> was magical , artistic , a dandy , or a <UNK> ? a sexy , hard man who cared about what you cared about ."

what if he were a man above this <UNK> political <UNK> that seems so <UNK> and trivial ?

all i want to do is locate blogs about a specific <UNK> gay to be <UNK> i ca n't find <UNK> that lets me do <UNK> 's very frustrating
i do n't have <UNK> to dump my thoughts .
i do need to clean my head out occasionally or i feel like i 'll explode .
"its raining here in eastern ohio and its <UNK> sucks , i hate this weather ."
but i think that it 's going to be inside .

there 's <#> guy there that we met before who is very cute .
so i 'm hoping that tonight may be interesting .
i 'm always up for some fun and my partner does n't care .
thank god sex is not an issue in our relationship .
"ok , i 'm gonna get off my soap box now ."
"well we had a good time , no sex , but my boyfriend got lots of attention from this cute blonde guy ."
we did n't get home till like <#> am .
it was fun but i 'm just getting way <UNK> old for this stuff .
"it 's supposed to be super hot <UNK> today , like <#> and way <UNK> humid for my taste ."
"i want to run today , but i 'm not running is this heat ."
hopefully it will cool down this evening and we can run this evening .

"i suppose i could <UNK> things i 've said in the past , but not right now ."
i find myself wondering about the etiquette of blogging .
"i 'm sure it 's mostly stream - of - consciousness stuff , but are there <UNK> rules ?"
colin <UNK> is funny perhaps <#> joke out of <#> .

"<#> hours of work , with no real break ."

"yes , i 'm for a secure america , but not at the expense of any of our civil liberties ."
"yes , i 'm for creating jobs in america , but not at the expense of the poor people in india and elsewhere that we 're <UNK> now ."
i 'm no more afraid of a terrorist attack on u.s .
"soil than i was on september <#> , <#> , or on march <#> , <#> ( madrid bombing ) ,"
"but that 's probably because i was n't blind to the possibility of it , the way many of my <UNK> appear ."
i 'm really going to have to get better at coming up with titles for entries .
i 'm going to just roll with this and see if a better title presents itself .
so i set up a fantasy football league today .
"i 'm a very big football fan , nfl and college ."
it 's fairly consuming for me during the season .
about <#> years ago i discovered the fun and simplicity of online fantasy football and i 've been hooked since .
"i have n't won a super bowl yet , but i 've had a team in every year ."
<#> years ago i was a small <UNK> of a point from $ <#> .
we all knew who it was but i could n't prove it .
i fired him for a lesser charge a couple weeks later .
"the worst part about it was he was stealing money from guys that were on his team , that reported to him . and were poor , too ."
this year i do n't think i 'm going to play in a money league .
"there were some other major issues between people in the league that just could n't be good sports , so i was pretty miserable most of the year ."
"this year i 'll probably play <#> , maybe <#> <UNK> ."
last year my wife played for the first time and loved it .
"it was pretty cool playing together in the same league , so i invited her into the free league i set up today ."
i 've got <#> friend that i work with and i know he 's going to join .
"it was n't really terribly surprising , as i went to bed pissed off ."
"i love her to death and could n't live without her , but god damn she can piss me off ."
i tend to let myself get really worked up over stupid shit like that and then carry it with me for a long time .
"granted , she kept digging herself in deeper this morning ."
"she just has almost no "" sixth sense "" of when to back the fuck off of me ."
"so , i 've been pissed off all day ."
"i went out this morning to take care of some errands and left her home , which is unusual for us on the weekends ."
she wanted to go get some new pants and i did n't want anything to do with that trip .
"it was a very nice , quiet morning away from the fucking dogs and the wife , yet i managed to stay good and pissed the whole time ."
i had them <UNK> in the kitchen while i was back here in the studio <UNK> around .
"then the pool guy shows up and sends both dogs , especially the puppy , into a never ending fit of barking ."
finally she came home and took them off my hands .
"i ended up <UNK> the door to the studio , putting on headphones , and playing the <UNK> just to drown out the fucking noise ."
that barking just takes me <UNK> into the red zone .
then she 's her typical <UNK> dumb ass self for most of the afternoon
so i <UNK> the laptop and have retired to the studio .
i 'm not really sure what she 's up to .
i had my babble filter turned on when she was telling me so i do n't <UNK> recall .
i should go take an interest in dinner to make sure things are moving in the right direction .
maybe i 'll fire up a little xbox football until she 's ready to eat .
"for some strange reason , i 've had the urge to write lately ."
"strange because in <#> years i ca n't remember having had that urge before , at least not quite in the same way ."
also strange because i 've never written anything in my life .
"i 've also felt really confused lately , but i 'm not really sure about what ."
i just have this underlying feeling like there 's something going on in my life that 's not in my control and that i do n't understand .
"it 's weird , it 's kind of like the unconscious mind <UNK> trying to break through into the conscious ."
"but above all else , it 's a nagging feeling , drawing so much of your thought that it almost comes to <UNK> ."
"so it <UNK> , and <UNK> , and <UNK> to the point that it starts to make you generally pissy ."
there 's a part of me that feels like maybe if i start writing this stuff down then perhaps i will start to understand it better .
"it 's something that i 'm not really comfortable talking about with my wife because , frankly , she 's a part of the general anxiety ."
"my wife happens to be about the greatest wife ever , so there 's no real reason that she should be a part of the anxiety ."
"but she also gets <UNK> to the short temper problem , just like the puppy ."
i guess in any relationship that there is a certain level of <UNK> that comes just from the extreme amount of time spent together .
"sometimes she deserves it , sometimes she does n't ."
arthur <UNK> is a character from the <UNK> 's guide to the galaxy series of novels .
if you 've read them then you may be able to appreciate why i chose that name for my anonymous blog .
it 's because most days i feel a lot like arthur - like i just woke up and found out that the universe was not what i expected .
more like all of a sudden everything is not what it was yesterday .
"i 've decided to keep this blog <UNK> <UNK> , at least for the time being , to my friends , family , etc ."
"even my wife , with whom i share most everything ."
i 'm discovering the feeling of freedom that comes with complete <UNK> .
i like it because for the first time i feel like i 'm able to completely expose my feelings without risk of being found out .
"not that i 'm a "" fake "" person by any means , in fact i like to think quite the opposite ."
it 's more that for many years i have kept my deepest feelings deep .
"i 'm very uncomfortable opening myself up to others , which kind of sucks when you 're a musician ."
i tried and failed on a couple of occasions throughout the years .
"i 'm hoping for some interaction to make this a living , <UNK> <UNK> ."
i hoping this does n't end up just to be about me and my issues .
"it 's been a fairly challenging weekend for me <UNK> ,"
so i 'm enjoying a few quiet minutes away from her and the damn dogs .
not that quiet - i 've got <UNK> <UNK> playing now .
i just discovered these guys in the last <#> weeks or so and they are the <UNK> - <UNK> .
"their style <UNK> be <UNK> to describe , so just go check out a couple of their sample songs posted on their web site at <UNK> ."
welcome to my <UNK> <UNK> on to the internet .
i 've recently been caught up in several different individuals ' blogs and find them fascinating .
i decided that perhaps it would be fun to start my own blog for several different reasons to be shared in a later post .
i 've just designed the basic blog setup and wanted to put an initial post in here .
you could very well be the first visitor ever to my new blog !
feel free to comment with whatever crosses your mind - that 's what i intend to do .
quick input - would it be too gross for me to post a picture of my wife 's <UNK> piercing here ?
"<UNK> it would be anonymous , showing only the relevant area ."
"i do n't think it 's gross , i happen to find it quite attractive , but i 'm a mild <UNK> ."
"i 'm not talking about a shot that 's super sexual in nature , just a decent digital photo of the area ."
"i know that some of my loyal visitors are women , and since this is n't a porn blog by nature i do n't want to run everybody off ."
"i know i said that this blog would be completely on my own terms , but in this case i 'll <UNK> to popular opinion ."
btw - i started reading the prophet by <UNK> <UNK> again yesterday .
<#> of my posts in the last week or so got me thinking about it
so i pulled it out for the first time in a couple of years .
his writing reminds me of an eric <UNK> guitar solo - so much is said with so few words .
it 's a short book and well worth the read .
"here i sit again , in the midst of prime sleeping hours and not sleeping ."
i 've been up for about <#> minutes and it does n't look like i 'll be going back to bed .
"i guess that 's why god , or juan <UNK> , made coffee , right ?"
so this shaped up to be an ok weekend .
"i did n't really get pissed at my wife too many times , so i guess it was a success in that respect ."
and i did n't spend as much time reading or writing as i had hoped .
"that 's kind of strange , as i did n't really do terribly much over the weekend , but i did n't ."
"it 's tough for me to write for the blog when the old lady is around , though i certainly have before ."
"face it folks , all politicians are <UNK> - it 's part of the job description ."
"i did spend a good amount of time in the studio this weekend , though ."
i did have a lot of fun just playing and learning some new tunes and <UNK> with some <UNK> programming ideas and whatnot .
"oh well , that 's just a good excuse to go shopping !"
of course a shopping trip would n't be a shopping trip if all i looked at was the crappy <UNK> that i need .
"if any of you are <UNK> wealthy and are wondering what to get me for the next holiday that you buy gifts for , buy me urllink this ."
"the cheap <#> is surely sufficient , but as long as i 'm dreaming i might as well shoot for the moon ."
my clients owe me a bunch of money that should be coming very soon .
"when that happens i 'll be many thousands of dollars richer , so maybe i 'll buy it then ."
"anybody know of a good guitar tech in dallas , <UNK> northern <UNK> ?"
so that was a part of my weekend - playing around in the studio and shopping at guitar center and online .
"by the way - great deals on <UNK> with lifetime <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> , and a good price on <UNK> , too ."
"if any of you are musical types , then you should definitely check them out ."
i 've always heard great things about their pro quality audio gear and digital recording stuff
"yes , she announced friday night that she was finally ready for the belly button piercing that she 's been talking about for months ."
it 's literally been a major driving force behind her losing all of the weight and getting in to shape as much as she has .
"far be it from me to interfere with my wife 's quest to become <UNK> ,"
so i took her down to <#> of the local tattoo and piercing <UNK> and got it done today .
"nice for me because the chick who did it was smoking , at least to me ."
she was painfully skinny with these super low rise jeans that barely stayed up .
"of course she was <UNK> all to hell and had no bra , showing off the piercings in her tiny , but very <UNK> , little <UNK> ."
"admittedly she did look like she could potentially have a combo problem of <UNK> addiction , but she was pretty sexy none the less ."
"she was clean , at least , which really made it more of an <UNK> thing than a <UNK> thing ."
my only real standard of comparison was when she had her <UNK> ( actually her hood ) done a few months ago at a different shop .
"that was a longer experience from start to finish , but over all better for both of us i think ."
"the shop was probably equivalent , though we both liked the girl who did the <UNK> better ."
naturally it 's very hot for me to see my wife laying with her legs spread eagle while another hot chick roots around in her <UNK> of <UNK> .
i think she said that <#> hurt more at the moment but less afterward .
"the new <#> is n't looking bad , but it certainly is n't looking as good as the <UNK> piercing did either ."
so i never had the whole tattoo <UNK> experience until recently .
i let it heal and re - pierced it when i was slightly less high and it worked out well .
they 've all been closed up for about <#> years now .
time flies . makes me long for the good old days before i was a corporate whore .
the scars are still there to remind me just exactly how much of a whore i am every day .
i did n't even mention the book i read - urllink the tao of <UNK> .
i originally read it a couple times back in the late <#> 's or early <#> 's and just recently bought it for my wife .
"i would n't call if overly <UNK> by a long shot , but it 's definitely worth the short time it takes to read ."
"if you 're like me and read it <#> years ago when it was all the rage and liked it , then re - read it again now ."
i picked a copy up off the amazon <UNK> brand new for $ <#> .
"again , i have n't <UNK> the <UNK> of the facts ."
<UNK> an interesting side - light on the election campaign .
subject : heinz <#> look at the label of a jar of heinz sandwich slice <UNK> .
"<UNK> in mexico "" check out some of your heinz products ."
"corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries , taking thousands of jobs with them ."
"however , he is trying to blame it on george w. bush ."
"as far as i know , bush has not moved <#> factory out of this country because he is not the owner of a single factory ."
"that can not be said about kerry and his wife , teresa heinz - kerry ."
"according to the wall street journal , the <UNK> own <#> <UNK> in europe and <#> in asia and the pacific ."
"in addition , their company , the heinz company , <UNK> <#> <UNK> in europe and <#> in asia ."
"also , they own <#> <UNK> in north america , some of which are in mexico and the caribbean ."
i wonder how many hundreds of american workers lost their jobs when these plants <UNK> to foreign countries .
i also wonder if the workers in mexico and asia are paid the same <UNK> and benefits as workers in the united states .
"however , kerry demands that other companies that <UNK> should pay the same benefits they did in the u.s ."
"why does he not demand this of the heinz company , since he is married to the owner ?"
"if kerry is elected , will he and his wife close all those foreign <UNK> and bring all those jobs back to america ?"
they 're making millions off that cheap labor .
<UNK> take that for what it 's worth .
so it 's saturday morning and i 'm finally sitting down to write a real post .
although the last several days have been busy nothing much happened worth writing about .
"i could certainly give you the play by play of some interesting things at work , but considering that i barely survived the torture without a stroke the first time"
i do n't know if i could survive <UNK> the events .
"oh , <#> <UNK> thing did occur , but it was to be expected ."
this is how the good wife did me when i did n't post for a couple of days .
"so i 've been watching hurricane <UNK> pretty closely , as i 've been terribly worried about my brother and sister ."
"my sister has a <#> week old baby , their first , in a relatively new home in <UNK> ."
"as far as i can tell , the eye of the storm pretty much rolled directly over her house last night ."
"i 've been quickly catching up on the damage reports and whatnot today , and i suspect everything is ok as long as they stayed home ."
"the real damage was over on the west coast , in the port charlotte area , where the storm came <UNK> ."
even now there are <UNK> standing guard over piles of bodies in a couple trailer parks that <UNK> ca n't get to yet .
"yeah , i know , what do you expect if you live in a trailer a mile from the ocean ?"
"i do n't feel sorry for them , but i do feel sorry for the owners of over <#> homes that were completely <UNK> ."
i feel sorry for the people who are <UNK> on top of each other in <UNK> right now wondering if their homes are still standing .
"my brother owns several homes over in the <UNK> area , including a condo on the beach ."
it 's a solid concrete building and he 's got steel hurricane <UNK> that are real cool .
"when you flip a switch they automatically roll over all of the windows and the entire balcony , protecting the glass and anything you have sitting outside ."
"the newest home that he actually lives in is north of melbourne in the satellite beach area , i think ( i have n't been there yet ) ."
i am prepared to strap myself to a large palm tree in my front yard ( much the way
"( besides , i do n't think mom would appreciate t - mo bringing a <UNK> and providing updates during the ceremony ! )"
"oh yeah , and his beautiful girlfriend and <#> beautiful dogs ."
"shit , they did n't even have radio in orlando for a while last night ."
"i 'll probably call later today , if there 's even phone service ."
"i 've already got my next couple of posts <UNK> in my mind , so they 'll be coming soon ."
"though , i 'll probably be back here in <#> hours writing some dark post about how much my wife pisses me off ."
i do n't want to hate my wife today .
"plus , she gave me <#> good fucking last night and i 'd like to get me a little more of that kind of sugar ."
"for those interested , there is a brand spanking new episode of <UNK> tomorrow night ."
they 've got <#> or <#> others done that will be <UNK> over the next couple of months .
check the <UNK> link in my sidebar for more details . and tomorrow 's episode should the good - <UNK> and <UNK> are back !
i 'm seriously going to change my shitty counter sometime when i have nothing better to do then stare <UNK> at html code .
"and you are probably starting to hate my "" p.s . """
is that how you write the <UNK> form of p.s .
i 've just returned to the world of the living for a minute .
i 've had a lot going on the last couple of days and i 'm hoping to check in a bit more this weekend .
"it 's actually been a decent couple of days , but the blog has suffered ."
"i wanted to put up a quick post but i 'm do lazy to log in and do it , so i 'm doing the email thingy ."
this tends to be a busy time of year for me .
i just have n't made time to write a post .
i have n't made time to read but i 've <UNK> kept up with the <UNK> report .
i just flipped over and realized i 'm behind a couple of posts .
", i 'll probably wake up at 4:00 am tomorrow as usual ."
"i 've got family in orlando and melbourne , <UNK> and i 'm very worried about them ."
sister with a new baby in orlando and a brother in melbourne .
that 's why i had the pc logged on - watching the radar .
"at first i thought it was pretty cool , but today it seems to be not be working and the stats page is kind of lame ."
"can anybody recommend a good , free <UNK> <UNK> for a blog ?"
"if so , let me know how i can return the favor ."
"here 's the story on my dogs , <UNK> in many posts prior to this ."
"sorry , dial up users , the pictures are inevitable ."
"our dogs are the center of our life , without a doubt ."
"we 're not the child bearing types , so our dogs get all of our affection ."
"both of them are "" pound puppies "" , mixed <UNK> that we picked up here and there ."
the oldest <#> is about <#> <#> years old .
"her mother , <UNK> , was a <UNK> <UNK> mix ."
"mixed with what no <#> knows , but i would suspect at least some border <UNK> based upon her appearance and some of our dog 's traits ."
"the father is <UNK> , though a black lab had been seen hanging around <UNK> 's yard around the time she got knocked up ."
that makes our dog a lab - <UNK> <UNK> - god knows what mix .
"neither my wife nor i had ever owned a dog before , but we had been wanting to get <#> for months ."
"i sent my <UNK> wife over to look at the puppies , and it was over when she saw the box full of <#> week old puppies ."
"i was going to save this picture until the end , but now seems very <UNK> ."
"here she is the day after we got her , <#> and a half weeks old ."
"we had been wanting a second dog for years , and we finally decided the timing was right ."
"so we did n't <UNK> any travel , perfect time to raise a puppy ."
"then we <UNK> over whether we should go the pure <UNK> route , adopt a pound puppy , or keep an eye out for an adult rescue dog ."
the <#> thing we did know was that we wanted a big dog .
we were leaning towards a golden <UNK> but had n't fully decided .
"my wife started casually looking around , watching the web sites from all of the local <UNK> and <UNK> , etc ."
it took the <#> of us about a <UNK> to decide that these were the puppies for us .
the <#> we found that we fell in love with first was a little girl named <UNK> .
"actually , since we figured she was certainly pretty enough to deserve a fancy name like the show dogs , she is officially named ivy <UNK> <UNK> stinky jr ."
but goes by the name of ivy ( sometimes stinky ) . here
she is the day after we got her .
"and if you can believe it , she 's actually <UNK> than she looks ."
"our older dog is very sweet , and was a very cute puppy , but this <#> is so unreal ."
"it 's exactly the dog my wife wanted - big , <UNK> , and very soft ."
and she stands several inches taller than the other dog .
"ivy never wants anything more than to lay in your lap , give kisses , and get her belly rubbed ."
"that she 's getting bigger , but cute nonetheless ."
"there 's a more recent picture down below on an earlier post , here 's another , slightly <UNK> <#> from the same night ."
"the older dog , <UNK> , is up to about <#> pounds ."
"she 's much more active than ivy , always has been ."
she grew up in a much smaller house with a much bigger yard .
she lives for her tennis ball and loves to swim in the pool any chance she gets .
she 's the <#> who sent us to the <UNK> er sunday night .
"first is <#> of my favorite puppy pictures of her at about <#> months old , the rest were taken about a <#> or <#> months ago ."
and of course i would n't leave you hanging without posting a couple pictures of them together .
"so there you have it , the loves of my life ."
driving in to work today i spoke with my mother for the first time in a couple of weeks and she had some shocking news to share .
"apparently there 's a been a significant <UNK> in the cold war between her and my grandmother , with whom i have not spoken in <#> or more years ."
"i 'm shocked , and frankly , disappointed as it 's easier to ignore her than it is to deal with her ( grandma ) ."
"i 'll write more later , but i just got to the office and figured this would give me a good excuse to test this whole email posting thingy ."
( apologies in advance if the email post does n't come through in the right format ) .
the outlet mall trip was very uneventful yesterday afternoon .
"first , joe <UNK> won his first game upon returning to the nfl , and a good game it was ."
the hall of fame game was <UNK> good last night .
perhaps it was karma making up for the early <UNK> due to storms last year .
"all in all , washington looked solid , i thought ."
i have to say that i did n't watch as closely as i typically do because of these fucking blogs .
that and the fact that i have a laptop with a wireless internet connection .
i literally could n't pull myself away to watch the game .
i definitely need to get more <UNK> in that respect or something is going to have to give .
"in the parts i watched , i felt like denver was worse than last year and washington was much better ."
"i 'm not a fan of either , but i am becoming a <UNK> <UNK> ."
"already like joe <UNK> and i can feel myself becoming a ' <UNK> fan , at least <UNK> ."
"no team will ever replace my beloved <UNK> , but i always like to have a couple secondary teams that i take an interest in ."
"lately it 's been the <UNK> and the <UNK> , but i 'm not feelin ' it for the <UNK> anymore ."
"this could be a big year for the <UNK> , so that <#> 's a keeper ."
"i know most bloggers probably are n't big nfl fans , so i 'll try not to rant on that stuff to hard ."
"so i got laid , and <UNK> well if i do so say myself ."
our sex life has got significantly better over the last year .
i think the biggest <UNK> factor is that the <UNK> .
has lost over <#> pounds and gotten into pretty damn good physical shape by working out daily for <#> years and <UNK> hard since the beginning of this year .
"she 's now very <UNK> , <UNK> , looks much better , and is much more confident about her sexuality ."
she 's always been the type of girl that 's up for just about anything sexually but at the same time very shy about the whole thing .
"she 's breaking out of her shell a bit , which is cool , but"
most of all she is just better at it .
"she even went so far as to get her <UNK> pierced a couple of months ago , which has been a lot of fun for both of us ."
"not the <UNK> per say , actually the hood ."
"vertical , for those of you <UNK> in such things ."
"i do n't understand female sexuality , desire , response , etc ."
"i guess that makes me the only man who does n't , right ?"
"i do care , though , but i 've given up trying ."
it 's been an open fact between us since we first started sleeping together that she does n't have <UNK> from <UNK> .
"no big deal for either of us , i take care of her in diverse other ways to make sure we all get what we 're after ."
but she sure the hell seems to like it a lot more than she used to .
"she puts on a good show , i 'll say that much , though she does n't blatantly fake having an orgasm ."
she just puts on a good show of having about as good of a time as i do .
"so , i still do n't think she 's coming , but she 's <UNK> having more fun ."
"we typically start out with her on top , by her choice , which is cool with me because i 'm lazy ."
"she 'll bang me like that for a long time until she tires out , then we 'll usually finish up with me <UNK> her <UNK> style . now"
", i have never claimed to be a skilled lover by any means , but i do n't think i 'm that horrible ."
my first wife was having multiple <UNK> before we split .
"my cock is n't large , but it certainly is n't small either ."
"according to the people who claim to know , i 'm somewhat larger than average but not by much ."
"and she clearly has <UNK> by other means , just not from straight up <UNK> ( i do n't think ) ."
"the fact is , i gave up worrying about it a long time ago ."
"she 's always claimed to enjoy sex and find it very satisfying , but how can it be satisfying if you do n't <UNK> ?"
hence the <UNK> that apparently i am not capable of understanding female sexuality .
"so , is she bs - ing me and just doing her <UNK> duty or is there something there ?"
"bad by our standards , not by the standards of my dear friend the good wife ."
if my wife had <UNK> 's sex drive i would probably not be able to get out of bed to go to work .
though i 'd love to find out for sure . .
"the underlying theme is , help me understand how a sex life could be satisfying if you ca n't have a mutual orgasm ?"
"keeping in mind of course that she almost always gets hers , usually before me , via tongue , fingers , <UNK> , <UNK> , you name ."
"<UNK> too quickly , if i do say so myself ."
"i 'm not a big fan of mondays , especially when i worked all day saturday ."
"i 'm always tired and slightly sick on monday mornings , but today is a hair worse than normal ."
we had a pretty serious scare with my older dog last night and ended up rushing her to the <UNK> emergency room around 9:30 .
earlier in the evening the d. a. wife ( see earlier post ) dumped some hot food coming out of the oven on to the kitchen floor .
"that were <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with several different types of <UNK> , most <UNK> some pretty hot ground <UNK> of some sort ."
"i like my food pretty hot , and we put <UNK> in just about everything we eat , but these were very spicy , even for my taste ."
so the dog proceeds to <UNK> down a <UNK> pile of potatoes that have been out of the oven about <#> <UNK> .
"she 's got a radar for such activities , and the potatoes barely had a chance to hit the <UNK> before they were history ."
"no problem , happy dog , standard practice in our kitchen ."
"about <#> minutes later she <UNK> the whole mess back up again , completely <UNK> ( also very normal ) along with a big puddle of <UNK> ."
"not that unusual , not that surprising under the circumstances ."
"then she <UNK> again , and again , and again , and again , repeat ad <UNK> ."
"she <UNK> about <#> or <#> times in an hour , and that 's very bad news for dog ."
after the first <#> rounds there was nothing but <UNK> coming up - bad sign .
"<UNK> is a fairly normal part of a dog 's routine , but not to that extreme ."
"the last time there was some blood in the vomit , and that always <UNK> an emergency ."
so we frantically call the local emergency vet clinic - we 're lucky to have <#> about a mile down the street .
"my wife talked at length to the vet and was advised to give her another hour and if she did n't vomit again , do n't worry about it ."
"so an hour goes by , no problem , <#> hours no problem ."
"she resting though she 's obviously uncomfortable , so we <UNK> it off to a lingering belly ache ."
"they do n't know for sure what the cause was , but they gave her a shot to settle her stomach and a shot to <UNK> her a bit ."
we have some medicine to give her starting this morning assuming that she 's able to keep some water down .
"so far she seems back to her normal self , but keep your fingers crossed ."
"the bloody <UNK> could be a sign of more serious problems like <UNK> , cancer , or lots of other <UNK> ."
at this point the most likely situation is that the heat and the <UNK> of the potatoes set off the violent <UNK> .
"she was <UNK> and <UNK> so hard that she probably gave herself an <UNK> in her <UNK> , which would be the source of the blood ."
we let her sleep on the floor of our bedroom last night so we could keep an eye on her in case anything happened .
"i was so worried about her that i snapped awake every time she <UNK> or moved around , which was fairly <UNK> ."
"i do n't have any pictures of her hosted yet to share , but i will try to do so later today ."
she 's a very pretty lab and <UNK> <UNK> mix .
"so , that 's why i 'm feeling even worse this monday than most ."
that plus the fact that i am preparing to head to the workplace of the damned .
at least it 's only a half day today .
i 'm getting ready to head in to hell shortly .
maybe i should wear a string of garlic around my neck .
that might not go over too well in cubicle land .
"after the last <UNK> post , here 's a little <UNK> as a follow up ."
many thanks for urllink <UNK> for stopping in .
"i checked out her blog and it 's got some beautiful photos , especially of her original artwork ."
"oh yeah , i did a little update to my profile just for fun ."
i also hooked it up to my msn email so i can start <UNK> to comments by email instead of just on the blog .
"i also have msn messenger , though i have n't used it yet ."
"i 'd love someone to "" chat me up "" so i can figure out how to do it ."
i <UNK> this from <UNK> 's blog because i thought it was pretty funny .
sorry i 'm too lazy to <UNK> it into a more <UNK> form .
"he is only now noticing that wife <#> is also <UNK> child - processes , which are further consuming valuable resources ."
"not only that , wife <#> <UNK> itself such that it is always launched at <UNK> where it can monitor all other system activity ."
"also , system performance seems to <UNK> with each passing day ."
some features he 'd like to see in the upcoming wife
"<#> : <UNK> "" do n't remind me again """
apparently you can not install girlfriend <#> on top of girlfriend <UNK> must <UNK> girlfriend <#> first .
other users say this is along - standing bug that i should have been aware of .
another thing that sucks -- all versions of girlfriend continually pop <UNK> annoying messages about the advantages of <UNK> to wife <#>
if you 've read my previous posts then by now you probably know that i love my wife more than anything ever in life .
"in fact , i do n't think it 's an <UNK> to say that i love her more than life itself . considerably more ."
"however , that does n't mean that she 's not an idiot ."
some shrink or <UNK> guy could probably do an interesting study on the ratio between depth of love to depth of the ability to get pissed at somebody .
"if memory serves , <UNK> <UNK> wrote something very <UNK> to the effect of love fills up the <UNK> <UNK> by sadness ."
"it 's really cool , and if anybody gives a fuck leave a comment and i 'll go upstairs and look up the exact quote ."
"having been through an extremely painful divorce at the young age of <#> , i can certainly <UNK> to the <UNK> of that ."
i 'll work on it and see what i can come up with .
"so , back to the dumb ass wife that i love more than life itself ."
"she will do anything and everything for me all the time , typically before i even ask ."
the more i yell the harder she tries to please me .
"yes , it 's fucked up , but our <UNK> perfectly compliment each other ."
her single greatest flaw ( from my <UNK> ) is that she just is n't terribly reliable .
"i hesitate to use the word "" <UNK> "" because i trust her to the end of the earth ."
"but , i do n't trust that she will ever do what she is supposed to do when she is supposed to do it ."
"too fucking bad , it 's the best i can do ."
"obviously we 've had an "" incident "" to set me off already today ."
"i 've been gone for <#> days , ca n't wait to get home , have a decent evening around the house last night , and"
"then of course , first thing in the morning she 's got to go and piss me off ."
is this isolated incident worth me being as frustrated as i am ? absolutely not .
"however , after <#> years of the same fucking shit over and over , <#> tends to get pretty <UNK> over minor incidents ."
"i was going to try and describe the play - by - play of the whole situation here , but then you would think i was really crazy ."
"suffice it to say that to you it would be minor , to me it 's outrageous ."
i think the real underlying issue is that <#> of the aspects of my personality disorder is that i hold myself to <UNK> high standards .
"accordingly , i hold everyone else around me to equally <UNK> standards ."
i suppose it makes it very tough to be my wife .
part of the way it works in my head is you always shoot for the moon and when you fuck up you learn and move on .
"you do n't kill yourself when you fall short , but you never stop striving to attain your own standards of perfection ."
"i ca n't really imagine being any other way , but it seems that the vast majority of the people out there are n't ."
"and , by the way , everyone i encounter is automatically <UNK> until they prove otherwise ."
she really is very bright and definitely does think more than the average person .
"she 's gotten significantly better in the <UNK> years that we 've been together , but she still struggles with reason at times ."
"maybe it 's because i 'm from mars and she 's from venus , but i would n't know because i do n't read that pop psychology shit ."
i think it 's because she 's an <UNK> .
"i have a hard time with that , but everyone will do it to a certain degree ."
what i really have hard time with is the way she tends to attempt to justify such <UNK> to appear to have a rational thought process behind them .
that statement right there is impossible for my wife to admit .
"it runs in her family , and she 's done an incredible job of breaking away from the mold over the last few years ."
"life was a major struggle for them for years , and they have this kind of an "" us against the world "" mentality ."
"when i first met her there was n't drop of reason amongst the <#> of them , but they 've all grown over the years ."
i think that the <UNK> and <UNK> became standard form around their home growing up to help them not admit how shitty their lives really were .
"that might make you feel better at the time , but in the long run it 's pretty dangerous ."
"my wife is mostly over it , but every now and then she slips back in ."
"her mom , well , you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks ."
"her little sister is better than she has been , but she 's really fucked up ."
the problem with that is that you suffer constantly because things never come out the way you think they should .
"it 's a long , long story that i may explore further at another time ."
"and , by the way , i am absolutely <UNK> to make such <UNK> statements ."
i 'm just passing along my observations and personal opinions about their root causes .
i set out to write about how my wife is an <UNK> dumb ass and all of a sudden i 'm <UNK> her sister 's fucked up personality .
if you 've read this far than you must be as crazy as me .
"i 'm inclined to apologize for the "" rambling "" of the post , but it is my fucking blog after all ."
i really do appreciate you everyone who takes the time to read and post comments .
big thanks to <UNK> <UNK> for her kind words via email .
"if you have n't checked out her blog , check out the link under "" <UNK> show stories "" ."
she used to be a <UNK> show <UNK> and wrote some very interesting accounts of life in that world .
"now she does something different and writes more fiction , coupled with some cool art and other stuff ."
she seems to be a very sweet and sincere girl .
make sure to dig through the archives - it 's very good stuff .
"could somebody please add "" fuck "" and all of it 's <UNK> into the blogger.com spelling <UNK> ?"
"arthur spends the next several years , still wearing his dressing gown , <UNK> launched from crisis to crisis while trying to <UNK> out his lifestyle ."
"he rather enjoys tea , but seems to have trouble <UNK> it in the far reaches of the galaxy ."
"if you have n't checked it out , go right now ."
"for all of you <UNK> ( like me ) , there 's no pictures of her there that i 've seen ."
though admittedly i have n't read through all of the archives . much better - dirty sex stories .
"<UNK> , for those of you that are more artistic about such matters ."
"i , too , enjoy <UNK> , but to me they 're still just dirty sex stories for smart people ."
send her love from me . and beg her to send me a pair of her panties . .
"oh yeah , here 's a picture of my hot , <UNK> member for the good wife <UNK> ok , seriously <UNK>"
"lots of cool bars , clubs , everything right fun right around the corner ."
i sit in my room blogging away . and a shitty room at that .
"day <#> of <#> days of "" training "" is complete , including homework ( seriously ) ."
"it sucked , but it 's far from the worst i 've been to in my career ."
there 's actually some really nice people here from within the firm .
"my roommate , whom i never even knew existed until i got <UNK> with him , is a very cool guy ."
i had dinner with a very nice girl from our legal practice in new york .
"great <UNK> , but i guess that comes with our business ."
i 've also been enjoying the company of the young girl i mentioned in a previous post that i 'm travelling with .
"she 's a sweetie , and it beats the hell out of not knowing anyone ."
"i do n't think the city has been enlightened to the concept of "" customer service "" yet ."
"the attitudes of service workers , <UNK> the ones in this <UNK> hotel , are a god damn joke ."
"and i 'm sure my firm is probably paying a <UNK> of money for the room , too ."
"i got my first comments , and they are from a very cool girl by the name of the good wife ."
she also has a very cool blog of her own .
"i only had a time to read a couple recent posts , but i like it ."
she just posted the online <UNK> 's <UNK> test .
"i do n't want to steal her thunder , but you should definitely check it out ( if you even know what <UNK> 's <UNK> is ) ."
it will help all of you hell - bound <UNK> to see what you 're in for .
"she 's linked on the list down below , too ."
"good wife , you are my first ( and only ) , and we 'll always have that . . ."
<UNK> update - check out the audio of my air guitar solo urllink here
"yes , it 's true , i hate my fucking job ."
i 'm travelling the next <#> days for some mandatory bullshit training for my job .
i 've <UNK> on business for several years and i 've been happy to not be travelling anymore .
suffice it to say that the <UNK> wears off after a couple of years .
not to mention that i 'm not getting paid when i 'm away from the office .
lots of fun for a social <UNK> like me .
"maybe this will prove to be a good opportunity for a little "" remote blogging "" ."
"they 've got wireless access in my hotel , and i 've already <UNK> my tight ass boss into paying the small fee for it ."
i guess i should n't bitch too much - he actually volunteered to pick up the tab for a taxi cab to the hotel .
corporate policy literally requires that i take the public <UNK> train .
"i find public <UNK> to be a bit "" adventurous "" ."
"however , i 'm travelling with a little <#> year old girl that 's never <UNK> on business before ."
"and no , she 's not someone i would bang ."
"not that i 'm not tempted , i just do n't ."
i need to go pack and catch a <UNK> .
"for easy as this blogging stuff is , adding pictures blows in a big way ."
"for whoever is in charge of making this stuff as easy as it is , please spend a little time on the photo side ."
"for those of you just learning how to blog , like me , it 's not that terribly hard , but be prepared for a little bit of html ."
"i do n't know shit about it , but i did figure out how to cut and paste code ."
do n't even bother wasting your time fucking with this hello and <UNK> shit .
"they bill it as "" an easy way to add photos to your blog "" ."
"well , that 's true , but only if you want everything else about your blog completely fucked up ."
do n't waste your time on the download .
"there 's <#> sure fire , easy way to do this and make your pictures stick ."
"since i feel so smart for figuring it out , i 'll share the details here ."
<#> ) find a free place to host your pictures online .
i use <UNK> and recommend it for <#> reasons .
"second , they give you the html tag all set to go"
so it 's a nice easy cut and paste operation .
"actually , make that <#> reasons - they 're free ."
<#> ) go into your blog and type the text in your post that you want to appear before the photo .
<#> ) go to the html editing window for the post .
"do n't worry , you do n't need to understand any crazy , computer looking shit in there you see ."
<#> ) paste in the html tag from the picture that you want in <UNK> .
<#> ) finish your post . <#> ) publish .
a great way to post pictures of cartoon characters flipping off your readers .
"a <#> apologies to anyone who stopped by in the last day during my blog - o - <UNK> "" transition "" period ."
"while i 'm on the subject , ten <#> apologies for this worthless use of server space and <UNK> ."
just think of all of the kids in <UNK> starving for free hosting .
"oh , <#> more blog - o - <UNK> for the record ."
"now that i know how to post pictures , he asked me to send this message to you ."
he 's doing it harder than he 's ever done before . . .
it looks like i picked up another click today .
"still no comments , but we 'll get there soon enough ."
i guess i 'm just not <UNK> enough .
"so it was n't too horrible of a day for a monday , at least not so far ."
i 'm not a big fan of mondays as a rule .
i tend to have pretty good weekends and that makes it tough to head back to the rat race on monday .
"i do n't really hate it either , it 's just there ."
"it 's <UNK> <UNK> enough to keep me engaged most of the time , but not something i can get terribly passionate about ."
"i really should seek out a new career path , but that takes motivation . . ."
"in spite of what my previous , <UNK> posts may have led you to believe , this was n't the worst weekend ever ."
"far from the best , but not too painful ."
i tend to be a real <UNK> - i 've <UNK> a lot of fun things around me so i do n't need to leave home for entertainment .
"also contrary to any impression i may have made earlier , i love my wife and my dogs ."
"we 're both a little fucked up , but our <UNK> compliment each other ."
she 's got major male <UNK> issues and is inclined to try to please everyone all of the time .
"i tend to be extremely , <UNK> demanding and i like to be waited on hand and foot all of the time ."
it works well for us most of the time .
"so how bad do mood swings have to be before you 're technically considered "" <UNK> <UNK> "" ?"
i tend to carefully select like minded ( read fucked up ) people to be around and then build deep relationships .
i 'm not want to <UNK> with <UNK> of <UNK> .
"i do , however , need my significant other around ."
i 'm lucky with my current wife - we have so much in common that it works out well for both of us .
we 're usually pretty happy to just hang out by ourselves with out darling dogs .
"probably , unless you 're a social reject like me ."
"i do n't mean to sound <UNK> , because i 'm really not , at least not any more than any other red <UNK> american <UNK> ."
"i 've had a few good financial years , and i 've managed to get some really fun and cool shit ."
"now that i 'm broke again i 'm glad it 's all paid for , except for the house , of course ."
"given time , we 'll be making plenty of $ again ."
"the income is tight now , but i <UNK> away alot when the getting was good ."
dad raised me to be smart with my <UNK> .
i only need to be worrying about <#> person 's career - mine .
"well , that and my wife 's , but she 's got hers under control ."
"actually , she 's kicking ass and taking names right now ."
"so , back to me not leaving the house ."
"i 'm not totally howard <UNK> or anything , i just really like to chill at home ."
"unfortunately , my most common <UNK> out involve home repair and <UNK> ."
"yes , i do <UNK> frank the tank in that respect ."
it 's just that something is always fucking breaking in this fucking place .
"if not that , we 're <UNK> , or we 're re - <UNK> , or re - <UNK> , or re - fucking something ."
i 'm definitely a <UNK> at home depot and <UNK> .
"this house has n't been updated in , like , centuries , so we 're gradually working our way room by room through the whole joint ."
"fortunately , we can do most of it ourselves so the only cost is the materials and the time ."
"we just completely re - did my studio and , i have to say , it is killer ."
maybe i should develop a post about my new found alter ego . .
i just wrote a long post and managed to lose it without saving .
this fucking monday is off to a great start .
"i do n't have time to re - write now , but i will re - <UNK> the <UNK> point - thank you for visiting ."
"it looks like a couple of people dropped in over the weekend , and i 'm pretty pumped about that ."
"probably they were <UNK> <UNK> , but hey , <UNK> ca n't be <UNK> ."
"i 'd love to see some comments to help fuel interaction going forward , even if they 're bad , so let it rip ."
at least i 'll know that you really were here .
i have to go check out some porn before it 's time to hit the showers and enter that rat race .
this week is going to suck ( do n't they all ? ) .
"i 'm not generally <#> to get super politically involved , though i do tend to hold pretty strong opinions on politics and politicians ."
"probably the single greatest issue for me , in politics and in life , is individual character ."
"that being considered , i feel obligated to pass on a bit of detail about john kerry that 's recently come to my attention ."
"all of his supporters are making him out to be some sort of text book american hero , the <UNK> war veteran and all ."
"based upon this info , i think it 's pretty easy to see that he 's really got only <#> motivation , and that 's his personal political <UNK> ."
everything he 's done throughout his adult life has been specifically carried out with <#> goal in mind - gaining as much power as possible .
"this jackass is all about being powerful , not about being fair , representing public opinion , or making the lives of americans better ."
"he 's been know to do those things , but only when it served his personal goal of gaining more power ."
"he 's lowest form of shit on the face of the earth , a true wolf in sheep 's clothing ."
"sure , he 's made some mistakes , but what president has n't ?"
"check this out , quotes from john kerry 's fellow soldiers during his brief period of "" <UNK> service "" ."
"disclaimer : i do not know these people , i have not collected these quotes myself , i 'm merely passing on information that was recently shared with me ."
"i have no reason to believe it 's not true , but if it is please comment here and i 'll correct it ."
<UNK> john kerry 's <UNK> speak out !
""" we <UNK> very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming back from vietnam in <#> and repeated in the book "" tour of duty ."
""" we think those cast an <UNK> on all those living and dead , from our unit and other units in vietnam ."
"we think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges , and we think that they 're <UNK> ."
we intend to bring the truth about that to the american people .
"we believe , based on our experience with him , that he is totally <UNK> to be the commander - in - chief . """
"it is a matter of his judgment , <UNK> , <UNK> , loyalty and trust -- all absolute <UNK> of command ."
"his <UNK> , ' tour of duty , ' by douglas <UNK> , is <UNK> with gross <UNK> , <UNK> of fact , <UNK> and <UNK> lies ."
his contempt for the military and authority is evident by even a most casual review of this <UNK> .
he arrived in - country with a strong anti - vietnam war bias and a self - serving determination to build a foundation for his political future .
"he was aggressive , but vain and prone to <UNK> judgment , often with disregard for specific <UNK> assignments ."
"that included our soldiers , our marines , our <UNK> , our coast <UNK> , our <UNK> , and our <UNK> ."
"trust , loyalty and judgment are the key , <UNK> words ."
"kerry had thrown on us , and all of our colleagues who served over there ."
i do n't intend to be silent today or ever again .
"if i had , it would have been my obligation to report them in writing to a higher authority , and i would certainly have done that ."
"if senator kerry actually witnessed or participated in these <UNK> or , as he described them , ' war crimes , ' he was obligated to report them ."
that he did not until later when it suited his political purposes strikes me as <UNK> of the worst kind .
they wanted to know if i took part in the <UNK> described .
i do not believe the things that are described happened .
"it was later reported to me that <UNK> ) kerry had fired an <UNK> , and it had exploded off the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i do not recall being advised of any medical treatment , and probably said something like ' forget it . '"
"he later received a purple heart for that scratch , and i have no information as to how or whom ."
today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true .
had <UNK> been committed by us forces in vietnam ?
"yes , but such acts were few and far between . yet"
"furthermore , he suggested that they were being encouraged to <UNK> the law of war by those within the chain of command ."
"james <UNK> , <UNK> ( retired ) "" we look at vietnam ... after all these years it is still <UNK> in isolated poverty and <UNK> and <UNK> ."

"-- <UNK> <UNK> "" in a whole year that i spent <UNK> , i did n't see anything like a war crime , an <UNK> , anything like that ."
time and again i saw american fighting men put themselves in <UNK> danger trying to avoid <UNK> damage .
"when john kerry returned to the country , he was sworn in front of congress ."
"i went on missions with them , and these men served <UNK> ."
up and down the chain of command there was no <UNK> to <UNK> .

i just got an email about some crazy class action <UNK> against <UNK> .
apparently a couple people have filed suit against them based upon a couple <UNK> of the electronic funds transfer act .

"i 've never had a problem with <UNK> , but i 'm also not <#> to turn down free money ."
god i love to see the system at work .
i feel like i 'm making a difference today in cleaning up the brutal <UNK> of the <UNK> . and
a. urllink click here for details and to file your claim !
the purpose of the site is to further the idea of the <UNK> of the human soul .
"to best describe that experience i use the phrase a "" reality <UNK> "" ."
"people often imagine the <UNK> of the soul as some gentle magical experience , when in fact it may be <UNK> in conflict ."
"when the inner person is revealed it is often confusing to those who have known us , it is also confusing to us as well ."
we may not have been real behind the <UNK> however we at least were predictable .
"this conflict is the subject of the movie , the matrix ."
"it is the realization that no matter how harsh reality may be , life behind the <UNK> needs to be rejected ."
"in the movie "" neo 's "" has a <UNK> conversation with a <UNK> "" <UNK> "" ."
"i know what you are thinking , why oh why did n't you take the blue pill ? """
as shocking as this scene is i have asked myself that question a <#> times .
"having our eyes opened is no picnic , the pursuit of what is genuine is at times <UNK> ."
"it was easier when i did n't know , i did n't see ."
"my struggle continues , as i embrace the reality that for me there is no going back ."
"and so i end this post asking a question of you ,"
""" why did n't you take the blue pill ? "" as we walk this out , the <UNK>"
for me it is the stuff that <UNK> me that there is intelligent life on the planet .
"most people do n't like <UNK> , they are labeled <UNK> , or <UNK> ."
they are perceived as trouble makers so their social life is not always as active as those who express extreme optimism .
"even though i am a <UNK> it does not mean i do not believe in anything , nor does it mean i am not optimistic ."
i am committed to what ever it is that i am convinced of .
"i do n't believe everything i read , or everything i hear ."
i think about it for a season and if it checks out i am sold .
"this <UNK> has saved me from spending useless dollars on stain <UNK> , fat <UNK> , and <UNK> up politicians ."
i am skeptical that the world can change all that much in <#> years .
i am skeptical that any <#> person can be elected to an office and really pull off all that they promise .
i am skeptical that people are basically good .
i am skeptical that all <UNK> are evil and i am skeptical that <UNK> to every rule makes me a better person .
my <UNK> has allowed me to find my place in this world .
it has allowed me to ask the right questions .
"i would like to be skeptical of less , i simply think that with every new day i will discover something else to be skeptical of ."
the good news of this is that with every new day i will also be convinced of something as well .
"the christian bible quotes from jesus these words "" be careful how you hear "" ."
this always stood out to me ; i just like the way it sounds .
it implies that it is somehow <UNK> to us if we hear wrong .
that leads to the conclusion that there is also a <UNK> benefit if we hear then hear the right way .
"this seems odd , mainly because it should n't matter at all how i hear anything ."
"i should hear it , get the chance to think about it ."
"if i like it i take it in , if not i reject it ."
"it is why i may shut a conversation down , or walk away from someone ."
"i bring it up because some of you have not learned that dynamic , you need to <UNK> how you hear things as well as what you say ."
"i see you ever day in the congregation of the <#> 's , starbucks arguing about what ever you philosophy might be ."
"you seem "" hell bent "" to convince me of what ever illusion may be suffering from , you ca n't let it go ."
"i have to hear from the <UNK> , the <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> , black hole , political what ever ."
i think that we all like to be victims a little .
we are good at throwing stones but not as good at looking in mirrors .
people are not very nice to christian 's or others of strong <UNK> .
i witnessed a guy who was following this poor guy out to his car .
i would propose that part of the problem of having to argue is driven out of an out of balance defense mechanism .
i think that is connected to what i will call a spirit of offense .
it means i just have to fight about something .
"this is the reason i am suggesting that we need to be careful what we hear , how we hear ."
i do n't need to be offended at what you said .
i do n't have to <UNK> every dragon .
i do n't have to champion every cause .
"my mom used to tell me <UNK> when arguing with stupid people , people watching may not be able to tell the difference ."
"i believe we can live at peace with god , live at peace with others and live with peace with ourselves ."
i used to take <#> kids camping with me every summer .
it started out innocent enough . as a kid growing up in inner city l.a .
i did not have an opportunity to experience nature .
as a matter of fact the only <UNK> i ever experienced was standing around the trash cans they lit in the neighborhood .
for this camping trip we would take as many <UNK> as <UNK> possible .
our truck would be so loaded down that we looked a little like the <UNK> <UNK> .
even with all that stuff we would always <UNK> forget something .
it seemed no matter how prepared we were it was <UNK> .
there are times when i am given to stress all that i do not have .
"it is the nature of compelled humans to <UNK> , as much as it is in our dna to live in a constant state of <UNK> ."
the <UNK> of life seem close in and produce the same sensation as <UNK> .
i have always laughed when i think of the analogy given by douglas adam 's as he helped point to this conflict .
douglas <UNK> that all we really need in life is a towel .
you can even wrap it around your head to ward off <UNK> <UNK> .
"it is not silver or gold , nor car or plane , simply a towel ."
"this same idea that we do n't know what is important can be seen in the scene from steve martin 's "" the jerk "" ."
"in a <UNK> moment his character says "" all i need is this chair "" ."
"these <UNK> help remind us that "" what 's happening "" is often "" not what 's going on "" ."
there is more to it than meets the eye .
"there is more happening around us , we easily lose perspective ."
there is <UNK> to <UNK> the right perspective in the process of <UNK> .
i am often asked why it is that i do not panic over <UNK> .
why it is that i seem to be able to look the most <UNK> dog of the corporate world eye to eye with little fear .
"it is an awareness that my most <UNK> <UNK> is simply human , he has no more power over me than i allow him ."
i see that my most severe trial is only <UNK> .
"i carry a keen awareness that "" this will pass "" and that i really have more than i need ."
"the nature of that awareness and the well of that <UNK> is beyond me , it is most certainly <UNK> ."
"i often speak to <UNK> about this "" luck "" i seem to have ."
if it is coincidence ( and i think it more <UNK> than not ) than may i be on the right side of chance as much as i can .
what this site is not is a matrix fan site .
i want to avoid endless <UNK> to the movie .
"i do not want to see you in your best "" neo "" costume ( as handsome as you might be ) ."
the movie simply serves as basis for the subject .
it is also meant to help people as they begin to walk that <UNK> out .
in my mind i am thinking of people who are in the process of <UNK> themselves .
"they go to the <UNK> a clean - cut icon of the american boy , they return with a <UNK> ."
this is an <UNK> expression of an <UNK> change .
"what they are expressing in doing something this radical is that they are different , or at least perceive themselves different ."
understanding that when something like this happens ; the people that i am intimate with may have something to say about this .
"i might lose my job , or even risk losing a relationship ."
there are always risks when change is present .
this not to foster the myth that this conflict you experience is even worth it .
"the analogy of <UNK> in my earlier post was given to highlight the reality that what we experience may be painful , or even confusing ."
we may lose sight of why we woke up in the first place .
truth does not come in neat little packages .
you can not expect that the truth will even meet you on your terms .
"when truth is presented ( or in my weird view of the world , introduced ) it is something i must react to , something i must <UNK> toward ."
effort is made to <UNK> it into my experience .
"in this sense change is not a natural <UNK> , or evolution but a discipline ."
what has been your experience with the being made aware of truth ?
what change did you have to make as a result ?
urllink today in iraq does n't seem to be from iraq .
the <UNK> goes by the name <UNK> .
"where ever it is from , there is quite a bit of info posted here regularly ."
urllink these letters are from an anonymous soldier does he have a blog as well ? do nt know but will try to find out .
these letters were published at punk planet urllink the devil <UNK> after the fall by jeff <UNK> also found at punk planet .
urllink kevin sites a journalist blogging from iraq .
urllink iraq occupation watch added this to the reference links in the sidebar today .

"urllink regime - building is the central challenge of our time , but surprisingly little is known about how to do so successfully ."
a truth out editorial by stephen d. <UNK>
urllink live from dallas this is the blog of an iraqi woman who lives in the us .
"<UNK> before counting this <#> , as it is n't blogged from iraq ."
this is yet another perspective and also the <UNK> of an iraqi woman .
urllink iraq the model another new <#> .
have been wondering about including in the count overseas journalists blogging from iraq .
my original intention was to record the * new * blogs of people just beginning to exercise their opinions <UNK> .
not quite sure what my decision is on this yet .
"maybe , if i find more journalists blogs i will begin another heading for them ~ as with some soldiers blogs ."
at the moment i 'm only <UNK> the blogs in the iraq blogs links .
<UNK> ! ' been looking for <#> of these for a while ; <UNK> translation tool ; urllink <UNK> urllink <UNK> translation
urllink <UNK> * new * iraq <UNK> blog ( the second iraq <UNK> - blog after <UNK> talking ) new today : <#> total : <#>
"ok , the <UNK> is good now , thanks <UNK> @ urllink active topic"
every time i happen across a new blog that appears to be from iraq i will add it to the sidebar links and count it here in the post .
"<UNK> for quite some time , <UNK> senses an explosion of noise on the verge of <UNK> ..."
"<#> at a time , <UNK> begin to whisper at <UNK> , screens begin to briefly <UNK> ."
"if you listen you can hear these voices , the anguish , the technical difficulties , and voices of support , of debate , from around the world ."
i do not <UNK> the sources of these blogs .
i do not agree with or even <UNK> the content .
"i am not counting soldiers blogs , although links to many of these can be found in iraq blogs ."
"soldiers blogs are another <UNK> in themselves , and i think there are many more then i could even begin to count alone ."
soldiers and military blogs seem to be <#> <UNK> different types .
"the military blog strikes <#> immediately as a <UNK> <UNK> propaganda campaign , while soldiers blogs are more like lone voices in the dark ."
some of the most <UNK> anti - war <UNK> are <UNK> in soldiers blogs .
i would be <UNK> if over time more blogs from <UNK> ex - service people appear .
this brief <UNK> - explanation of <UNK> ( a blog that iraq blog count recently linked ) bought to you by urllink <UNK> .
urllink <UNK> is an <UNK> blog like news feed .
"for example ( today al - <UNK> made <#> demands from the un , in a news conference held at x al <UNK> reported that he is <UNK> ... )"
non of the news items quotes a source nor is their an about me to tell us who the people behind it are .
"a fyi fact , <UNK> means the <#> <UNK> or <#> rivers ."
"iraq is frequently called "" <UNK> al <UNK> "" the country of the <#> rivers ."
urllink future of iraq <UNK> <#> for the reference links .
urllink <UNK> 's journal at urllink <UNK> world wide linking under reference also .
urllink voices in the wilderness as above .
i <UNK> almost sounds like an old <UNK> <UNK> show topic .
"throw in "" and are also in love with your brother "" and then it would be <UNK> <UNK> material ."
the women dressed in the <UNK> crop top and tight jeans with a wide leather belt with some sort of metal <UNK> on it .
my father told me when i was a young boy that there is no such thing as an ugly woman .
"i can remember pointing <#> out when he told me that , but he said that i 'd understand <#> day ."
that day came and i believe that he was right .
but i also understand that they make bigger clothes for bigger people .
fat people ca n't fit into skinny people clothes and if they try the fat just follows the path of least resistance .
"rules to follow : if you look down and can see bottom <UNK> of your shirt and your belly , but not your belt <UNK> ... change clothes !"
"when you 're dressed to go out in public , try sticking your thumb underneath your belt from the top ."
if you have to lift a roll out of the way to do it ... change clothes !
"people are n't looking at you because you look good , they 're looking at you and going """
"what the hell is wrong with you ! ? """
"i 'm not talking about <#> and <#> year old kids , but kids that look to be between <#> and <#> ."
"come on parents , what the hell is wrong with you ? !"
"i wanted to call this blog the <UNK> , but that was already taken ."
a quick look at <UNK> <UNK> revealed the word <UNK> .
i like that word and the <UNK> that you receive upon hearing or saying it .
"i see things on a daily basis that just make me shake my head and say <UNK> or more often "" what the hell is wrong with you ! """
"and so this is the place for my rants and or <UNK> , take them as you will for they may be "" <UNK> "" from time to time ."
why is rap music so popular today ? to be more specific
"okay , <#> <UNK> and a <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> are n't real <UNK> , but are the names so far - <UNK> ?"
"maybe the <UNK> is cultural , or a sign of the times ."
"maybe it reflects the life experiences of a poor , inner city youth who has struggled to leave that harsh existence behind ."
we can no longer understand what they are saying .
"we want to tell them nothing more than to pull up their pants , but we are afraid that they would n't understand us ."
no longer is their language <UNK> with a new <UNK> term here and there .
"it has invaded their writing and spelling , and <UNK> them from anyone who does n't understand them ."
people for whom english is a second language sound particularly ridiculous when that english is <UNK> with ' dis and ' dat and ' yo . but
"then again does any of that really matter , because after all , they will all be huge rap stars <#> day , ' yo ?"
"white kids in their bid for acceptance in the black community have come to be known in that community by such <UNK> terms as "" <UNK> "" ."
"kids in general seem to have no regard or understanding for "" acceptable "" speech and behavior ."
"maybe <#> day "" acceptable "" will change to <UNK> today 's rap mentality standards ."
( make sure to move your hand in <UNK> up and down <UNK> and <UNK> your head to the side to further <UNK> your <UNK> when giving this answer .
this can be observed in that <UNK> are <UNK> in many foreign countries now .
americans are also driven to excess and that is reflected in the urban mentality today .
cultural <UNK> such as bill <UNK> see it happening and condemn it .
"african americans saw this and said , wait a minute ."
"bill <UNK> is <#> of us , how can he say those things ?"
"he can say those things because this is america , and he just calls it like he sees it ."
"white people are n't going to use his comments as weapons against african american society , because the problems are just as <UNK> in white society ."
what the hell is wrong with us ? !
"days that is ... okay , well , there you go ."
is this a good way to kick it all off ?
i suppose it 's as good a time as any .
"actually , it 's a worse time than at any point up until now ."
at least it 's got the potential to be that .
lol sometimes i wonder why they would n't let me write any of the lyrics .
"you just have to remember it was straight ahead rock n roll , wild <UNK> style ."
no <#> wanted to get too deep wit it .
"okay , slow down there buddy ... keep a lid on it for a bit ."
folks is just tryin ' to get ta know ya .
", part is just me bein ' me ( and those are <#> different things . )"
"it does of course make sense to me , and frankly , in my opinion , it 's pretty damn sweet ."
it 'll be a scream .... <UNK> say ?
"and that , ladies and gentlemen , is what they call the hook ."
i 'm pretty sure i 'll be here for a while .
"but hey , right now , i gotta go ."
there are times when certain things happen that <UNK> a rant from somewhere deep inside that absolutely has to get out .
i turned on the tv tonight to <#> of the most <UNK> cheesy programming nightmares ever to throw images against my eyes .
"now , i watch a lot of television , way more than i should ."
you can ask anyone that knows me ; it 's a fact .
"plus , at my core , despite my <UNK> to admit it , i 'm a sci - fi tech - nerd geek ."
point is i 've seen more than my share of cheese .
and it was more than bad : it was <UNK> shocking .
"the display on her father 's computer screen was <UNK> "" heather cam <#> ."
""" the whole thing looked to have been recorded on low quality video tape and produced down at the local independent station ."
"bad lighting , bad cut scenes , <UNK> sets , stiff and predictable dialogue ."
"it was n't a case of "" it was so bad it was good "" that kept me watching ..."
i simply could not believe it had made it on to tv .
"what could this hideous , shoe - <UNK> - together piece of crap be ?"
"ladies and gentlemen , those of you with weak <UNK> <UNK> may not wish to continue , ' cause this is where it got really scary for me ."
"but this thing was on the air for a number of years , was n't it ?"
was n't it even a hit of some proportion ?
certainly it had somewhat of a name - brand recognition .
"what i was seeing was made with seemingly no consideration for <UNK> , budget , thought , or <UNK> ."
did n't this show even have a budget ?
"we cut to an "" on the scene "" reporter , with a video <UNK> of the live <UNK> ."
"this reporter is apparently on a completely different "" scene , "" as she 's in the daylight , standing in front of a building ."
she watches the live feed along with us on a graphic <UNK> .
""" ladies and gentlemen , there she is , this is completely <UNK> "" she tells us ."
why they sent a reporter out to the street to describe the <UNK> instead of having the lead <UNK> at the desk do it is beyond me .
"cut to a bar full of people , <UNK> watching the live reporter 's <UNK> - prize winning effort <UNK> ."
"cut back to walker , still searching the industrial site in the <UNK> darkness ."
"cut to a <UNK> of the <UNK> itself , with the <UNK> victim whispering "" i love you daddy . """
"cut to her father , watching on his laptop , <UNK> the screen gently with his fingers , as if he was <UNK> her face ."
"i ca n't <UNK> enough the very low , almost crude , home video - taped quality this all had to it ."
"cut to the evil tech - nerd terrorist 's <UNK> , which really could have been shot in chuck 's garage ."
"in fact , i 'm pretty sure this is the same footage we just saw of him ."
cut back to the bar full of <UNK> people .
"cut back to the concerned , screen - <UNK> father ."
"man oh man , the tension is really building ."
"cut back to the den of twisted brilliance , where the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> ."
"as he heads for the door , we get a close up of <#> of the <UNK> and see a clock counting down from <#> minutes ."
"with the clock at <UNK> , walker and evil g engage in battle ."
"walker <UNK> <UNK> of <#> kicks to his head , stomach and back , but it 's not enough ."
"the evil nerd - terror tech guy is apparently evil g , oklahoma ranger or something ."
"cut now to a close up of a rifle , which will presumably be fired when the clock counts down ."
"cut to the reporter on the street watching the <UNK> , where the okie and the <UNK> are locked in mortal combat in front of the girl ."
to think that enough people watch this with enough <UNK> to keep it on the air for years ... enough people to make it a hit !
"every year we 're forced fed more of this happy horse shit , and i for <#> started choking on it a long time ago ."
this was the bottom of the barrel for me .
so anyway .... did you guys see friends last night ? a person is ...
"okay , okay ... you can all relax now . here"
i 'll have to add more to this <#> later ...
maybe as my observations about me at <#> occur .
today we 're going to see if perceived dilemma turns into an actual dilemma .
but i do n't really have anything set to say .
nothing i have to get off my chest or anything .
"so this may just turn into a <UNK> , which may not be all that good for business ."
could be especially <UNK> for a <UNK> business such as this .
"on the other hand , some of my best stuff has come "" off the <UNK> , """
so maybe we 'll be all right and the worry <UNK> unnecessary .
all i 'm saying is it 's not a bad thing to hope -- you just ca n't hope instead of do .
it is actually <#> to <#> right now -- and i 'm okay with it . just in case
"remember when you were a little kid , and your birthday seemed to be on par with christmas or something ?"
"like it was your day , and everyone knew it , and acted like it ."
i guess it really does n't make sense to expect that kind of tradition to continue and to be <UNK> into the present day .
adults are way more complicated and <UNK> than that .
"now , none of that sounds too bad does it ?"
"well , that 's because you 're thinking of it as your birthday ."
"if you come from a very rich , <UNK> and <UNK> family , maybe that is your birthday ."
"now i do n't want to get on a big <UNK> here , but no , these days birthdays are not anything at all ."
"i do n't expect to be getting any cash , drugs , blow jobs , or sports cars tomorrow ."
"now i know what i said earlier about "" hope , "" but that hope <UNK> a leak many <UNK> ago ."
i 'll be lucky to even get a card ... maybe from someone at work .
"and so , i 'll go ahead and say it did not turn into an actual dilemma ."
it is a bit <UNK> to publish our <UNK> thoughts for anyone to read .
"might anyone use someone 's thoughts as examples for others to learn what not to do , or think ?"
there are also rewards in sharing with others .
ideas can develop . and a very important <#> is : something tangible is left behind .
a unique contribution that can only be made by <#> individual .
"this is to me , the equivalent of publishing a book ."
it can be a training ground to develop a style for <UNK> what flows from my mind .
click on the title to read about the book of the same title .
"this book talks about the inside story behind the bush administration , and how the planned the iraq war ."
this story is told by an author approved by bush to document what was going on behind the scenes .
this <UNK> is perfect for those who do n't have time to read the book .
this is to further inform about the infamous patriot act .
watch a short <UNK> about the life of george <UNK> by clicking on the title of this comment .
"we should give these companies a message letting them know that if they continue to give jobs outside the country , americans will stop buying their products ."
these companies can sell their products to indians who can now afford them !
the government just issued a higher alert level .
we are now on level high or orange .
i am afraid this might lead to a <UNK> of the elections .
why does n't anyone walk out and demand to get their money back ?
"both of these put to shame the meaning of the word "" patriot "" ."
it is not patriotic to <UNK> the government to get more money for the military .
"the patriot act is another <UNK> , this time , <UNK> by the government ."
it is incredible that we are not doing more about both of these issues and send the message that we are not going to be fooled anymore .
"if abortion is legal , then why is someone who <UNK> a pregnant woman charged with <#> counts of murder ?"
"this is not really by choice , but because they were the only people who asked me out ."
"and i 've concluded that there is a <UNK> <UNK> here , between what i want and what men seem to want ."
"i want to date people my age , for <#> thing - i prefer to talk to somebody with the same cultural references ."
men over <#> in the <UNK> have n't heard of it .
"however , it appears that the only men attracted to me are at least <#> years older than i am ."
"so possibly i can just lose weight to accomplish my goal , but i 'm not sure that is enough to <UNK> the <#> year age difference requirement ."
men in their late <UNK> and beyond almost <UNK> have really bad <UNK> .
"there 's the <UNK> cop haircut , which you can also observe on male members of the <UNK> <UNK> choir ."
"side part , not quite short enough above the ears somehow ."
"or they 're going bald but refuse to cut hair surrounding their <UNK> shorter than the cop haircut , leading to a <UNK> the clown appearance ."
"this is a shame , because women do not object to <UNK> if it is allowed to happen <UNK> ."
"which means cutting what 's left short ( no , do not shave your head ) ."
"keep in mind , <UNK> is just a sign of <UNK> <UNK> and suggests that you can still get it up <UNK> ."
"even worse , there is a segment of my sample population who <UNK> in believing that they look <UNK> <UNK> with long hair ."
"this is <UNK> , and the hair simply makes them look like old ( old ! ) <UNK> ."
"which , of course , they are - and i 'm sure their locks looked fine in <#> ."
"however , long hair is for the very young , and having it can not turn back the clock , guys ."
"if you absolutely must , wear it in a <UNK> that does n't go much longer than halfway down your neck ."
"this can look ok , and is usually matched with <UNK> , a <UNK> and <UNK> . during my dating <UNK>"
", i have observed that these guys <UNK> lie about their age ."
do they really think i ca n't tell just by looking ?
"even if that were n't enough to tip me off , stories about , say , vietnam , will do the trick ."
"the old saw is that women wo n't admit to age , but i 've never lied to someone i wanted to date , at least not about that ."
there does n't seem to be much point - <#> 's years are an <UNK> fact .
"i 've decided to try my hand at the essay form , and figure that a blog is the perfect self - <UNK> way to do it ."
so <UNK> my thoughts to the world is an appealing concept .
"particularly any musings that refer to my ex - husband , my job , and people i claim to have met ."
"on <#> hand we have other lawyers , arrogant lying <UNK> who would sell their grandmother for a <UNK> <UNK> hour spent drinking and/or playing golf ."
other lawyers do many <UNK> and irritating things .
it goes without saying that they lie <UNK> .
"if they think the client will pay their fees , they refuse to settle even if it is obvious that they will do no better at trial ."
they <UNK> <UNK> orders on appeal for the same reason .
"on the other hand there are clients , and let 's face it , they need lawyers for a reason ."
people who are capable of taking care of their business do not typically need lawyers .
they resolve situations as they develop and <UNK> or prevent damage .
they do n't do incredibly stupid things like sign contracts they do n't understand or expect too - good - to - be - true results .
these are not the clients i 'm talking about .
the clients discussed here are typical clients .
the horse is sick ; i give them options and suggest they hire a <UNK> ( me ) .
"they ask how much i will charge , are shocked at my estimated fee , and hang up ."
"they call several more times for free advice . weeks or months later , the horse is dying and and they finally come in ."
"they tell me all about how others <UNK> them and caused the horse to be sick , and often cry ."
"at the meeting , i determine that the horse is now dead ."
i tell them that they will be paying me to bury the horse and <UNK> the smell of it rotting away .
they do not hear me say that the horse is dead .
"they are <UNK> that i will not help them without money up front , and attempt to <UNK> a payment plan ."
"when i refuse to go for this , they <UNK> pay an advance ."
"i explain that the advance fee is an estimate , and that they will have to pay more when it is used up ."
"i explain to them that the courts are slow , and that they must be prepared for <UNK> caused by the <UNK> party ."
"they say they understand and leave , but only in body ."
"in fact , they are still with me via the telephone ."
"they call constantly , and are angry if i do not respond the same day ."
they leave messages demanding faster and more action on my part .
"clients insist on telephone communication because it is not mail , and thus not a potential bill ."
"they fail to show up for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on <UNK> they demanded i file , and i get <UNK> on by the judge as a result ."
"the calls stop when their discovery responses are due , or some other information requirement is imposed on them ."
it is as if they have entered the witness protection program .
"i resort to <UNK> , <UNK> them letters and sending them messages in plain white <UNK> with no return address ."
"i warn them of dire consequences resulting from non - <UNK> ; <UNK> , contempt , <UNK> ."
these activities are followed by <#> of <#> <UNK> .
"if they do n't respond , i eventually send them a notice of intent to withdraw by <UNK> mail ."
"they do n't pick it up , but the judge lets me off the hook ."
"occasionally my <UNK> convince them , and we go back to ( the above paragraph ) ."
"so , back to the question presented , are other lawyers worse than my clients ?"
"i think it comes down to this : you ca n't have sex with your clients - even if you wanted to , i mean ."
"other lawyers are fair game , however , and liquor can even make it seem like a good idea ."
"it is n't , and you will be sorry later , but on that basis the other lawyers are the more <UNK> desert island companions ."
""" ca n't argue that <#> , "" i answered ."
""" have a nice life , "" i told him , and with that i turned and walked away ."
that was the last time i ever saw him .
and i do n't think he 's crossed my mind even once since then . until today .
my sister called tonight with excitement in her voice .
""" did you get your texas jewish post in the mail today ? "" she asked ."
""" did you open it ? "" she asked . "" not yet , "" i answered . """
"you might want to go read page <#> , "" she suggested ."
i went to the kitchen and tore through the stack of mail i 'd placed on the island .
i saw a picture of a guy standing with a <UNK> around his shoulders .
i read the <UNK> and could n't believe my eyes .
"and here he was in dallas , the new senior <UNK> at a huge <UNK> here ."
""" stacey , that 's him , is n't it ? "" she asked . """
the andrew you went to high school and temple with ?
"i remember him <UNK> down the halls , tossing his way - too - <UNK> hair from side - to - side . """
", i wondered out loud as i stared at his bald head in the picture ."
i remember everyone <UNK> over the solo he sang in the senior choir production .
"the song was "" all the time "" and i remember <UNK> when i heard it , thinking that barry <UNK> sang it so much better ."
""" you have n't answered me , "" my sister said ."
""" why did you hate him so much ? "" i could n't answer ."
""" well , <UNK> , since you do n't have a good answer , let 's go to services <#> friday night and welcome him to dallas ."
""" sure he will , "" said my sister ."
all of the sudden the jewish guilt hit me .
all of the sudden he did n't look so self - absorbed .
let 's go to his temple and welcome a fellow <UNK> to our adopted city .
"why the hell not ? "" my <UNK> birthday is just around the corner ."
"the high holy days will be upon us soon , the time for <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"in the spirit of the season , i think this is <#> old <UNK> i am going to bury ."
it was a long drive to work today .
"it was only raining , but you would have thought it was <UNK> the way the traffic barely crawled along at <#> mph ."
"i popped in <#> of my favorite cd 's , "" pearl "" by <UNK> <UNK> ."
"now i have "" bobby <UNK> "" stuck in my head ."
"what a voice , what soul <UNK> had ."
i 've always loved the music of the <#> 's and the <#> 's .
why is it that the best ones had to leave us so young and so often <UNK> ?
i think she was <#> when she died .
"and there are so many others who also <UNK> way too soon ... like buddy holly , <UNK> , <UNK> ray , john <UNK> , karen , and elvis ."
"it really bites , so many songs left <UNK> ."
it just happened again for the 2nd time in as many weeks .
she stopped to sniff the fire <UNK> at the corner house and bam -- i was attacked by the neighborhood frog .
and i do n't like <UNK> jumping on my feet .
""" yes , "" i replied , "" it happened again ."
"you need to keep your frog <UNK> , mister ."
"i 'm tired of him landing on my foot . """
"laughing , he said he 'd never seen a frog in his yard ."
he walked over to where my dog and i were standing .
he asked where it was and i pointed to his bushes and said that it hopped into them .
the <UNK> cast a glow on his face and i could see his eyes roll .
i can tell the man thinks that i 'm a <UNK> .
"oh well , at least my dog did n't shit in his yard as she did when we had the same conversation last week ."
i am always amazed and disappointed at how many adults have trouble with math .
just for fun i thought that i 'd throw out some more problems a function <UNK> ) of <#> <UNK> is strictly increasing <UNK> <UNK> ' )
"> <UNK> "" ) for any y ' and y"
( a ) state the definition of a maximum and a minimum .
"( b ) prove that for any strictly increasing function <UNK> ) , the problems max <UNK> ) and max <UNK> ) ] have the same sets of solutions ."
( c ) show that the problems max <UNK> ) and max <UNK> ) ] have the same first - order necessary and second - order sufficient conditions .
( e ) show that the problems max <UNK> ) ] and min - <UNK> ) have the same first - order necessary and second - order sufficient conditions .
where : <UNK> is a row <UNK> ; c is a <UNK> such that <#> <#> ; and the other <UNK> are as before .
a week from thursday my father is <UNK> <#> operations to fix his broken heart .
he is growing <UNK> by the day and admitted to me tonight that the <#> minutes it takes him to shave in the morning leaves him feeling completely <UNK> .
i do remember <#> day ( and <#> day only ) that my father called in sick to work . and it was not because he was sick .
"when i was <#> , my sister and i begged for <UNK> ."
so he was less than thrilled to arrive home from work <#> summer day to learn that my mother went and bought <#> <UNK> anyway .
"my sister and i quickly lost interest in those fish , but not my dad ."
he came to love them and i will never forget the sad look in his eyes that morning sunshine jumped out of the tank .
so i <UNK> august 26th with <UNK> and hope .
we have been told he will feel like a new man when the operations are completed .
"as a child , i loved going with my mother to the beauty shop when she would get her hair done ."
they seem more <UNK> and relaxing and mellow these days .
the place where i go is actually a spa .
"oh , how i love having my hair done ."
i almost fell asleep when <UNK> was <UNK> and conditioning my hair .
"there is nothing like some good <UNK> , not to mention the free warm chocolate chip cookies they always have ( and i only ate <#> today ) ."
"i like my big hair just fine and after all , i live in texas where everything is bigger ."
how i survived <#> months ( twice ) with no sushi is a complete and utter miracle .
it feels so heavenly to be able to eat it again .
"we had it for dinner tonight and it was <UNK> , especially because we washed it down with warm sake ."
"we got spicy tuna , california and philadelphia rolls , flying fish eggs , salmon and <UNK> along with <UNK> soup ."
when i was <UNK> i would fill a small bowl with soy sauce and add a huge wad of <UNK> and then drink it .
"it was a weak substitute , but satisfied the craving nonetheless ."
"( hey , we do what we have to ) !"
now it 's time to make good on my promise from last night .
give me time to work on my math problems and i am a happy girl .
urllink <UNK> this site here is really cool : urllink <UNK>
"i had a date tonight , but i stood him up and now i feel guilty ."
"oh well , he knows i am bound and determined not to neglect him ."
we have been thru <#> pounds together and only have another <#> to go .
tomorrow is another day and i promised him i 'd give him extra attention to make up for tonight .
""" what do you want to be when you grow up , olivia ? """
"smiling , she replied , "" a baseball . """
""" no , mommy , "" she said <UNK> , "" i want to be a baseball when i grow up . """
"barely able to keep from laughing i said , "" well olivia , you will make <#> awesome baseball . """
olivia was an early <UNK> and has quite the vocabulary . and
i am continually amazed and <UNK> at the insights and thoughts she shares with me .
olivia and nurse mommy were playing hospital with all of her stuffed animals .
dr . olivia asked me to get the <UNK> out of the medicine chest .
with an air of <UNK> she placed it in the mouth of <UNK> the dog before <UNK> that <UNK> was sick with a fever of <#> and the <UNK> .
"she stood up , put her hands on her hips and said <UNK> , "" no mommy , i will be a baseball when i grow up ."
"giggling , she put her little arms around my neck and said , "" good . """
we went on saturday mornings and it meant that my sisters and i each got to choose a <UNK> <UNK> and a bottle of pop .
this was before the plastic <UNK> bottle era -- back when people used to return glass pop bottles for <UNK> .
"( <UNK> , i am dating myself ) ."
"with the exception of the occasional ho - ho and ding - <UNK> , could anything be better than <UNK> - q 's ?"
"i think not ! and did anyone ever really buy and eat those gross pink , coconut - covered <UNK> things ?"
i have fond memories of shaking every italian salad dressing bottle i could reach and ballet dancing down the <UNK> .
"when my sister was little , she would sit in the front seat of the cart and we would "" cruise "" down the <UNK> ."
tonight i took my own daughters to the grocery store .
i think my kids find it as magical as i did .
"samantha is just a baby , but is <UNK> by all of the lights and bright colors ."
"and olivia has her favorite <UNK> , too , like getting a <UNK> ."
"chip cookie at the <UNK> counter , hanging out by the lobster tank and charming the <UNK> dude into giving her some roast beef ."
my daughters had fun at old tom thumb tonight and so did i -- especially because my <UNK> sunset rose
tea was finally <UNK> and i discovered a new cereal ....
"<UNK> 's <UNK> -- like <UNK> <UNK> , only <UNK> 's ."
"and when no <#> was looking , i grabbed a bottle of wish bone italian and shook it to my heart 's content ."
it 's good to see the <UNK> up so strong today .
the past few weeks have seen a dip again and i tire of seeing my <UNK> decline .
"i used to have a <UNK> , but all of his picks were <UNK> so i dumped him and started using <UNK> ."
i have done much better <UNK> our money than he ever did .
"my sisters and i would nod , but deep down we questioned this wisdom ."
"but , as with so many other things that she told us , we look back now and realize grandma ralph was right ."
"so here it is , my very first blog entry ."
i am officially on my lunch hour right now and am eating some <UNK> japanese food and trying to force down some vegetables .
"if i never ate another veggie , i would n't miss them ."
meat is where it 's at -- it 's beyond me how anyone can be a vegetarian .
i 've had <UNK> for the past couple of days .
the <#> i have now is trying to go away .
guess i just need more sleep to get rid of it .
sleep - it 's what i do best .
"don't ask my why , i just have ."
i need more therapy especially since i have n't gotten any over the past year .
technically it all goes back to being adopted .
it 's been no picnic even though people think i 'm so blessed to have been wanted by a family .
"well , the family that adopted me took me just because they wanted another baby - a girl - in their family ."
they did n't pick me for me ; they picked me because i was a baby .
i do n't fit in with my family at all and you can tell that just by looking at me .
i 'm so irish - looking that it 's not funny whereas the rest of my family is all darker hair with darker skin .
i 'm so much more vocal than they are .
especially my <#> brother - the other adopted child .
he 's so passive and such a mama 's boy that i ca n't stand it .
and he hates me for all the <UNK> i put up .
he once told me to go to hell in front of my parents and they did n't <UNK> him or anything .
mom has always sided with my <#> brothers .
i was the trouble - maker and they were the <UNK> boys .
i 'm angry at my <UNK> for giving me up .
i know he enjoys learning and getting an education but he barely has time for life now let alone if he 'd go back to school .
"what 's going to happen to me , is all i 'm wondering ."
i know i should n't complain because i 'm going back to college in september but my classes will be easy compared to his <UNK> .
i asked him about it and he said nothing will change but ..... he ca n't promise that .
sometimes i wish i was n't so afraid to tell him how i really feel about him .
i 'm too afraid of being pushed away * and * pushing him away with what i might say .
"in my dreams , i always hope that i 'll be able to open up to him and that he 'll accept me ."
so i was looking in the sunday paper and of course i read the <UNK> .
i found out that earlier this week a woman i had worked with passed away .
i worked with her at an insurance agency and for the most part i liked her and got along with her .
she had cancer and she died at home .
it 's funny because i was thinking about her earlier this week .
i actually thought of giving her a call even though i had n't talked with her in years .
she <UNK> many lives and she will be very missed .
"whenever someone i know of dies , i feel such a strong loss ."
i know that part of the reason that i feel so strongly is because i sort of envy those people who have gone before me .
they are finally resting at peace and that 's what i long for .
"i believe in heaven , and i believe heaven is a place of beauty as well as a <UNK> e where there are no more hurts ."
i imagine it is a place where there are no <UNK> made of others that are there .
i so long to be free of <UNK> .
i guess that 's all i 'm going to write for now .
i do n't want to get into things any deeper than with what i 've already said .
i 've been fighting sleep lately and tonight is <#> of those nights where i 'm doing just that .
"of course , it does n't help that i spent most of today in bed ."
i was so tired today and i think i 'm getting a cold .
my cable got turned off today so that 's also most likely contributing to my lack of being able to sleep .
i was told by my roommate that he paid bills but it seems they have n't been paid in <#> months .
i 'm learning i ca n't trust my roommate .
my roommate is my husband although we are separated .
it was just easier for both of us to continue living together for financial reasons .
"strange relationship maybe , but it works for us ... for now ."
"he just got a job and starts on monday so hopefully after some time , we can begin our divorce <UNK> ."
my boyfriend is an attorney and he 'll probably do our divorce for us for just the court costs .
i feel so bad that my marriage did n't last a lifetime but what can you do when <#> people simply grow apart ?
"i will always care about my husband , though ."
"you do n't live with someone for <#> years and just stop caring for them , you know ?"
i do n't care too much for my roommate 's girlfriend .
"she 's a big dumb blonde who is goofy looking , at least that 's why my boyfriend says about her ."
"she goes through money like it 's water , and she spends even when she should n't be spending ."
she treats my roommate like shit sometimes and i let him know when i think she 's doing that to him .
he 's too good of a guy to be treated the way she treats him at times .
"so , m , my boyfriend is an attorney ."
"and , he 's also my daddy and i 'm his submissive ."
i treasure my relationship with him very much ; he 's been a wonderful gift in my life .
"hopefully after the first of the year , we 'll be living together ."
"at least , that 's when i told him i wanted to be out of here by - the first of the year ."
m and i live <#> <#> hours away from each other which is n't that bad .
"i like the drive out to where he lives and compared to where i live , there is so much more to do where he is ."
i worry about him everyday and i look forward to our <UNK> talks on the phone .
sometimes i wonder if i tell him that i appreciate him enough .
i want him to know how special he is to me but i do n't want to <UNK> him at the same time .
i guess i 'll try to go back to sleep now .
this journal is only going to be shared with <#> people - <UNK> and <UNK> .
i have been <UNK> to them for the longest so they deserve to know exactly where i am .
i am <UNK> and will be moving closer to my goal weight over the next <#> weeks .
"i 've made the next mini goal of losing <UNK> in the next week , another <#> the week after , and <#> whole <UNK> the week after that ."
"i was going to settle back and not worry or care whether i do or not , but that has n't worked for me ."
is to pretend that i 've just started again .
so now i need to get off the computer and do some work and will journal again tomorrow .
well i made it here and love the site .
i started my own yesterday but i do n't know how often i 'll get to use it with helping <UNK> finish the house .
what are they going to do to you on monday week ? !
that 's pretty quick work by your doctor .
must go as i have no idea how this works :-)
i 'll follow it up with an email .
it 's been a very busy and somewhat hectic last couple of days .
<UNK> and i made a rush trip into <UNK> yesterday to see a specialist for me .
"it looks as though i will be having surgery on monday , august 23rd ."
but i should be well enough to travel on september 15th .
<UNK> and i have been <UNK> talking about and planning our trip to america .
i 'm really hoping that we will be able to do some of the simpler things like see an <UNK> basketball game and a major league baseball game .
but what ever happens it will be a great trip .
"i 've been doing really well at keeping a food journal , but i just have n't posted it here ."
i 've been working really well at keeping my water consumption up as well .
"i have finally gone back to <UNK> , i finished my first lo yesterday ."
i was so happy to have done it .
i think it 's going to go back to just <UNK> some time every other day or so for my <UNK> .
i wonder if it 's the same for everyone ?
"does everyone schedule things like <UNK> , meditation , gym , reading , ect time for themselves ?"
or am i an odd ball in that respect ?
"the best thing about having <#> <UNK> is that no day is ever the same , or ever boring ! !"
today jimmy actually slept in until <UNK> <UNK> i was so surprised !
"but since he has stopped taking day time <UNK> , he is starting to go to bed by <UNK> ! !"
"mike got himself off to school as usual and <UNK> and i played "" your on my last nerve , mate ! """
"unfortunately , he ended up walking to school again today ."
i 'm very happy to say that my house is looking quite nice ! !
jimmy and i headed off to get the mail and to go to <UNK> .
i was lucky enough to get an invite to a friends house and have lunch with her .
"i was beautiful , the lunch and the company !"
this is what he has been looking forward to all year .
his dad and i have decided also that it is the best thing to send him to a boarding school starting next year .
we feel that perhaps he is feeling quite bored here in <UNK> .
he is actually said that he thought it would be a good place to go !
honestly i thought that only mother 's who could n't be bothered to raise their children sent their children to boarding schools .
but i 'm beginning to see it as an opportunity now .
so i 'm going to head off to bed .
perhaps someday i will be able to write something really in depth !
today was another full blown day for us here in the <UNK> household .
i got up at <UNK> which is really unusual for us .
we had breakfast as the boys were heading off to school .
i 'm looking forward to getting that finished as i know <UNK> is as well .
we are both excited and <UNK> about going over .
"i 've started reading "" the seat of the soul "" by gary <UNK> ."
it 's really interesting and <UNK> me in to alot of things that i thought might be happening !
i went to the doctor today and it looks like i may have to have surgery before i go to the usa .
"it 's to help with heavy <UNK> as well as pms ( pass me the shotgun , lol ! ! ! )"
my family is really good about dealing with this ...
"today i spent the morning moving the furniture around in the living room , <UNK> and cleaned and <UNK> like mad ."
we are trying to get some additional help for <UNK> with his school work .
we then came home and started the evening routine .
i enjoyed myself quite a lot by watering the yard and clearing the driveway of all the grass that is taking over the drive .
"my muscles are a bit sore in my arms , but i really enjoyed getting out of the house and getting my heart pumping !"
"<UNK> cooked supper , a nice lovely chicken and <UNK> <UNK> , as i did n't feel very hungry i could n't be bothered to eat much ."
"the kids had a good day today , jimmy enjoyed going to play down at adrian and <UNK> place for a few hours while <UNK> and i were away ."
"since adrian and <UNK> 's <UNK> are so far away from them here in <UNK> , jimmy quite often get treated like <#> of their grand kids ."
"well , here is my dr phil journey part of my <UNK> ..."
"water snack : <#> orange , <#> coffee water : <#> <UNK> <UNK> all !"
i 've found that i am very motivated to get things done before we go to the usa .
"i 'm really hoping to get so much more done before we go , i 'll post changes to the house as i go !"
i also got the chance to go around and see <#> of my lovely friends .
"<UNK> , i met her about a year and a half ago at a birthday party to another friend ."
"since then , getting to know her has been a real joy ."
"she is originally from russia , and also <UNK> here about <#> years ago now i believe ."
"she is also married to an australian and has a new baby , who is just beautiful !"
she has been really helpful and has <UNK> me in my attempts to learn russian ! !
she has also become <UNK> in english since she has moved here and has done so well !
he has always been <#> of little words but big plans .
i just have to learn to be patient some times and go with the flow ( sometimes ) !
how did i do with my dr phil challenge 's this week ?
", i was a bit naughty at lunch and ate a pie ... and then for supper we had <UNK> and salad ."
i know that i need to do better tomorrow and drink more water as i had <#> <UNK> today .
"well here i am again . my first official post on my new blog , my hope to stay in touch with everyone ."
after they left i enjoyed myself by watching a movie .
i have n't done this for a very long time .
"after that i hung out laundry , did a few choice chores and enjoyed myself reading ."
so what have i been doing with myself lately ?
"well , i 've started several different <UNK> ."
i 'm really excited about this because my spirit and mind really does deserve a healthy body .
i 've also started <UNK> about <#> years ago now ...
i find <UNK> very <UNK> as i can journal about different times and events in my life .
"i 've also started reading several different works by <UNK> <UNK> , as well as several other authors ."
"for my partners in the journey with dr phil , here is my food diary ."
"also , i 'll be doing a live cam session every now and again , so stop by and see what i 'm up to !"
i 'll fill you all in on that a bit more in the near future ...
trouble with english summers is that this makes outdoor events somewhat of a <UNK> .
"today , however , was a day for tea , <UNK> , jam and cream ."
"a truly english , and very conservative , <UNK> event ."
it is when you attend events such as these that you realise that this <UNK> that i am fighting really is conservative .
back to the tea - weather held off and much chat about the weeks by - elections .
had a meeting this evening with some residents in <UNK> who back on to the <UNK> behind <UNK> road .
they have a legitimate complaint that the <UNK> are an absolute mess . but the problem is worse than that !
great day in london as a tourist on a tourist bus with family .
no sure if anyone caught this on the news yesterday but whilst this initially sounds like a good idea you can not help worrying about some aspects .
urllink elderly <UNK> to take in <UNK> . as it is i sometimes wonder if this would not be a better thing for students rather than the unemployed .
the unemployed want a job and students are frequently <UNK> <UNK> rented housing that could be used for others .
we also have urllink ' a ' level exam results .
for once i am going to agree with some of what david <UNK> says .
it is a great shame that every year exam results come out we <UNK> the <UNK> of the students .
maybe that always happened but many think not .
the simple fact is that the world and the skills needed to succeed in the world have changed .
"frankly , if the exams we are asking children to pass now are not different or improving then they should be ."
"students today have an <UNK> of tools available to them that were not there even ten years ago - computers , the internet etc ."
schools have changed and students are changing as well .
no ; but it probably means that the exams and the <UNK> need to change .
it may mean that we need to see the sort of <UNK> of exams that took place with the <UNK> <UNK> .
"however , i am very worried about an <UNK> conservative government wanting to <UNK> more <UNK> on education ."
not that it does not need it but change brings uncertainty and this government has spent its entire period in office <UNK> and changing education .
today is my youngest daughters birthday - she is <#> .
fortunately as she is <#> whether it is here today or tomorrow hopefully will not scar her for life !
"urllink the party announced a new policy on the <UNK> , ending the attacks that are <UNK> being launched ."
"in return he gets <UNK> road <UNK> , road <UNK> and <UNK> status !"
had a fun evening with a <UNK> of conservatives in <UNK> .
they had been particularly active during the times when we made a clean sweep in <UNK> and took all the council seats there .
lots of questions and answers on policy and what the party needs to do to get themselves into a position of winning the next general election .
most exciting aspect is that they all want to participate in <UNK> and help out .
this means a starting team of <UNK> in <UNK> !
urllink the party announced it 's policy on phone <UNK> .
phone <UNK> are a running sore in local government .
whereas <UNK> get to decide planning applications for almost everything else because of some <UNK> they do not on phone <UNK> .
phone <UNK> cause the most public concern because of their association with health problems etc .
there is a building on the <UNK> near <UNK> that looks <UNK> with about a dozen of these things stuck on top and with no attempt at <UNK> .
"in this world nothing can be said to be certain , except death and taxes ."
"benjamin franklin , letter to jean - <UNK> le roy , <#> <UNK> ."
<#> according to the urllink shadow <UNK> this is becoming more and more true under this government .
in places like <UNK> it is beginning to have a serious impact on the <UNK> that we leave our children .
the simple problem is that the <UNK> tax <UNK> ( the sum at which we get charged ) has obviously not been rising as fast as house prices .
in <#> only <#> <UNK> in the country had average house prices that qualified for <UNK> tax ; today there are <#> .
this whole issue of course links to <UNK> general election commitment not to raise income tax and yet still pay for the massive investment in public services .
instead of income tax rising all the other taxes have had to rise instead and the most painful has been council tax .
"now of course the <UNK> <UNK> will jump up and down and say "" local income tax "" ."
will it not merely lead to only the low earning and the very rich living in <UNK> ?
my fear is that it would squeeze out the families we want to see live in <UNK> .
"in any case there is a difference between having "" the ability to pay "" element in any <UNK> and the need for local income tax ."
remember there was no pain in council tax before this government came to power .
i think there is probably an issue over who wrote the death and taxes quote first .
"whoever it was did not , i imagine , believe that taxes beyond the grave would be higher than those this side of the grave !"
finished up delivery in a few roads in old <UNK> this morning and then took children out to richmond park to let them run off some energy .
great walk around the <UNK> <UNK> ; another great park on our door step .
my grandmother loved the <UNK> <UNK> and it would have been her <UNK> birthday today .
noticed for the first time the new <UNK> speed limit in the park .
firstly a car going <UNK> takes longer to go through the park and therefore spends longer in the park <UNK> .
secondly i have to tell you that going at <UNK> there must be a greater chance of losing concentration and just staring out the side window whilst driving .
it is so slow it almost seems like a toy town ride .
also dropped into the korean fair on the <UNK> this afternoon which seemed <UNK> and very food <UNK> .
"still , food is where most cultures meet !"
this evening we took our french guest ( linda ) out to dinner as she leaves tomorrow - escaping the mad house that is the davis ' .
been good to have her here and good for the children to have an extra pair of hands to distract them .
finally there was a very interesting radio <#> ( own <UNK> )
urllink they posted it on the bbc website .
quite a slow day really catching up with paperwork and <UNK> stuff that <UNK> around you .
always leave it till august when i supposedly have more time to put all the information together .
have a catch up for you on my blog about the urllink <UNK> <UNK> .
it would seem that pressure is beginning to pay off .
trouble is someone has now decided to dump a tree they have cut down .
remember this was where last year the council ran an action day for the residents to clear up the area around their homes . having cleaned it up
the residents think that given how much tax they pay this is <UNK> and it should not be for them to go around clearing up public spaces .
this evening spent another <#> hours <UNK> to homes around the <UNK> .
it also mentions the al <UNK> <UNK> that his son and diana were killed as part of some conspiracy .
this is tough but surely the time has come to let this rest .
but there is also the fact the you have to move on and however much you may want to bring them back it will not happen .
on a lighter note have you seen the story about the urllink mcdonald 's happy meal that comes with a free <UNK> .
apparently they have been overwhelmed with the demand and have had to order more .
very interesting that it takes a private company to implement the government 's objective of healthy eating !
makes you wonder who has the real power ?
finally i gather that spending on education has <UNK> by urllink <#> % since the mid <#> 's .
if this is the case exactly where have standards <UNK> by <#> % ?
if this is the case then why are schools <UNK> suffering as bad as they are ?
why are schools about to suffer a crisis in their it <UNK> ( as they tell me they are ! ) ?
the alternative is that spending on education <UNK> out of control with no <UNK> benefit .
seems like the police theme is going to last right up to the next election .
spent some time today out on a ward <UNK> with the safer <UNK> team .
it was a fascinating time discovering potential issues around the <UNK> station and walking through virtually unknown <UNK> off <UNK> hill park .
also looking at the problem of the green triangle at the end of <UNK> drive .
<UNK> many of the local issues are low level and involving young people and clearly there is a big job for the police in engaging with this problem .
"i am confident that our police , despite all the <UNK> , are doing as well as they can ."
release them from the <UNK> of <UNK> and do away with the <UNK> of <UNK> and who knows how law and order in our communities might be transformed ?
i noticed that today the government tried to spin the law and order debate back their way by <UNK> another new idea .
"i have been promised new lights , signs and some new cleaner <UNK> <UNK> as a way to improve the environment around the site ."
i shall keep my eye on this <#> ! spent a couple of hours <UNK> this evening –
our new <UNK> commander is a change for the <UNK> .
she seems very focused on the problems we as a <UNK> face but is also open to new suggestions on how <UNK> can be improved in the <UNK> .
she is also experienced in <UNK> having worked here before .
whichever way you put it the police have an impossible task .
at the same time they are expected to put more police on the streets to tackle anti social behaviour and fill in more forms at the same time .
which is i suppose where the urllink michael howard speech comes in .
it is frankly incredible that from march next year the police are expected to fill out a form every time they stop someone
is a form the only way we can be sure that the ethnic minority groups are not being stopped more than others ?
in any case there is a vast difference between ' stopping ' and ' searching ' .
currently if the police ' search ' someone they do need to fill out a form and this would continue .
what the conservatives are against is <UNK> this form filling to every time an officer ' stops ' someone .
<UNK> of course the government jumps up and down and screams about it all and how <UNK> can not possibly afford this - which is total <UNK> .
given how much <UNK> has <UNK> in this country and how much this government is spending of our money it is a nonsense .
"i say "" cut the forms and keep the police "" ."
well once again they managed to condemn the whole thing as a urllink disaster clearly <UNK> they think filling out forms is a good idea .
"more forms , no more police except they might offer ' <UNK> ' jobs for those <UNK> retirement to stay on longer ."
we have had this silly approach for too long .
we hear so many stories of the rows and <UNK> within the local <UNK> <UNK> that we have lost track now .
still a good platform is building for us to fight the local elections in <#> years time .
as rain held off did some <UNK> this evening into the <UNK> ward area .
we are getting a pretty good response over there for what was a pretty solid <UNK> dem area once .
clearly things are improving for us <UNK> even though the polls are not moving <UNK> .
some delivery this morning and then entire family round to lunch - brother from manchester and youngest brother and wife from <UNK> .
"spectacular day , threatened all sorts of rain but came to nothing ."
exhausted at end of it but good to get family together more than once during a year .
real <UNK> though - we all support <UNK> but .... there must be a better way of doing it .
perhaps if the door to door <UNK> was better we would not need these static sites ?
bit too hot to do things quickly today . attempted a fast delivery of <UNK> around <UNK> ward and then felt too hot .
took the children out cycling through <UNK> park and back along river and then a slow evening .
<UNK> lots of <UNK> and parties will be trying to grab this as their success .
fact is there is a lot of ill feeling surrounding fireworks and their <UNK> if not dangerous use .
but give them each seperate <UNK> times does seem a little <UNK> .
"still , i am sure we all believe that our <UNK> 's know what they are doing ! !"
i am sitting here watching the closing moments of big brother .
politicians moan and complain about how they wish they could get as many people interested in politics as they are in big brother .
the fact is of course that <UNK> do not really put themselves on the line in the same way the <UNK> of bb do .
"open , naked honesty can not ever suit some politicians - especially the naked bit !"
but there is a difference between honesty and blatant <UNK> that gives politics and politicians a bad name .
the <UNK> <UNK> have claimed that they want to give all elderly people in england free personal care .
"in fact a <UNK> dem <UNK> called <UNK> has said : "" britain ’s elderly should receive free personal care , <UNK> by <UNK> criteria ."
in fact they might charge up to £ <#> per week for those with most savings and the highest need for care .
"this is outrageous , but not only am i outraged but so is age concern <UNK> and the <UNK> centre for independent living ."
a centre that they might move again in a few years - what happened about caring for people !
", i am not <UNK> this , but <UNK> should make people angry ."
so what are they going to do with the big <UNK> house at the end of this series ?
maybe there are some <UNK> that ought to spend some time there and get to know what real people are like !
maybe being publicly voted out of office for the way they behave in the house might <UNK> up their acts a little ?
clearly not as <UNK> as it must have been at the fa board meeting today !
i noticed today a wonderful example of <UNK> dem nonsense .
they attacked the conservatives for arguing that some police forces were reporting that they would have funding <UNK> by the end of the year .
<#> such chief <UNK> on the today programme this morning agreed with this .
and yet the <UNK> <UNK> manage to argue that our policy to have <#> extra <UNK> is half baked but then not put forward an alternative .
.... urllink <UNK> <UNK> have no policy on police force but i will tell you what really worries me about this governments and <UNK> strategy for police .
i actually think the new <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> officers per ward ) is very good
"the new <UNK> 's are great people <UNK> a difficult job but ..... they are not police officers , having no powers of arrest ."
so i have a bit of an idea about the problems they face but as he says
the irony is that this type of <UNK> we were doing <#> years ago ! !
yet more <UNK> tonight which worked up a sweat .
having the young girl from france staying i decided to take my wife to dinner and leave the children behind .
"went to a great restaurant called ' the italian taste ' in victoria road , <UNK> ."
what a day ! had a very good business meeting this morning and really <UNK> out the future development of education .
for those who do not know i run an education charity and
"<#> of the projects is how we can really use technology , in a <UNK> way , to transform the delivery of education - no small agenda ."
sadly though not an agenda this government gets because change <UNK> on <UNK> to <UNK> head teachers rather than the over <UNK> <UNK> of labour .
the young french girl staying with us also took her first visit to london .
"our city is apparently "" big "" , "" exciting "" and the "" best place in the world "" ."
we cynical british sometimes forget the <UNK> we have in london .
"despite all the problems of mayor <UNK> , and the <UNK> he will send over the next <#> years , this is a great place to live !"
did you hear the monstrous wash up from my article about the rain and delayed trains ?
have the government been to increase house numbers in london that they have built like mad without attending to the infrastructure issues that are inevitably there .
my view is it is about time the developers started paying <UNK> to pay for the extra <UNK> and <UNK> required to <UNK> these homes .
if developers do not like it then do not build the homes .
rail <UNK> was a disaster and the last conservative government made a mistake .
it was not a mistake to <UNK> it but it was a mistake to use the method they did to <UNK> it .
i feel <UNK> to keep all my residents completely informed of where the best information can be found for the coming election .
are they saying we now need to introduce an equal <UNK> movement for men ?
spent a <UNK> hot day at work and then an even hotter couple of hours <UNK> more <UNK> - nothing <UNK> about being a <UNK> candidate .
"but that is not just about holding special <UNK> at which few turn up , but also continuing to knock on doors ."
lots of <UNK> to catch up on so another late night <UNK> .
i wonder why pink is the color for breast cancer ? is is because most victims of breast cancer are women ?
because it is the color of your eyes from the date of <UNK> til who know when ?
because it is the color your skin turns after days and days of continuous <UNK> <UNK> ?
black could be dressed - up or dressed down .
"<UNK> matter what top you wore , put on a black top ..."
<UNK> matter what color or pattern pants you were .
"black was easy , black was comfortable , black was "" safe . """
the color i once thought stood for <UNK> and weakness and <UNK> .
i realize i am drawn to it as i never thought i would be .
ones that share my <UNK> of pink and unity and optimism .
"optimism that maybe , just maybe pink will again remind us of <UNK> , not breast cancer"
"technically that makes him an adult , honestly , that still makes him my responsibility and it 's a big <#> !"
"high school graduation , college , college graduation ( hopefully ) , a career , marriage , children ."
i want the best for him and fear that i will not be able to give it to him .
"he will have to work hard , very hard ."
"i will try with all my heart to do as much as i can , but it 's going to be up to him to make it through ."
"i want him to have more than i had , to have more than i was able to give to him ."
to live his life to the fullest and love every waking minute of it .
to find someone wonderful to share it with and to just be ...... happy !
"not only do i want these things for him , but i pray that i will be around to see them ."
"he may not have had everything a child could have wanted growing up , but he was never short on love !"
i hope he knows and will always know that .
"things may not have always been good , or always gone the way he wanted , but he was loved more than any child could ever be loved ."
"i miss my little boy , but i really enjoy being with the young man he has grown up to be ."
just a short post today as i m rushing about getting ready to head up to manchester for a bit .

the website is almost complete and once it has the ok from ken and the other <UNK> guys it will go live at urllink
"<UNK> huge thanks to dave my other half for that , when it comes to web design he s second to none :) ."
urllink i do not <UNK> a deer every season .
"by that , i mean that each year i hunt for a buck that is "" better "" than the last <#> i took ."
i 've never seen a cool non - typical or otherwise odd deer yet .
i once went through a <#> year dry spell -- letting lots of good legal bucks walk .
i was hunting in an area that has very <UNK> <UNK> .
"i could see this deer 's body , and i could tell that he was quite a bit heavier than the previous <UNK> i had taken ."
"but because of the heavy cover and <UNK> , i could only get tiny <UNK> of his <UNK> ."
he went down in his tracks and never even kicked his legs .
"i learned later , when i was cleaning him , that i had made a direct hit through the heart ."
"i was a little disappointed when i got to him and saw that he was an <UNK> , but he was still a nice buck ."
he <UNK> away into the <UNK> without offering me another shot .
"that s why i like hunting , i guess .... its full of <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ..."
but there is also always the off - chance something remarkable is going to happen .
"well , i did not have any cell service in the white river national <UNK> refuge , but i do now ."
"we are at our usual deer hunting property in <UNK> county , ar ."
"we had a great trip this morning at the refuge , hiking miles into the <UNK> ."
marked <#> good stand sites on the <UNK> and then headed back out .
it is about <#> pm now and we have a lot of work to do before dark .
"hot , <UNK> , humid , back - breaking work ."
"it is there , in the remote reaches of the <#> <UNK> refuge , that we are going to scout for locations to hunt this fall ."
we are going to mark the locations we plan to hunt on the <UNK> and then hike back out .
"after that , we will make the <#> <#> hour drive from the refuge to our usual hunting grounds to do our chores ..."
we hope to make it there by <#> pm .
"if we do not get there by then , we 'll be finishing up our chores in the dark before heading home ."
its going to be a long day ... but worth every second of it .
"if i am able to get service in the wilderness , i 'll blog in from the refuge ."
"i 'm pretty sure i 'll have service from our regular deer camp , so i 'll send a test blog with any news from there as well ."
only a few more <UNK> after the <#> <#> inch <UNK> .
i am guessing he weighed well over <#> pounds .
its <#> pm now and i am heading for the marina .
not another soul out here as far as i can tell .
"i am sitting in my boat right now , on the lake by my house , writing this on my <UNK> ."
"it is an amazingly beautiful night , especially for an august night in arkansas ."
it is probably <#> degrees with no humidity whatsoever .
"i have only caught <#> small bass so far , but who cares ?"
"the sun is setting now , and the <UNK> are heading their <UNK> boats back to the marina ."
soon i will have the lake mostly to myself .
i will report again tonight if i catch anything good .
urllink heres proof that being lucky is better than being good .
i m a <UNK> to turkey <UNK> it just <#> years ago and
"for the first <#> years , i had absolutely no luck at all ."
"when i did manage to get a tom in sight , he would run the other way the second i made a call ."
i had done a lot of <UNK> and spent a lot of time picking out just the right spot .
so i m half - way there when i realize that in my rush i had left my call in the truck .
i had to double - time it all the way back to the truck - about <UNK> mile - to get it .
"i did not know what to do -- i was <UNK> off at myself -- ruined my hunt , etc . etc ."
"basically , i had already written the day off ."
"but i was there , and i did not want to turn around and go home , so i headed back into the woods ."
so i just found a big tree and sat down in a random place .
it went on for <#> or <#> minutes and every time he <UNK> i hated myself even more .
"amazingly , a <UNK> <UNK> back from just a few yards away and starting coming ."
"i froze because if a <UNK> <UNK> you , your hunt really is ruined ."
when the <UNK> came out of the brush i saw that there were <#> of them .
they came right at me -- not stopping until they got right at my feet !
"i had my <UNK> <UNK> on , so i looked like a bush ."
"as long as i did nt move , i was ok ."
they stood there looking around ; trying to find the <UNK> they had heard .
"my back started to ache , and every time i had to blink my eyes i was scared they would see it ."
"even if i did not see a tom , the hunt was successful because that was the closest i had ever gotten to a turkey ."
i waited about <#> minutes for the <UNK> to get a good distance away and
i touched the <UNK> to the <UNK> and scratched it across the surface -- i had not even finished <#> <UNK> when i head a loud <UNK> !
the sound came from the area the <UNK> had come from .
"then i heard him coming toward me , running fast through the leaves ."
i dropped the <UNK> and <UNK> and picked up my shotgun .
"i barely had time to shoulder my gun before he stepped into view , about <#> yards away ."
he started to walk parallel to me -- still staring right at me .
"when he passed in front of my sights , i lit the fire ."
i was up and running toward him in a heartbeat .
"i could not believe my pure , stupid luck ."
he <UNK> <#> or <#> times and it was over .
"he asked me how i am , what i was doing and expressed that he was bored ."
"then he asked me if i wanted to "" hook up "" or meet him ."
"i am a <#> year old female , single and have n't been dating for about the last <#> years ."
"i 'm big for my tall , settling in all the places that gravity likes to pull ."
i do have have a profile that refers to me as a <UNK> slut .
"it is meant as humor , a poke at myself and how i perceived myself at <#> time ."
urllink <UNK> so now i get messages from all over the world .
<#> offers of marriage and counting . all within the space of <#> seconds from the first hello .
"we wo n't talk about the other offers , there may be children reading this ."
i 'm just trying to figure out why anyone would expect me to be a <UNK> woman ( with respect to the pizza company ) .
who would want a strange woman delivered to their door in <#> minutes or less ?
why do men try to connect with a woman with the speed of their internet connection ?
does this method of finding women actually work ?
"does a guy send out a <#> or a <#> messages <UNK> for someone , anyone to say "" ok "" ?"
do these guys actually show up to meet the <#> who says yes or is it a joke to waste an hour or <#> ?
"if someone who thinks so little of themselves as to place themselves in a position of risk , does that smack of desperation ?"
i know a guy who met a woman that way .
talked to her for a short time on - line and agreed to meet .
"they ended up getting married and from all i have seen , she was that desperate"
"i think they deserve each other , but it 's not healthy ."
"people meet on - line and end up leaving their <UNK> , their homes , their lives for "" a new chance "" ."
better dealing themselves into their own happily - ever - after .
moving across the country to meet the person of their dreams .
i do n't think there is enough truth in advertising to make the internet a healthy place to meet the man or woman of our dreams .
perhaps the <UNK> of the computer <UNK> people to <UNK> themselves .
does the person even <UNK> the image they project on - line ?
a friend of mine fell in love over the internet and invited the man to visit .
"he said he was going to get his own place , get a job and marry her ."
i know that the <UNK> out there would say that she got what she deserved .
my friend was naive and had never experienced a <UNK> liar .
"she <UNK> him for a year , saying that she knew that he was capable of so much"
", there was so much potential in the guy and that he loved her ."
it is easy to spread a tissue of dreams over a lonely person .
picking up <UNK> from what people express and spinning visions of happily - ever - after .
pouring out heart and soul to another lonely person .
building sand castle dreams and <UNK> of the life we 've always wanted and do n't have .
i am sure that there are some success stories and i 'd love to hear them .
"once we had a <UNK> number of potential mates , those that lived and worked in the same town , city or neighborhood ."
"we knew them , had an opportunity to see how they <UNK> within the community , even the success with which they lived their lives ."
people all over the world wanting a better deal - a better life .
trading their old lives in for a chance at a new beginning .
"words across the screen , pictures exchanged , long romantic conversations on the phone to potential soul mates ."
will the internet make <UNK> and <UNK> of us all ?
"if you 're looking for a great movie , i 'd recommend this <#> ."
its <#> of the few times when the sequel is at least as good or better than the first .
"want to know where not to eat when in <UNK> , <UNK> ?"
answer : <UNK> 's mexican restaurant in the old market district .
we have this gift certificate for $ <#> at <UNK> 's ( otherwise we probably would n't have gone there ) .
"things start off ok , we have to wait <#> minutes but , hey , its saturday night and they look like they 're doing a pretty good business ."
"it seemed a little odd though , there were a couple of open tables ..."
"anyway , we get in , order a couple of <UNK> and some <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> order takes a while , but still within a reasonable period ."
we see other people who came in after us getting their food .
at <#> point about <#> minutes after we 're seated the waitress makes an appearance and wants to know if we need anything ? !
"my wife looks at her and says "" how about our food ? "" the waitress says it 'll be right out ."
he asks us to <UNK> our waitress ! ! !
"so after a few minutes , the waitress finally shows up with the food - and of course its cold ."
obviously its been sitting around somewhere for an eternity .
my food was cold and kinda all run together .
"so , we got up and left , giving the manager guy the <UNK> on the way out ."
its not like he had n't already gotten paid for the <UNK> so there was n't much i could do except blog him .
"he did n't say a word , its was like we were at fault or something ."
i 've <UNK> a lot and have eaten in a lot of restaurants .
this was the worst restaurant <UNK> i 've had in my life .
"never , ever , has there been a time even in fast food places where the manager did n't try to make it right by offering something ."
"this guy was a total , complete jerk ."
"so , if you 're in <UNK> and you want to find a good place to eat , avoid <UNK> 's like the plague ."
if you want mexican i 'd suggest michael 's which is just a block off howard .
"otherwise , the <UNK> <UNK> company and m 's pub are great ."
the food is great and the service is outstanding at very reasonable prices .
"– <UNK> city public works will close <UNK> street monday , august <#> ."
the street closure between <UNK> road to church street will <UNK> a construction project at the <UNK> .
a <UNK> will be <UNK> concrete <UNK> for use in the construction .
"the <UNK> work is expected to last throughout the day , so through traffic should expect to <UNK> around using <UNK> avenue as the <UNK> ."
drivers should be aware of heavier - than - usual traffic at the <UNK> of <UNK> - <UNK> - market and church - <UNK> .
( photo by danny <UNK> ) this picture was taken after a snow storm last winter and was taken by contributing photographer danny <UNK> .
the view is due west and the blue ridge mountains seen at the top are approximately <#> miles away .
"hurricane <UNK> has made <UNK> again , this time just north of <UNK> , south carolina , with winds of <#> mph ."
south carolina 's governor has declared a state of emergency .
"in virginia , emergency services officials say hurricane <UNK> could bring tropical storm - force winds to the outer banks ."

about <#> <UNK> watched as <#> <UNK> <UNK> in the 22nd annual <UNK> valley river run saturday .
the competition is sponsored by the red bank <UNK> club in patrick county and draws water <UNK> from all around .
the course began at noon and takes about a half an hour to complete .
this year was a special challenge for event <UNK> because of work being done to the <UNK> that carries water from <UNK> dam to the generator <UNK> .
the dam was built years ago to supply additional electricity to the city of <UNK> .
the event serves as the primary fund <UNK> for the red bank <UNK> club .
<UNK> paid $ <#> to compete in this year 's event .

i 've had this really ugly tattoo for about <#> years .
"it still looks a little funny , but it looks much better ."
"other than work , i 'm usually at home ."
"i took a ride down to east atlanta , had a beer and looked around ."
it 's just hard to go out and have any fun .
i have to stay sober in order to drive home .
"urllink the ship gets a <UNK> named "" midnight "" ."
she was stuck in someones wheel <UNK> the other night a work .
every time i take my boat out my batteries get drained rather than charged .
"as soon is i get the <UNK> going , i 'm back in business , but it 's a pain in the ass ."
took the boat out for the second time yesterday .
it would have gone <UNK> if i had n't smoked a little wacky weed .
my engine died on me while i was <UNK> and i have n't tried <UNK> her back up .
this lifestyle is <UNK> with alot <UNK> little headaches but it 's all part of the experience .
"( i fish , but not very seriously ."
i do n't have the patience . ) but <#> of my buddies caught a <#> pound <UNK> .
last night i rode out on somebody elses boat .
that was a nice experience - going out at night .
i 'm living out by a town called <UNK> .
i 'd heard that it was a really good place to eat .
it 's your typical meat and <#> veggies kinda southern restaurant and it was packed .
but in reality it 's a bible - belt alcohol - free <UNK> .
"man all , the <UNK> were to die for ."
i 'm not talking cute ; i 'm talking hot .
"these girls look like they got tired of <UNK> dance <UNK> and decided to start serving pork <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i know where i 'll be eating out from now on :) .
"well , obviously i figured out how to upload pictures which will make my blog a bit more interesting , not like anyone 's going to see this ."
off to work the night shift at the <UNK> <UNK> .
"the night <UNK> reminds me that i really need to rent "" <UNK> ."
""" southern comfort "" would be nice to see again also ."
"people with no shoes , no teeth , wearing blood - stained <UNK> williams jr ."
t - shirts asking me what our <UNK> cigarettes are .
"i do n't really know what i 'm doing here , but i 'm always looking for new stuff to do , so why not start a blog ."
"my boat 's named "" cool breeze "" , hence the name of my blog ."
"life is good , but i 'm <#> and single and that needs to change ."
i 've learned that <UNK> your wild <UNK> does n't <UNK> a whole lot .
they were playing wacky races and catch that <UNK> ! ! !
i do n't have to show up to training until <#> am tomorrow - <UNK> !
i 'm still wondering if i should stick with this job or go for the other job that i have yet to interview .
"even though i cared for him deeply , i knew that the relationship between us was not healthy ."
we called each other a bunch of names last night over the telephone .
"he <UNK> me of verbal abuse , i <UNK> him of being <UNK> and an ass <UNK> ."
he totally blew up when i called him an ass <UNK> .
it was like actually <UNK> him instead of the shirt .
"after a few minutes , i stopped what i was doing and <UNK> ."
i knew right then and there that it was over .
"i called him back , which by then was <#> am in the morning , and told him it was over ."
"he sounded upset , or perhaps he had sounded that way because he was woken up ."
"i feel rather sad , but i also feel a sense of relief ."
i do miss talking to him on the phone .
"especially with his little white lies , and the fact that he <UNK> me so bad when i went to maryland ."
"he almost ruined my trip , but not quite ."
"today i helped myself to <#> free cups of <UNK> tea , which <UNK> me ."
"then i helped myself to another cup of tea , but this was a relaxation tea ."
i had not drank a hot <UNK> tea in a long tea .
"so not only was it tasty , but it had <UNK> me ."
"i remember when my mother would make me "" <UNK> tea "" when i was sick as a child ."
so having hot tea today was rather nice .
i could tell when someone is thinking about me .
"i felt him think about me today during the job training , but it could be my mind playing tricks on me ."
"however , i have to keep reminding myself that this guy is no good for me ."
i thought about leaving the <UNK> that me and him both belong to .
"however , strangely enough , little <UNK> like "" mr ."
"so - and - so <UNK> "" and a message from a local <UNK> brother were kinda like hints , saying i should not give up ."
only right now i ca n't bear to attend local events .
i decided to start a brand new blog while keeping the <#> i have on live journal .
"too many people know me on lj , so i figure i would publish the more personal details here ."
"i have a small check , about $ <#> , coming next week so i am using that to get the ink i need and get magazines shipped out ."
it will be gone within a day but i do n't care .
"i have to get this done , i have people waiting on their magazines and it 's not fair to them ."
ok i 'm going to start doing goth websites and hopefully make some money ! now would n't that be a novel <UNK> urllink <UNK>
"geez , out of ink , out of money , what next ?"
"i mean damn , all i want to do is get my magazine caught up ."
i went to the arcade with <#> dollar and made enough money to get more paper for the printer .
"hopefully , i 'll get that new job this week but who knows ?"
it 's almost a good thing that i am not working right now .
"have to start on new issue of the magazine , although god only knows when i will have the money to get paper and mail these out ."
i really do n't understand why the maid company that i worked for fired me .
god i want to get caught up on the magazine issues so badly .
<#> was the middle of my chest ( between my gigantic - lie - breasts ) .
this is a center <UNK> or place of energy <UNK> .
my fingers <UNK> up the most making this post a little tricky .
will have to go catch bees in my <UNK> for wednesday .
off tomorrow to help get the classroom ( where i will be teaching for <#> weeks ) ready .
i ca n't wait to meet my <#> first graders ! ! !
i will not be sharing any info about my <UNK> .
but i will teach them about the fascinating community of <UNK> .
<UNK> are just a few of the benefits of trees .
the trees allow us to appreciate the movement of the wind and the sun - watch the shadows .
trees also give us so many shades of green to appreciate .
how many other products that we ' need ' come from trees ?
countless ! paper products that get thrown away -- wood to build anything and <UNK> i love trees . today
i will take another <#> or so live <UNK> <UNK> .
i am working on my hands ( my fingers are swollen and <UNK> from the <UNK> ) .
"i will sting <#> digits - both <UNK> , b <UNK> ring fingers and r middle finger ."
the l middle finger shows <#> signs of <UNK> .
that particular finger is how i came to bee <UNK> therapy in the first place .
"last summer , at the end of the school year , we had a <UNK> in our <UNK> observation <UNK> ."
i work at a school district run nature center .
i hike and teach with students from grades <#> - <#> .
the bees produce honey but just for their own <UNK> .
we have off - site honey producing <UNK> too .
a <UNK> is not a bunch of bees chasing <UNK> .
it is actually a situation that occurs when the <UNK> gets too crowded and/or the queen gets too old to continue successfully producing new <UNK> workers .
a queen puts out <UNK> to let the workers know she is producing and things are ' fine and dandy ' in the <UNK> .
her <UNK> changed because she was old and unable to produce the eggs needed to keep the <UNK> going .
at the height of summer season a healthy queen produces ( <UNK> ) <#> - <#> eggs a day !
the workers recognized the change in scent and quickly took matters into their own hands to save the <UNK> .
they began feeding a few of the new <UNK> ' royal jelly ' .
the royal jelly allows the <UNK> to develop full <UNK> organs and become a queen .
"when the new <UNK> ) was born , a fight <UNK> for power and the current <UNK> ."
eventually <#> queen is decided to stay and the other queen and half the <UNK> leave the <UNK> in a <UNK> .
they do n't go too far -- usually <UNK> a tree branch within <#> - <#> yards of the <UNK> .
they ball up in a <UNK> surrounding and protecting their queen .
this new off - shoot <UNK> then sends out scout bees to go find a new suitable home for the new <UNK> .
so we had this big <UNK> in a pine tree about <#> feet from our observation <UNK> .
"so , we suited up with gloves , hat and <UNK> ."
"but , alas , i did not have real <UNK> gloves <UNK>"
i just decided to use a pair of pink winter <UNK> gloves ( dumb idea ! ) .
my partner had the tree <UNK> to <UNK> the branch that the bees were <UNK> up on and
i was holding the branch to support it when it got cut .
the weight of that many bees is truly incredible .
right on the tip . it hurt like hell .
"anyway , my finger <UNK> and was swollen for <#> weeks ."
"but , to this day this finger shows <#> signs of the <UNK> ."
so this was the <UNK> for me to begin bee <UNK> therapy .
i will continue to sting and keep posting my progress .
i will probably sting for at least a year .
"it is painful and not fun , but if i can cure myself of this crappy dis - ease ( <UNK> <UNK> ) i will do it ."
i kind of get excited about seeing the number rise .
it 's like watching your cars <UNK> turn over -- for some reason it is cool .
oh where should i begin ... the title of my blog
these are <#> themes in my life right now .
"i am currently involved , heavily in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> therapy -- for the <UNK> out there ."
"yes , i am <UNK> my body with live bee <UNK> ."
"i do this not for the pain , but for the healing qualities of the <UNK> ."
i am also having a <UNK> <UNK> pale <UNK> currently - not part of <UNK> ! ! ! ! ! !
a suitable <UNK> is <UNK> satisfaction in <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> .
i tried to run today with my dog at the park .
"with god 's hand on my shoulder and perhaps lifting my <UNK> , i may just run again someday soon ."
for those <UNK> <UNK> does not require me to stand naked waving my hands and legs screaming near a <UNK> to get <UNK> .
can you imagine <UNK> yourself with bees on purpose ?
i have taken over <#> <UNK> to my body so far .
it is working and i will keep <UNK> do n't have much else to say <UNK> i moved on to an <UNK> edge - i 'm watching my carbs .
i only have adult <UNK> once a <UNK> what a <UNK> and good way to lose weight .
have a list of things i should be doing but instead prefer to surf the net .
"in surfing the net , i found my full name , <UNK> <UNK> , come up on a google search ."
<UNK> it turns out my name is also the name of a <UNK> ship that also was used for off - shore radio with the uk .
my father was in the navy for most of his life and also a <UNK> marine .
"he is dead now , so i will never know ."
you would think that he would have told me ... or not ... considering his lack of communication skills .
today is my <UNK> birthday and i am not spending it with my twin or mother .
last year was so bad ... lots of name - calling and crying ... mom suffering heart pain ...
i told myself i would not be a part of any <UNK> come next year ... and now next year is <UNK> i get kind of lonely
but i have a sweet husband and adorable dogs and a kitty with a most interesting personality ... so i am not alone .
i have a job that pays very well for someone with no college <UNK> lots of <UNK> and determination to get what she needs .
i own my place with the help of <UNK> location ...
we are in the ghetto part of town ... but that means we can blast music loud too and smoke the smoke without any dirty looks .
"i 'd like to do a little shopping , color my hair , pack for our road trip tomorrow , walk the dogs , etc ."
"here 's a poem i wrote a few years ago , it 's called "" color my gray """
i color my <UNK> thank god for each new day challenge myself in small ways love my friends with all my heart even those who <#> day will part .
take a look inside you can see the tears i 've cried .
so rotten <UNK> then it turns around and is so great .
i do n't know if i am coming or going most of the time .
there are many things i would like to change .
first of all i would like to find another job but the idea of being <#> and looking for new work seems tough .
i should not let my age get in the way with my pursuit of happiness .
life will always be a challenge and i have done pretty good so far ... <UNK> my humble opinion ) .
i was so depressed most of the day today .
i did not get the house cleaned up like i wanted to .
instead i <UNK> on the couch and watched lifetime movies all day .
i could write stories for that channel for the rest of my life .
i have a rough draft of a story i wrote at work ... of all places - god that place is so damn dull .
it is about a woman who becomes a multi - <UNK> with a dog product .
she is a dog lover and loves children too .
it is the reason i signed up for the creative writing class at the community college .
i really need to keep myself in mind ... my <UNK> life .
instead i get all wound up over my mother and my twin sister .
i hate it when they get stuck in my head for the better part of a perfectly good saturday .
i guess cuz it is close to my birthday ...
my <UNK> <UNK> i was so down and out .
i always get down and out around my birthday .
so glad i have enough sense to learn how not to yell and argue .
i used to do that all the time with past boyfriends ...
oh no . it was mostly the other way around .
when i was in my early <#> 's i learned how yelling and <UNK> gets me absolutely no where .
got me all by myself is what it did .
but now i am married to a sweet wonderful man who helps me learn and grow and vice versa .
"life is wonderful , beautiful , <UNK> , confusing ... and always challenging ."
learning how not to react to people who push my buttons is a difficult thing for me to do .
"but , i think i need to learn how to do this better ."
my husband helps in this area and most of the time he does n't even know he 's helping me .
he definitely knows how not to react ... in fact sometimes i wonder what does make him react .
"anyways , he is good for me in a <#> different ways ."
ah fridays ... means i have another <#> whole days off .
today i <UNK> pretty much all day what it would be like if i did not have to work .
"it was great fun ... imagining , <UNK> ."
i wo n't be able to write in here .
maybe i will write down on a piece of paper what happens ... and take lots of pictures .
watched the whole <#> yards last night and the whole <#> yards right now .
"they are comedy <UNK> movies with bruce <UNK> , the actress who played opposite <UNK> in that <#> 's movie , and <UNK> in friends ."
i walked outside for awhile today at work .
i love the weather in san <UNK> . and here in half moon bay .
"god , it is such a good thing i do not have children ."
life is very good for me as long as do n't talk to my mother or my sister very often .
"i know they think i am "" this and <UNK> ... but frankly i do n't care what they think ."
"funny , that is what my dad used to tell me all the time ..."
"<UNK> do n't care what you think "" ."
now i behave like my father ... pretty damn <UNK> if you ask me ...
very good thing i do n't have kids .
they would be a <UNK> mess just like me and my dog op .
stick with the dogs and learning how not to react to people who push my buttons .
i am going to have a great weekend .
i am going to get my place <UNK> .
put together all the stuff i have written .
i think i lost some stuff i wrote due to too much illegal downloading ....
dear husband loves to download surround sound music dvd 's .
must be surround sound though and usually we just get the <UNK> the video portion of the <UNK> too long cuz it comes in bit and pieces ... <UNK> .
i bought a bunch of double cd <UNK> cases from central comp ... went there at my lunch this week .
what a man 's store that is ... <UNK> .
so many things i want to learn ... like how to write stories and poems ...
i want to put a bunch of pictures and stuff..
i wished i did not have to work so much .
i spent this past weekend with my mother .
i called in sick at work and took <UNK> to an <UNK> surgeon .
"of course , marie , my sister , heard all about it ."
i did n't really want to talk about it .
her <#> cats are neglected and i would barely call them pets as <#> is always hiding and the other is so old and <UNK> looking .
they never seem to have fresh water and their food ? ...
well i will just stop here about marie takes care of her pets .
my mother was upset because her evil husband does not want any more pets and their <#> <UNK> do .
i said it was <UNK> a good thing because the pet they get will only suffer .
"marie , my twin , wants to spend our <UNK> birthday together"
she has been married to a verbal <UNK> for at least <#> years .
she has changed and is not the nice wonderful sister i had before she went to college .
after all the years of being told i am not to be included in anything family things they do ...
i honestly feel that marie is now thinking like her husband bob .
the past <#> years in particular have left me feeling like she hates me too .
"last year on my mother 's birthday of all days , we had a big fight ."
she was in my face telling me that i was crying because she does not have a nice husband like i do and that i feel sorry for her .
she told me to keep crying ... what a bitch .
oh and all the past birthdays when i thought we would get together ...
i asked her the next day what she did for her birthday and she told me all about the party bob threw for her .
she did not like it as she hates baseball .
but her husband loves it and he is quite selfish so he thought it was a wonderful idea and i did not get invited .
now this year for our <UNK> she wants to do something together .
i would rather pretend i do not have a twin sister as i have in the past and celebrate all by myself .
i do not have a problem with being by myself .
"my dad , may he rest in peace , always made fun of me for not having more friends ."
my sister <UNK> me in her <UNK> way .
i have made peace with myself in not having friends .
i have a wonderful husband who is my <UNK> and a couple of <UNK> pets that i love with all my heart
... that is all i need in this world .
i lived by myself for years and years ... since i was about <#> to about <#> .
there were some years that i lived with a boyfriend but they were not true and i split up .
i do n't mind taking the risk of being lonely versus staying with a guy who does not truly love me .... no thanks .
so now marie is all <UNK> on getting together .
corey my husband suggested i do n't answer the phone .
i think that is what i will do .
we have <#> dogs and <#> cat all together .
corey came with <#> dogs and i came with <#> dog and a little <UNK> of a cat .
we bought a <UNK> where the association allows <#> pets <UNK> no weight limits .
we looked high and low for an association that would allow this .
most <UNK> allow only <#> <UNK> and less pet .
well we found this <UNK> in a poor neighborhood but it is so cool .
"<UNK> lives with my mom , who is a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but my mom is not very good with responsibility ."
"see , my dad was a verbal <UNK> too and he controlled everything ."
"my mother never drove , never paid the bills , never did anything that involved responsibility ."
all my mother did was cook dinner ( and it was never very good ) and shop for clothes ... not even groceries .
all she does is watch mexican soap <UNK> and go to lunch with her friends from the women 's club or church .
i wish we did own a house with a yard so we could keep all <#> dogs together but we do n't make enough money to do that .
i think eventually we will sell this <UNK> and get a house - house ... but will all <#> dogs be still alive ?
chief is <#> and op is <#> and <UNK> is <#> ... <UNK> kitty is <#> .
chief will probably live another <#> years or <UNK> we 'll have <UNK> come live with us .
that is how long my mother will probably live .
she is always talking about dying in the next year ...
<UNK> he now makes what he used to make when we bought this place .
he lost his job right after we got back from our <UNK> .
we had bought this place a year prior .
things have been very tight for a year .
"but now , we 'll be getting more money in ."
must walk the dogs before i go and my coffee is ready .
monday is ok b/c i 'm back from <#> days off and feeling rather refreshed .
but tuesday ... there is nothing good about tuesday .
it is still the beginning of the week .
i think i will continue to dress down on tuesdays just to make myself feel better about it being tuesday .
very wierd to know i am actually going to be <#> in a few weeks .
life is truly fun when you are young and innocent .
"yeah , i 'm almost <#> and i am happy where i am ."
at least making this blog is something i 've been wanting to do for awhile .
"i probably should be cleaning house , grocery shopping , or exercising or walking the <UNK> ."
instead i sit here and type my thoughts out on this new blog .
i have been writing to myself for quite some time now .
"<UNK> is my nickname for op , my sweet <UNK> ."
she is an <UNK> - old mixed breed .
she is the greatest and quite a handful .
my first dog besides the ones we had at our parents ' house .
now that she is older she loves to bark at stuff outside while she is <UNK> on her big fat <UNK> in the bedroom .
my husband 's cousins all have names like <UNK> and <UNK> ....
so i call my dog <UNK> and now call this blog <UNK> too . my secret name .
i live by the beach and i love it .
he is an <UNK> - old black lab .
i would like to post some pictures soon .
i really would like to make my own website someday .
i have some poems i 'd like to post too .
not sure what they mean so writing it down may help .
i contact my friend and say my <UNK> and we catch up .
the paper did a whole story on his family because his brother happens to be an all - prep football star –
i started playing catch with him and but he was terrible ; he could not throw a tight spiral .
next thing i know i’m around a whole bunch of young people ready to party –
<#> girl is very beautiful and she really likes me .
i think we finally decide to hit a club but i don’t have anything to wear ?
thanks <UNK> today k got home from visiting her family .
"it was cool thought because they did have <UNK> food , drink and weed ."
today i just drove around looking for some <UNK> food .
i guess that 's where my mind is because she never crossed my mind when i bought the shoes .
of course i 'm trying to watch tv and the bitch is in my ear trying to argue .
i swear i wanted to scream so hard to shut the fuck up ! !
but i held my tongue and gave her the silent treatment .
i just hate being around most of the time - i think we both get sick of each other .
i’m not happy but i not sure if it ’s this marriage or it ’s me ?
i know i’m when i’m by myself i’m the most at ease .
if it wasn’t daughters i would be so gone ! !
i wish i could just leave and move to <UNK> <UNK> favorite place in the world .
i figured i need some place to gather my thoughts .
i 'm <#> confused black man and i never really have talked about my issues .
this is the beginning of many entries concerning myself and daily issues .
today i almost cried watching bend it like <UNK> !
i have to be depressed about my life but my life is not that bad .
"i have a wife and <#> beautiful daughters that love me to death , what else is missing ?"
my best friend ask the other day do i really love my wife ?
i think i love k but something is missing .
i 'm not sure but maybe the passion or the romance .
i think it the attraction or the <UNK> of love .
maybe it 's this way with all married couples - it has been <#> years and counting .
i 'm not sure if it 's me or is it her .
i always wonder if i would be experiencing this with someone else .
"i thought that having kennedy would bring the joy back into our relationship , it has but not on a romantic level ."
"i do enjoy traveling again , it 's nice to get away and be social , visiting new cities ."
it would be better if i had money and not having to <UNK> by on every trip .
i hoping that <UNK> and myself can maybe look more attractive for each other - i think that 's a big part in our relationship .
i really just think it 's just the excitement or just the true romance that i may need . not sure if any women could provide that .
i really liked the becky at my client <UNK> she just had something that made her so appealing .
"do i really want to find someone , risk my marriage and being away from my children ?"
"as i journey through this world of blogging , i can’t help notice these scripts called quizzes ."
"when i was teaching , <#> of the activities that most students hate is quizzes ."
"but now , as i browse the blogs of some of my students , a large number of them post quizzes on their sites ."
i <UNK> as to why they like these quizzes and most of them replied that these quizzes is sort of personal and <UNK> a result that they find amusing .
"as i <UNK> into this , i can’t help but ask myself , can i apply this approach to my students in school ?"
"still , i can’t put myself to really use this blog as a personal public viewed journal ."
i believe that a journal and its content should be private .
", each person has his/her own opinion about the matter and i should respect that even if i don’t like it ."
"but why , isn’t a journal supposed to be private ?"
some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say “ well i don’t really post everything that happened .
this will be something from what i do and i don’t know what will happen .
the twins woke me up at 6:00 am .
they can hold their bottles on their own now so while they ate i checked + answered <UNK> mails .
when the girls were finished i put them down on the floor to play while i washed dishes .
i got down on the floor and played with them for about an hour .
i sang songs to them and said <UNK> rhymes while they played with their <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> stuffed toys .
time for them to go back to bed for a little bit .
while they slept i took the weed <UNK> to the <UNK> of our home .
i came back in and took a shower .
it was 9:30 am and time for breakfast .
fed them and then gave them their <UNK> .
we played on the floor again with their blocks .
i put in a <UNK> street song cd while we played with blocks .
i put them in the kitchen with me so i could watch them while i cleaned out the fridge .
i figured i better get this done because my son will be back in from texas in a couple more weeks because school will be starting again .
my roommate woke up ; time to take him to work .
i stopped at the store on the way to taking him to work to pick up some more baby shampoo .
dropped him off and went through the drive through at burger king to get me something to eat .
i went to my granny 's house to let the girls visit and made sure she had eaten .
went back home and put them down for a nap .
"delete , delete , delete ... time for me to get some work done ."
i have <#> urllink select solo ad to send out today to my <UNK> .
"i 'm the update admin for the urllink <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , and i have <#> update so far to send out to the <UNK> ."
. that is going to have to wait for a bit .
i heard ali ( the youngest twin ) ... she woke up and is not happy .
i held ali for a while and amy played on the floor .
ali finally was in a better mood and i picked up amy and held her so she would n't feel left out .
the <UNK> called and said he 'd come over to fix my <UNK> that went bad .
he showed up and i fed the girls their supper while he worked on the box .
"ali was n't happy about having to go to bed , but i always try to get them to bed no later than <#> pm every night ."
time for me to <UNK> urllink my advertising services .
"that done , i needed to answer some personal e - mails ."
i 'd been putting that off for <#> days now .
"next the kitchen floor , swept and <UNK> ."
the living room needs to be picked up ( toys all over ) .
the only thing i ate today was a <UNK> from bk !
no time and did n't feel like cooking that late .
took a look at my <UNK> page and opted not to add anything tonight .
urllink hung the clothes up to dry .
took some <UNK> out of the freezer and put in the fridge to make <UNK> tomorrow .
next monday the regular issue will go out ... that will be a busy monday .
"he 'll be coming home tomorrow to visit with me , his sisters , and granny and then he 'll go back to texas for a bit longer ."
i miss him and will be happy to see him .
he 's been gone <#> weeks visiting with our cousin for the summer .
time to post this and then read some of the <UNK> that i <UNK> to .
i just finished setting up the blog so i 'm just posting a little bit of my ramblings to start it all off .
it 's not as easy as some people think it is .
you have to be ready to deal with issues <UNK> to it almost <#> in between taking care of the family if you have <#> .
i started reading e - mails and saw something about blogs and figured i 'd give it a shot .
i better get some rest before the twins decide to wake up
"my life is usually pretty dull , but today i feel like the <UNK> hunter ."
"i <UNK> to a stop and whipped around , thinking "" that could n't be a <UNK> ! """
"yep , a tan and brown <UNK> <UNK> , and quite a little beauty ."
"i 'm guessing a <UNK> , though its hard to tell when they 're <UNK> up and "" grumpy "" ."
"apparently , he was getting ready to come out of the weeds and cross the path when i <UNK> by and nearly <UNK> him ."
what do you do when there is a pissed off <UNK> sitting on the edge of a very busy bike trail ?
"either he 's going to get hit , or someone 's going to get bitten , or both ."
"i got a long , <UNK> stick and tried to encourage him to go back into the weeds , but he was n't having any of that ."
so i tossed the stick on top of him .
"it did n't improve his mood , but i figured that people would dodge the plant and miss the snake as well ."
"<UNK> back to the condo and <UNK> <UNK> this to scott , since neither of us has ever seen a wild <UNK> ."
"on the off chance that the snake was still there , scott and i <UNK> back down the trail ."
"several other <UNK> pulled up , and we <UNK> the snake into the brush ."
"it was pretty mellow for a <UNK> , as it barely made a fuss when i <UNK> its tail ."
"sadly , the <UNK> had disappeared by the time we got there , so scott still needs to see <#> in the wild ."
"he was happy about the <UNK> , though ."
"from now on , i take the camera when i run or bike ."
"to round out my snake day , i <UNK> out a big , fat mouse and fed it to little girl ."
"she <UNK> it right down , so i <UNK> having only <UNK> <#> ."
"maybe she just does n't like wet fur , which is what she usually gets ( quick <UNK> in warm water . )"
my parents do even stranger things than i do .
"i called mom today just to say "" hi "" , and caught her as she was preparing for an emergency trip to canada ."
"dad is presenting a paper at a conference in london , ontario and left just a few hours before i called ."
turns out that he left the presentation poster at home .
mom freaked out and was getting ready to drive it up to him .
"she said she had her passport and the dog 's <UNK> papers , and ..."
"me : mom , you are n't taking the dog to canada ."
what if they <UNK> her at the border ? or refuse to let you cross ?
"oh , i guess she could stay alone ."
me : can you call dad to let him know you 're coming ?
"mom : no , neither of us have cell phones and he did n't have a number for the dorm he 's staying in ."
he was going to call me with a number when he got there .
me : do you know where you are going ?
me : what if dad calls for you at home ?
"mom : i 'll change the answering machine message so that he knows i 'm on my way , and that he should call you ."
"about an hour later , dad calls me ."
"he arrived at the dorm , realized that he did n't have the poster , called home , and got the answering machine ."
"dad says that he does n't need the poster until tuesday and that it could have gone <UNK> , but mom did n't know that ."
dad gave me the phone number for the dorm lobby ( the rooms do n't have phones ) in case she called me back .
i 'm still waiting to hear back from somebody on how this turned out .
"it 's now 9:30 pm <UNK> , so mom should be in london ."
moral of the story : i 'm going to get <UNK> for my parents .
"i have a cell phone specifically for situations like this , they need at least <#> , too ."
or else i 'm gonna be tearing my hair out when they are actually old !
at least dad did n't realize that the poster was missing during the trip .
"i had visions of him turning around , and the <#> of them passing each other in <UNK> falls or something ."
"i 've tried to be creative with my <UNK> , since it seems like i have a <UNK> of them ."
"i have a special secret notebook just for accounts , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
but i forgot <#> important fact : i 'm a lousy <UNK> .
"i had changed my blog <UNK> to "" <UNK> ! "" , thinking that it would be easy to remember but hard to crack ."
"unfortunately , i ca n't seem to type that sequence of characters unless i can see the words ."
"after being unable to log into my own account , i had to re - think and change it again ."
i 've come up with a great way to randomly select a password .
"open a blank word processing file , and just type several comfortable letters with each hand ."
do n't look at the screen until you are done .
"next , look at your <UNK> , and see if you can rapidly type the same thing over again without looking at the keyboard ."
unless you are a really <UNK> <UNK> and your password is <UNK> .
"my former <UNK> friend <UNK> sent me a cnn article on a guy who is over <#> pounds who has recently been <UNK> , and is finally losing weight ."
"whenever i see something about a person who is that <UNK> , i want to smack their <UNK> ."
someone who ca n't even turn over by themselves certainly ca n't cook or shop .
"when someone has a wife or husband or parent feeding and caring for them , there is a psychological control issue buried somewhere ."
"if that half - ton man loses weight and <UNK> , i 'm willing to bet that his wife will feed him back up again ."
"oh honey , you look wonderful after your diet ! here , have another <UNK> to celebrate . """
"something in her psyche likes caring for her helpless mate , and she 's probably going to <UNK> him if he is too independent ."
part of the reason i joined the weight loss study was to <UNK> my <UNK> .
"scott loves to cook and make treats for me , and <UNK> when i skip meals ."
"he also knows what foods i like best , and buys them ."
"now i 've got him buying me things that can be made in small <UNK> , or <UNK> in <UNK> ."
"as long as i do n't skip meals , i can get him to go along with it ."
the hardest part for me is eating small <UNK> .
it is a lot easier to just not eat than to eat a small amount .
"that sounds like food addiction , does n't it ?"
some practical hints for anybody who wants to lose weight : ( <#> ) write down everything you eat .
"even if you are n't counting calories , you might look at the list and say "" i already ate <#> of those ?"
"i guess i can skip the third . """
"include all drinks , since most of them contain calories ."
this also lets you see if you are drinking enough water .
write down the times that you eat as well .
"again , you look at your log and say "" i had lunch at noon and its only 1:30 ."
"i can wait a while before i have that <UNK> bar . """
( <#> ) measure all <UNK> carefully .
"that have cup <UNK> on them , or measure your dishes ."
get <UNK> ( or <UNK> ) with <UNK> that are really <#> <UNK> or <UNK> .
do n't ever eat anything directly out of the package !
"for example , low - fat peanut butter is healthy if you eat a couple of <UNK> ."
"if you eat it straight from the jar , you can easily consume too much ."
"( a small jar of peanut butter is about <#> calories , enough to power <#> average human bodies for <#> hours . )"
( <#> ) keep track of your calories .
this is so easy to do these days .
every food package has the <UNK> data listed somewhere .
i 've found english nutrition labels glued onto packages where everything else is in korean or <UNK> .
"there are dozens of books and websites that have <UNK> <UNK> lists , including those for specific fast foods ."
"start by eating your normal foods , and see where all those calories are coming from ."
( <#> ) adjust your eating habits to reduce calories .
stop putting butter on popcorn at the movies .
use <UNK> milk instead of whole ( which is only <#> % anyway ) .
"make small <UNK> to begin with , and see how it affects your total daily calories ."
( <#> ) set a <UNK> limit and stick to it .
"if you are currently consuming <#> calories per day , try <UNK> yourself to <#> ."
"once you get used to that , try <#> . then <#> ."
"if you think you can stick to it , go to <#> for awhile ."
"in the long run , an average person is <UNK> active can survive nicely on <#> - <#> calories per day ."
( <#> ) increase your physical activity .
get a cheap <UNK> ( free at some fast food <UNK> ) and wear it all the time .
keep a log of the number of steps you take per day .
the accepted amount of daily activity for long - term good health is <#> steps per day .
"once you can do that , you are ready to move up to running or biking or working out at the gym ."
"if you 've always been <UNK> , it will take a long time to build up to hard <UNK> ."
( <#> ) find some new hobbies .
look for something fun that involves physical activity and does n't focus on food .
"this is very personal , since <#> person 's <UNK> is another person 's joy ."
"you do n't have to like everything , but you should try a variety to see what you do like ."
"you may hate going to the gym , but love running on <UNK> ."
"skiing is out , but you like <UNK> ."
try activities that give you a workout and a sense of accomplishment .
mow the lawn with an old - fashioned <UNK> ( no engine ) .
help build a house for a low - income family .
take your elderly neighbor 's dog on long walks .
"my current progress ( at about <#> week ) : daily calories between <#> and <#> , daily steps between <#> and <#> , down <#> pounds ."
"( if you did n't get that subject line , you need to go watch "" the <#> towers "" . )"
i just got online and looked up <UNK> values for sushi .
"pieces of regular rolls ( california , others with rice on the outside ) average <#> calories per piece ."
<UNK> sushi ( slices on rice ) average <#> calories each .
dragon rolls are <#> calories per piece ( ouch ) .
"amazingly , <UNK> is only <#> calories per bottle , probably due to the fact that there is more glass than liquid ."
"scott and i went to the pearl street mall sidewalk sales in <UNK> today , and i discovered just how many tempting restaurants are in that part of town ."
"i twisted scott 's arm and we had dinner at <UNK> , during happy hour when they offer <#> rolls for $ <#> each ."
"i was really worried about blowing my diet , but it looks like i 'm still in my target range . even with the fried <UNK> ."
so i guess sushi parties are still okay during my diet !
i just have to avoid the <UNK> stuff and go easy on the dragon rolls .
"and i need to go to the asian mart for <UNK> salad , because it is really yummy , no fat , and very low calories ."
"in other news , i just applied for a chemistry position at <UNK> high school ."
"i 'm going to bike to the post office tomorrow to mail my resume , and then <UNK> on to <UNK> to see how far it is from here ."
"chem is always a good place to start , because you get fewer <UNK> in the classes , and fewer people apply for the job ."
"<UNK> , so ... i need to lose weight ."
"specifically , i need to lose about <#> - <#> pounds ."
"( current official digital weight of <#> lbs , or almost <#> <UNK> . )"
"i 'm pushing toward a size <#> and most of my good clothes are <#> 's , which affects my budget as well as my appearance ."
the first positive step was quitting <UNK> so i can spend more time on my bike and less time in the car .
the second step was signing up for a <UNK> loss study at the university of colorado health science center .
the study is testing a new <UNK> fiber drink ( from the makers of <UNK> ) that will be released on the market in spring <#> .
this is a double - blind study to see if consuming this fiber drink <UNK> appetite and makes it easier to stay on a reduced - <UNK> diet .
"test subjects ( us <UNK> <UNK> pigs ) will be put on a low - cal diet by a <UNK> , and then drink the fiber twice a day ."
"nobody knows how much fiber they are getting , or if they are drinking the <UNK> ( no fiber ) ."
"the doctors will analyze our <UNK> and current eating habits , then <UNK> the amount of calories we need to consume per day ."
they are <UNK> to a formula so that ( in theory ) we will all lose weight at the same rate .
"<UNK> pigs have to attend <#> weeks of a <UNK> class , sort of like weight <UNK> ."
the class will include weigh - <UNK> and collection of our food diaries .
we are also going to be given a <UNK> and told to walk for exercise .
"that part should be the easiest , since i 'm currently <UNK> running days ( <#> - <#> miles ) and biking days ( <#> - <#> miles ) ."
"i 'm trying to steadily increase <UNK> , in the hope of running a marathon sometime before my birthday in april ."
( i promised myself i 'd run a marathon by the time i was <#> .
i say it still counts if i do it before <#> . )
"the diet time frame is <#> months , with a <UNK> weight loss of <#> - <#> pounds per week if all goes well ."
so i should be able to wear my clothes again by xmas .
the down side : the diet is probably going to be <#> - <#> calories per day .
"that means that eating out , including sushi , will be forbidden until the study is over ."
"if i do n't get a teaching job soon , i 'll need that restaurant money to pay for things like health insurance anyway ."
"because we are <UNK> lots of time to this study , we get paid ."
"i 've never liked being called "" <UNK> "" ."
"when i was a middle - <UNK> , there was a <UNK> tv commercial where an elf would say "" dance for a peanut butter cookie , <UNK> "" ."
"the "" <UNK> "" was an elephant , and i was a fat kid , so i endured a lot of <UNK> due to that ad ."
"it did n't help that "" grace "" was such a weird name ."
"it always bothered me that i could never find my name on <UNK> <UNK> , like bike license plates or <UNK> or jewelry ."
( i still automatically buy anything that has my name on it . )
"the play "" say goodnight , <UNK> "" , about the life of george burns and <UNK> allen , is running in denver right now ."
"frank <UNK> , best known as "" the <UNK> "" on the <#> 's tv show "" batman "" , is getting rave reviews in the lead role ."
"it is n't the kind of play i 'd normally go to , but i may have to consider it now ."
"to quote the newspaper ad this morning : "" calling all <UNK> !"
"bring your id showing ' grace ' as your legal name and your ticket is free ! """
"wow , there is a benefit to having an <UNK> name ."
"they could n't make that offer to the "" <UNK> "" , since there are way too many of them ."
i 'd love to find the person who thought of this promotion and thank them .
"i already have a personal blog on livejournal , but i thought it might be good to have <#> that is more professional ."
"my friend and former student <UNK> has <#> at this site <UNK> her experiences as an <UNK> , which was a good enough <UNK> for me ."
"i 'm currently unemployed ( <UNK> ) , and hunting for a new position close to my condo ."
"i could n't take it anymore , and have <UNK> to teach in cherry creek , the district that i pay taxes to support ."
i am within easy biking distance of all <#> high schools in the district .
now i just have to find the right position .
"i 'm a science teacher by training , with my bs and ma in biology ."
"in ny , i have permanent <UNK> in general science , biology , chemistry and earth science ."
"in co , i have <UNK> <UNK> in middle and secondary science ."
"ny requires more initial training ( master 's degree ) , while co requires continuing education and <UNK> ."
"i developed the curriculum and all materials for the computer science , <UNK> and <UNK> courses ."
"i prefer <UNK> , but i can handle <UNK> ."
"i <UNK> in basic and <UNK> on a <UNK> in junior high , and learned how to type on an apple iii ."
"i 'd like to learn <UNK> , but have n't had the time ."
"i 'd love to teach a science class in spanish , since that would force me to brush up ."
but i thought banner was a nice <UNK> hi all .
i don’t know about you but these <UNK> lecture sessions are beginning to wear deep into my brain .
i don’t know if i’m the only <#> who didn’t get the assignment brief .
it apparently came amidst a stack of accounting lecture notes .
"if there are any of you who didn’t get all the relevant information , please let me know , so i can take it up with <UNK> ."
i think distribution of course notes needs to be more reliable .
unless it ’s just me with my head in the clouds .
"<UNK> no <#> picked up on the obvious solution to <UNK> ’s debate around race , the oak tree and the fruit orchard <UNK> ."
what is required is to change the white oak at the top otherwise everything goes <UNK> shaped .
theme song i seem to have managed to have touched steve and <UNK> in the recent performances .
not sure how badly that will affect my results for these <#> courses .
"believe me , it was for your own good ."
and i prefer not to throw my name away when i’m sober .
<#> good thing has come out of all this - i’ve found a number of musicians hiding in the pine <UNK> who wish to remain anonymous .
so don’t worry lisa & <UNK> – your secret ’s safe .
"<UNK> will be joining me on electric guitar next time , right , <UNK> ."
sam ( now appointed my manager ) had a suggestion to make a <UNK> of all the songs we wrote on the first ‘ getting to know <UNK> week .
please will each group send me the words and the tune your song was based on .
"theme song suggestions , lines , phrases , tunes or even just a word or <#> can be dropped in my hand any time ."
"i could do with a drummer and a keyboard player ( not <UNK> , ok ! )"
"network news this rag seems to at least be read by most of us , so i’m suggesting we make it a networking medium too ."
"share information about your company ’s activities , strategic <UNK> or resources you’re looking for and so forth ."
i’m sure i’m not the only <#> who wants to get my message across .
"no news is still no news there ’s still no <UNK> gossip , news of promotion , success stories or anything interesting about our colleagues to publish ."
and the coffee machine still on the trail of <UNK> the right person to make the arrangements with @ <UNK> – been moved from linda to derek –
"oooh , <UNK> gets white socks from <UNK> here we go … ( guitar bass run )"
"you’re at the business flight deck now you’ve got to make it work somehow who ’s read the case , tell me can anyone answer question <#> ?"
"oh <UNK> , and by the time you quit it ’s whiskey <UNK> you’re <UNK>"
tell me first you got to ask yourself “ what is the decision you’re makin ?
today i need to report the loss of long - time local <UNK> bill law .
i was a student at bill law <UNK> and i had just wrapped up ground school this week at his facility .
"my thoughts and prayers go out to bill 's family , friends and employees ."
i had met and spoke with bill several times .
"a month of saturday 's ago my sons met him and my youngest nathan was more than happy to ask him questions ... especially about "" water planes "" ."
bill was kind and tried to answer nathan 's <UNK> as best he could .
bill <UNK> flight <UNK> that there were engine problems and he was trying to reach an <UNK> a few miles away ( <UNK> ) .
"witnesses say the plane <UNK> several trees , breaking off branches , and then hit the ground a few <#> yards from a section of houses ."
"bill was flying his twin engine <UNK> <UNK> , it burst into flames on impact ."
if you have been following my flight log you know that i have been frustrated with my flight instructor recently .
because of this issue i had already met and scheduled my flight training at a new school with a new instructor .
sadly the school that i will be attending at <UNK> air park is only a few miles from where bill 's plane went down .
as tragic as today 's event is i still want to pursue my dream of <UNK> and then earn my pilot certificate .
this event reminded me that bad things can happen to the best trained and most experienced <UNK> .
flying is as glorious as it is <UNK> .
"<UNK> there i 've chased the shouting wind along , and <UNK> my eager craft through <UNK> halls of air ."
it was a priority <#> ( red = lights and <UNK> ) to the same nursing home that were at last week .... this time minus the <UNK> .
"we were told of several injuries that they might have had , so we were planning ahead as to what we were going to need on scene ."
"once we got there we made sure that we brought a <UNK> , <UNK> , and few other items to the location just in case ."
the patient was in their <UNK> 's and injuries included a prior hip <UNK> .
they were on the floor but aware and alert enough to answer questions .
apparently they fell and most likely re - injured the previous injury .
we were actually pretty well organized and the lifting and loading went nicely .
it was a little strange to get a call like this .
earlier in the shift we talked briefly about whether it was better to die with all of your <UNK> or age to the point of being dependent on others ?
our patient had obviously chosen the latter ... or at least this path was chosen for them .
as time went by the <UNK> became more interesting .
our ice cream was waiting for us back a the base where we thought about whether it was better to die with all of your <UNK> or age ...
if i get to enjoy ice cream they way the patient was ... i'm all for aging !
we had a great view of the track from turn <#> and most importantly my son got to see his favorite <UNK> ...
so i figured why not make it a true event .
it 's always nice to see your child glow with excitement at seeing in person what he could only dream of before .
it was definitely a dream come true for the both of us ... and lots of fun .
win or lose ... just being there was all that mattered .
i noticed that i am writing way more than i intended in this blog .
i 'm torn between making this a personal log or a professional log since i had things happen that would cover both topics .
this stuff burned up about <#> <UNK> of my day and the rest i spent hunting down product images and <UNK> page <UNK> .
on a personal note ... i did get to i m with a nice lady from toronto named <UNK> .
i spent some time doing that but could n't afford to do it for a long time .... too much stuff to do .
but i know she reads this ... which is ok ...
i enjoyed our chat and want to learn more about her .
"she 's <#> and does n't need children of her own , but it 's ok that i have mine since she likes kids anyway ."
my kids already have a mother so there is no pressure to fill that void .
- time to hit the shower and then bed .
tonight was the last class of flight school for me .
i turned in my final and suffered through a badly taught class involving flight planning .
my flight instructor is moving out of her place into a place of her own away from the husband .
she ca n't fly this weekend because of this and i get to suffer for it .
i will get her sign off so that i can take the <UNK> written exam and move on ... move on to a different school that is .
"she 's already trying to get me to fly during the day , during the week ..."
well i have a job and i just ca n't swing that .
always a road block ... somewhere ... she 's really done downhill the last few weeks .
<UNK> <UNK> ... <UNK> <UNK> ... <UNK> the tee <UNK> ... since that was the level of support i received through my separation .
"this is my first "" personal "" blog log and it figures that i would wait until almost midnight to write it , so please excuse the <UNK> ."
i 'm going to keep this short and sweet .
i managed to <UNK> my lease today during lunch .
i made sure that it was a <#> - month lease just like the last <#> .
i got the nerve to ask about <UNK> since mine has had it !
perhaps they are going to do some <UNK> dating on it just to confirm its age !
"yes , they told me to call <#> - <#> - <#> and ask for animal control so they can come down and remove it ."
"why is it that for the mouse in the ceiling i call them , but for a bat i have to call <#> - <#> - <#> ."
in <#> minutes it 's going to be august 11th .
this would have been my 14th wedding anniversary if only that damn divorced did n't get in the way .
", when people find them , i wo n't have to worry about explaining what happened"
... they will see only the good and not the bad - and never be the wiser .
i also own my own <UNK> firm called urllink orlando web services .
as a <UNK> i have <UNK> many business <UNK> and local marketing agencies in developing and supporting their web <UNK> .
"my responsibilities generally include project planning , layout designing , content development , application training and ongoing site management and <UNK> ."
i currently serve <#> accounts as the lead account <UNK> for a complete internet marketing solution known as urllink <UNK> .
to date we have <#> accounts and are expanding our operations .
i will become the operations manager as soon as i can train someone like myself to take over my responsibilities .
i work too hard and need to get out and relax more ....
well it 's monday night and i am at the base again for my normal shift .
no waiting ... free pizza and chicken fingers along with ice cream .
i read through and <UNK> myself on chapters <#> and <#> in preparation for a quiz that i do n't need to take wednesday night .
i do n't want to blow off anything related to flying .
i want to go solo as soon as i 'm prepared mentally and from an education stand point .
dreams do come true ... and they can happen to you ... if you bust your butt ! ! !
well it 's sunday and i am at the base ... again .
great day for flying ... but no ! ! ! ! ! ! !
no calls today and i read <#> chapters for flight school .
"i was scheduled to go flying in about an hour and a half , but my flight instructor just cancelled today and sunday ."
"this is not cool , but i know she is going through issues at home so i will let it pass ."
i have plan b in my pocket if this continues ....
i know she loves flying as much as i do so i hope this is just a minor issue .
"plan b involves a newer plane at another field with a different instructor , it 's just amazing how much you can do on an extended lunch ."
i will see her on <#> and will see if she can go flying this saturday ... if not ...
i picked up the final exam to do at home and will turn it in on <#> .
the exam has <#> questions and i must get an <#> % to get my <UNK> sign off so that i can take the <UNK> written exam .
i have no doubt that i will pass and ca n't wait to get this the hell out of the way .
i volunteer at least <#> day a week at a local volunteer ambulance <UNK> .
my shift runs from <#> pm until <#> am the following morning .
this usually means home by 5:30 am and off to work by 7:30 am .
for the record i volunteer between <#> - <#> hours a month which is what i mean by insane .
an elderly woman with chest pains ... a red call ... an <UNK> tech on route from the big city
when we arrived on scene the elderly woman was sitting <UNK> in a wheel chair and was doing well .
"no breathing problems ... slight discomfort in a few places , but this apparently was going on for days and she picked this morning to call it in ."
"anyway , i called <UNK> and told the <UNK> tech to go green instead of red to the scene ."
we <UNK> the <UNK> and headed up toward the main road so that the <UNK> tech could see us easily .
a few minutes later she arrives and parks behind us .
i get out to help her with her gear and out of nowhere a pan <UNK> shows up on scene at <#> am to ask for change .
"no i do n't have change , but i do have a patient who is more important that him ."
he finally got the hint and went about his <UNK> behavior through a store parking lot .
we wrapped things up and headed into town with the patient safe and sound .
yesterday i logged <#> hours of flight time ... cost $ <#> .
"i accidently charged it on the wrong credit card , so i will have to fix that mistake <UNK> !"
total time logged to date : <#> hours general report well the day was n't too bad .
the weather was good and the wind was out of <#> at <#> <UNK> .
i <UNK> to <UNK> <#> and did my usual run - up .
i did a fairly good job with things up until that point .
i 'm still not very good at talking to <UNK> on the radio .
"i was in <UNK> ( known as <#> , charlie , echo ) which is turning into my favorite plane for some reason ."
i will have to take a picture of it for the blog sometime .
"anyway , my take off was good and i seemed to know what i was doing ."
it was around <UNK> pm and the sky was clear with <UNK> skies to the south ...
shortly at <#> feet we made it over the <UNK> near <UNK> and began a turn to <UNK> lake .
once we reached the lake we got stall fever and decided that i needed to practice a few .
"i am getting a little better at dealing mentally with them , there is just something about intentionally <UNK> a plane that does n't sit well with me ."
think of it as pulling back on the rains of a horse while on the edge of a <#> story <UNK> and you will get the idea .
once the stall horn goes off you know you are close ... then suddenly the plane goes down nose first .
it basically <UNK> a roller coaster in the sky .... but a roller coaster is much easier to handle .
we did this a few times and then went on to power - on <UNK> ( slightly better stuff ) and then <#> degree turns .
i think i <UNK> the <#> degree turns ... in fact i know i did because i felt my own wing <UNK> <UNK> as i pulled out of it

"long hours spent thinking of something meaningful to say , the endless typing , the <UNK> to be heard above the <UNK> and mindless media <UNK> ."
"but hey , that s why we expect to get the big bucks ."
after much thought i have an interesting question to pose - who are the people that actually read blogs ?
"is there a way to make money "" blogging "" ?"
"if you create a blog and no <#> reads it , do you really have a blog ?"
"what if you had a competition - a "" blog off "" ?"
"if you told someone to "" blog off "" would they be offended ?"

a professional blogger sees blogging as their only job possibility .
here are <UNK> from a recent interview with the <UNK> blogger .
<UNK> : it 's a thrill to finally meet a true professional blogger .
"i have all the ingredients that a pro blogger needs ; a computer , the internet , i can type and i have no other job ."

<UNK> blogger : yes ... do not just jump into this profession .
"its a "" blog eat blog "" world out there ."
<UNK> blogger : my ultimate objective is to become a symbol and <UNK> for all the professional bloggers out there .

we got into the car and drove out into the world of employment .

"thanks <UNK> , for the moving text thingy , there at the top ."
"so sign my <UNK> guest book , then !"
"good afternoon , ms j. attitude , it seems , is everything ."
what was it i wrote a few posts ago ?
""" it 's your attitude , not your <UNK> , that <UNK> your <UNK> . """
"it 's not an original dale - <UNK> , but it is quite true ."
i 'd been slowly <UNK> myself into a blue funk these past <#> days .
"my dear friend <UNK> called this morning to check on me and ask if there was anything i needed and dan has been incredibly helpful , god love him ."
he 's prepared meals and gone to fetch groceries and medicine .
"i chatted a while with urllink <UNK> this morning and she was , as always , <UNK> and positive ."

he set his suitcase down and brushed his shoulder length hair away from his face .

""" where are you going to put his food , dan ?"
"i wo n't be cleaning that or feeding him , you know ."
"he 's your responsibility . "" "" she , dad ."
i reached around and pulled the cold pack from under my back .
i had to lift my bottom off the floor to do it and it hurt like hell .
"dan took the cat , an orange <UNK> , out of the cage and the <#> of them <UNK> the house ."
i 'm tired of looking at the <UNK> ceiling .
"he was nervous i guess , about starting a new life here with me ."
he 's visited me many times before but only for a couple of days at a time .
my home has not been his home for more than a decade .
"i tried to listen to him , but soon it was like listening to someone reading the telephone directory ."
an idea occurred to me then for a self - help group aimed at people who talk too much .
"i 'd call it "" on and on <UNK> "" ."
and i felt guilty as sin for entertaining such thoughts .
"he 's my son , for goodness sake ! but talk ! !"
"good <UNK> <UNK> day , that boy can talk ."
i 'll bet he could talk the ear off a <UNK> .
"when he was younger , i used to fear he 'd get his tongue <UNK> outdoors ."
i 'm going to offer him my hand and welcome him to my home .
then i 'm going to ask him when he plans on getting a job .
all it took was a simple phone call .
"the web site says it 's a free service , but that 's not completely accurate ."
i 'll have to pay for the long distance phone call .
it was a north american number i <UNK> .
urllink <UNK> let 's all do it !
"i was lying on the couch a while ago , watching tv and resting my back , when there came a <UNK> knock on the door ."
"then the door opened a crack and i heard the <UNK> of a child in great distress . "" dale ! dale ! """
it was the neighbour lady from across the street .
"the remote control and the <UNK> telephone both slid off my stomach onto the <UNK> , spilling a cup of <UNK> tea ."
""" gary just shoved a <UNK> up his nose and i ca n't get it out ."

"she sounded quite panic - <UNK> , ms j. the boy was <UNK> and i did n't hear her clearly at first . """
"how the hell did he do that ? """
"b - e - a - d . """
"that made more sense , although not much ."
i 'd rather have eaten a bowl of stones than to have gotten off that couch and into the car .
it 'll take me half an hour to get off this couch .
"do you want some money for a cab ? """
""" i 'll find somebody to drive us ."
""" i listened as she lead the screaming boy away ."
"right away , i heard her ask another neighbour and seconds later , they were off ."
"i felt badly that i could n't help her , ms j. but what could i do ?"
my back is worse now than it was earlier .
i called work and told them i wo n't be in tomorrow .
so that 's <#> day 's pay shot to hell .
i 'll take some more <UNK> and go to bed .
"i 'm having a bit of a challenging evening , ms journal ."
i was out with a friend this afternoon .
we were downtown by the <UNK> walking through a beautiful garden and <UNK> the flowers .
"i said , "" oh look at these ones , linda . """
and i bent to examine the <UNK> more closely .
"i snapped a quick photo and when i stood up again , there was pain ."

"takes your breath away , does n't it ?"
"i do n't imagine it would be in the freezer , would it ?"
urllink <UNK> | is fahrenheit <#> <UNK> for an oscar ?
i seriously believe that this picture should not only be nominated but <UNK> deserves to win .
i would not be suprised if in few years down the road this movie would be used as an educational tool for our <UNK> in describing bush 's presidency .
"it was entertaining , tough <UNK> , and down right scary ."
i enjoyed it and i believe it should be shown on american tv .
overall the movie deserves an oscar and should get it .
so i started by telling her there are <#> ways of looking at this .
"he created the earth , the sun and the moon ."
"the water the animals and then a man , adam ."
"he then took the <UNK> of adam and created the woman , eve ."
"then i continued , the other way is to believe in <UNK> theory of evolution ."
this means we are all evolved from each other .
that we all evolved to what we are today from something we were before .
"i said some <UNK> became birds and <UNK> , and we evolved from the <UNK> ."
she maid it very clear that she liked the biblical version so much better .
i guess there are answers that are ok when you are <#> .
"i still feel good having exposed her to a notion she may not comprehend today , yet it will be familiar when the notion is more acceptable ."
i think all answers should be given with a bit of truth even if just <UNK> .
"i am glad that she has been exposed to a organized religion , since it gives her the basic moral values to live by ."
yet i want her to be curious enough to pose questions and be exposed to different answers .
"in few years <UNK> may make more sense , but today i like the <UNK> innocence still <UNK> in her ."
me and my family consume <#> <#> gallon water bottles a week .
obviously they charge me a deposit for every bottle .
"well , we at times have <#> to <#> empty bottles in the house and i load the car up and take them to the store ."
well lately i had been given a really hard time in returning them .
i was told that i could only return as many as i was purchasing etc .
"each and every time the "" rules "" became more and more difficult ."
"finally i had it , i asked for a manager and after a very long time he showed up ."
he explained to me that there had been a re <UNK> theft of water from his store .
he said that since i clearly was not the gut then there would be no reason to suspect me and i could continue to return my bottles .
"needless to say my husband is still a suspect , due to the gender issue ."
"i told the manager that since the bottles were purchased there , then they should be able to be returned there also ."
after a couple of weeks i went back again with empty bottles .
i was not given a hard time this time but they all knew whom i was .
"i had loved the anonymous of my visits , and i did not appreciate being recognized ."
well this bothered me so much that i emailed <UNK> and email sharing my concerns with they 're policy of treating the water customers as potential criminals .
i got a message from the store manager that he wanted to talk .
"then my husband spoke with the district manager , whom said he would look into it ."
i did not immediately return the store managers message .
we left the house to spend a afternoon shopping .
"when i got home , i noticed that the gate to our backyard was open , and i feared the dog had gotten loose ."
"dog had not <UNK> , but i could not figure why the usually locked gate , was now open ."
"when i got in there was a message from the store manager "" i stopped by your hours "" this freaked me out ."
"certainly i had included my address , they could have sent me an letter of apology , not a stalking <UNK> store manager ."
he kept on <UNK> that he wanted to shake our hands ....
he wanted to come to our house again ..... absolutely not said my husband .
"anyway the whole moral of this story is ...... do not dear to complain , in writing"
..... the manager may be a stalker .... you would think that they hire managers that know not to <UNK> on customers homes .
chew your word ; i am so upset with myself right now .
less then an hour ago i raised my voice in a conversation with my mother and now i feel absolutely awful about it .
and when it is done by someone who i care about it is even more painful .
may we all learn to chew our words before speaking them .
"loving america , flipping a <UNK> i’d say to love america is to know her ."
at the very minimum i take knowing and understanding america as a personal responsibility .
there is a liberal casey within me that wants all american borders to be open so everybody <UNK> my love <UNK> could come here .
"come here and live freely , speak without fear , pay a fear tax and achieve their full potential ."
but the conservative casey <UNK> him and his <UNK> wishes saying that america as a nation is limited and can not <UNK> everyone .
"yet the <UNK> casey <UNK> that america as an idea , a phenomenon , or a state of understanding is <UNK> and <UNK> ."
so i aim to learn all that i can about what makes america successful .
i plan to post my thoughts here so that the collective help of the internet community could help me on my mission .
these may open the way for further discussion .
american strength is based on respect for contract law and personal property .
in america you can start a business in your garage or your kitchen knowing that you will be the sole <UNK> .
by coming to america people were able to break away from all the <UNK> aspects of their original culture and start a fresh life .
those who work for a living going paycheck to paycheck and looking forward to a <#> - week vacation a year will never become a part of the elite .
they might as well work and live anywhere else in the world as long as they spend their income within the american economy .
real americans are a special bread of people who are always striving and never get tired .
a real american will not quit working and producing after he/she becomes a <UNK> .
"wealth <UNK> is just a <UNK> , a way to keep score in this game ."
"you lose , i win , now lets find another game ."
well it ’s 3:30 in the morning and i have to be on the way to work by <#> <UNK> .
so let me stop here and pick this up another day .
please feel free to e - mail me and tell me what you think .
"thanks , casey , an <UNK> by birth and an american by choice ."
i had a good appointment with k this past week .
"we had missed a week because she was gone , so i was sort of feeling like there was so much to cover and not knowing where to start ."
ended up with us talking about <UNK> ( not a suprise ... ) and me for most of the time .
"i change out the items all the time , but am always wearing something . and <#> % of the reason i wear it is because of <UNK> ..."
"i wear either something he gave me , or something that has <UNK> meaning to him and i on it pretty much all the time ."
<UNK> now to the lessons i feel i need to learn within this relationship .
"i came up with <#> possibilities , which actually leads to <#> ... let me see if i can sum them up ."
"the idea of the lesson being to walk away is really the "" easier "" of the <#> ... and it really is just the complex expressing itself ..."
"the no trust , fear of getting hurt complex ... its not really a lesson now is it ."
"i need to learn patience , self <UNK> and trust , while at the same time learning to speak up for myself ."
* * * i ca nt pick easy lessons now can i ?
* * * * * * we also discussed how this relationship <UNK> and i have really in all its <UNK> has some good sides .
"okay people , i think i am a little pms so here it goes ."
"it is friday afternoon , i have been working on paperwork all day ."
it is this ridiculous sales program i am doing right now .
the moral to this story is find a company land line .
the fact that i use over <#> minutes a month blows my mind . that is over <#> hours a day on the phone .
"now i am in sales and i do n't have a land line , but this is ridiculous ."
"i am learning to leave my cell at home , which is <UNK> of these days ."
i got a job interview call while riding .
they just should n't be able to find me at all times .
you actually can relax a bit when the phone stays home .
i am having an out of body experience because this stuff is <UNK> not me .
"this guy can not stop talking about his kids , about himself , and how <UNK> he is at sales ."
"blah blah <UNK> .... "" i want you to realize you have to keep focused on <UNK> results """
""" i found that i was more concerned with getting it done other than the quality "" what is this shit rocket science ."
"i understand sales is a purely self - motivated activity , it requires discipline , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i ca n't believe i am listening to this stuff right now ... i feel like tony <UNK> is barking in my ear .... same type of gig .
""" you should be learning some things about what makes your "" recipe "" for sales work for you "" challenge what you do ."
"i am completely and utterly unsure as to what i am doing here , but that is okay ."
that is pretty much status <UNK> for most things .
i read a little bit about blogging and i thought ....
"man , i love to talk , communicate , voice my opinion ."
i am going to talk a little bit about myself and see what happens .
"well , as the title indicates i am <#> ."
"no big deal really , i feel <#> and i believe i look somewhere in between ."
"i am single , have an <UNK> job and looking for the meaning of life ."
nothing too out of the ordinary going on around here .
"what i find <UNK> interesting is that this mid - life "" crisis "" thing is an actual real thing ."
"i really do n't feel it is a crisis , but an <UNK> of the mind to questioning what we are doing with our lives ."
"the stuff i read indicates that it is completely "" normal "" especially with women ."
<UNK> we really come into ourselves at <#> .
a person ’s time is their most valuable <UNK> and yours is appreciated .
i want to talk to you about <UNK> ( fm ) and chronic <UNK> pain syndrome ( <UNK> ) .
"many have never heard of these conditions and for those who have , many are <UNK> . and"
because of this <UNK> are made that may not be <UNK>
"my pain works silently , stealing my joy and replacing it with tears . on the outside"

if you take the time to spend with me you will see that .
i love to tell that joke to make another ’s face light up and smile at my wit .
i love my kids and <UNK> and shine when they give me my hugs or ask me to fix their favorite toy .
i am fun to be with if you will spend the time with me on my own playing field ; is this too much to ask ?
i love you and want nothing more than to be a part of your life .

"it 's a very busy day today , but then every day is like this lately ."
"i wish the rain would stop so i can the house finished , at least the parts that i am doing ."
well another day of just catching up on work around the house .
i finally got my clothes put away and my room cleaned .
<UNK> all the litter boxes and cleaned them also .
the only thing left is <UNK> the grass and maybe work on starting the second coat of <UNK> on the garage .
all the other parts i have gotten the first coat on .
as long <UNK> i stay busy then i do n't have time to think about them .
well i may have been paid back but time will tell for them .
like they say you ca n't treat someone like garbage and it 's not going to come back <#> fold to you .
you ca n't dog someone and break their heart and step on them like they are nothing and it will not come back to haunt you .
they may be the happy couple now but it will not last because it is just the way it is .
i am working so hard on moving on in my life .
it has been a very hard road to walk but i am getting better every day .
that s not to say i do n't have bad days still because just thinking of them together and what they have put me through is the worst .
i have had people come to me that they would never even think would .
i have been told about all the times they were seen at each others house and all the times chris stayed at her house behind my back .
all the weekends i was staying there she was just using me .
now i know why we slept in different rooms .
it all adds up <UNK> a fool i was always running back to her and kissing ass just so her and chris could laugh behind my back .
i never imagined some of the things i have been told was going on .
these are <UNK> people to because they were close enough to see what was going on the whole time .
even the <UNK> chris and i just missed passing each other .
god all i had to do was go back to her house for something or make a surprise visit .
oh well i need to quit thinking about it because like i said they will get theirs some day .
they will get treated as they have treated me .
i do n't go no where because of the chance of running into them .
my daughter said if she is with me and they say <#> word to me she is going to tell them both off .
elizabeth <UNK> hates <UNK> for what she has done .
now it 's time for me to start living again and forget about them and all their dirty deeds .
i will find someone to love me for me and not want or need their ex in their life to keep them happy .
if i could do it all over again boy would i have ran away from <UNK> the day i met her .
but <UNK> i just let myself fall in love with her only to get kicked in the teeth by both of them .
i guess you could say i really am an ass for letting myself be takin in be all the crap and lines and i love you
but i have to admit they had a good game going for a long time .
i was just at the <UNK> of my heart and tearing my world apart .
it has been <#> months and <#> days since that <UNK> night .
me i can understand because she had what she wanted in her life but to not even think about a little boy who she supposedly cared about is <UNK> .
"that i will never forgive her for , till the day i die ."
another long day at work . still working <#> hour days .
well it 's been <#> months since <UNK> dumped me for her ex girl friend chris .
i guess i never really knew what a game player <UNK> really was untill this all happened .
i guess i should of known it was going to happen .
i was always catching them together under the <UNK> that nothing happened .
you do n't just start a relationship with your ex if you have been away from each other for <#> years .
they were always together it was just done so <UNK> behind my back .
i have to admit they were good at cheating on me for the last few years with out me catching them .
i never thought she was so evil and cold hearted .
but i have since found out she is a very cold <UNK> woman .
i found out so many things from people that even i would n't have thought <UNK> were doing behind my back .
i would n't let her have me and chris so she had to make a decision and it was n't me .
i would n't bow down and kiss her ass like chris will .
i am not sure if this changes my world yet or not .
but i fear the <UNK> will get to him .
i prefer to be low key and just do my job behind the scenes .
remember me on pay day and at <UNK> time .
i used to have management dreams but it seems <#> has to sell pieces of their very soul to be in management at times .
is there no such thing as ethical and management in the same breath ?
i know some managers for whom i have a great deal of respect .
there there are the bone headed ones who make decisions with out really giving it any thought .
i have survived many management changes and with some exceptions i have been here longer than most managers .
so i will probably survive this <#> as well .
on another site i have kept a diary on i used to receive so many responses to my entries .
"so if i was hoping for comments from others , i obviously need to "" go back where i came from ."
""" here i will just post to hear my self think and if someone comments so be it ."
these things are more fun when they are interactive .
"well , no use keeping it a secret ."
i have this dream of a house built on my folks ' land .
i am tired of renting . and i want a place where the kids and the dogs can <UNK> free without worry .
so living in the country is the ticket i think .
saturday we went to <UNK> to visit a <UNK> home <UNK> .
strangely i was impressed until they gave me the price .
currently around here it costs about $ <#> to $ <#> per square foot to build a house .
<UNK> cost between $ <#> and $ <#> per square foot to build .
so we thought this might put us under the magic number i have in my head as far as <UNK> goes .
with <#> kids so far with plans for just <#> more we want a house with <#> <UNK> . that way every <#> gets their own room .
also we want the garden tub in the master bedroom and walk - in <UNK> .
it is not so much to ask but it costs to much to dream about .
i want to build a stone or brick fence around the yard and have a long drive way with oak trees planted on both sides .
kind of like <#> <UNK> in gone with the wind .
i want to be in <#> place and never have to worry about having to every move again .
i have been divorced before so of course it <UNK> at me the idea of building a house to share with my new wife on my family 's land .
i do n't want anything to ever take that land away .
it is n't made of gold and it does n't have oil underneath it but i still want it to always be in my family .
i would love to buy even more land .
while editing my profile i received the random question : the children are waiting !
he looked at himself in the mirror every day .
""" i am the most handsome frog in the entire <UNK> , "" he would say . "" <UNK> say"
""" i am the most handsome frog in the <UNK> . """
he then jumped onto the same log as the frog of the <UNK> .
""" i am the most handsome frog anyone has ever seen ."
"call up all your friends and you will see what i mean . """
it was then the handsome frog of the <UNK> realized he had no friends at all .
never to be seen in the <UNK> again .
sometimes it is hard to belive something that you ca n't see .
i believe we are the result of a big bang .
but i also believe in the biblical creation as well .
the bible does n't go into great detail about how everything was created .
it is a pretty loose story as far as details go .
and it says god created it all in <#> days .
how can we expect a higher power who has been around from forever to <UNK> to have a concept of time .
for him to keep up with time would mean it would probably drag on .
we do not have the full mental capacity to understand god .
in fact often when i try to imagine how it all came to be and try to put some understanding to it my head hurts .
the <UNK> believed when we die we gain all the knowledge there is to know .
when we are born again we lose that knowledge and spend our lives trying to gain it all back .
it does n't mean i am a smart person it just means i claim to have some rhyme or reason to my thought processes .
i have to think things out to the nth degree before i make up my mind .
to me there is absolutely no way there is n't a god .
i believe sort of like the <UNK> that god created it all based on rules he determined .
god could have created it all anyway he wanted .
so what if he used the big bang to create the universe and then he used evolution to create all animals upon the earth ?
the original bible stories are put together by <UNK> to teach as well to keep their followers in line .
often these were written from <UNK> that had been passed on by word of mouth before the written word .
i believe all of these words were influenced by god .
nearly every religion has some punishment and reward system .
i believe if we live a good life and do good unto others we will go to heaven .
if we do evil and wrong we will go to hell .
and i believe going to church or <UNK> re - <UNK> our beliefs and helps us to continue to do well .
"we may be god 's soap opera , but so what ."
and with <UNK> it is up to us to seek him out and not god to see us out .
i really want to get into video editing .
i spent a few bucks to get the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> video editing software .
granted this is n't <UNK> or final cut or anything like that .
i bought <UNK> studio <#> and i bought the mega pack .
i still like the software but when you buy the <UNK> pack you assume this means you get the <UNK> package .
so anyway i shot movies of family and events and such for fun .
but i would like to do it for profit .
there are only so many hours in a day .
i think i will be smart and go to bed .
"i mean , what the heck is the song even about ?"
either way this song is such a cool <UNK> song .
i bought the traffic greatest hits album and this song was n't on it .
later a new greatest hits was released and it was on there .
how many long songs are there worth listening to ?
but i ca n't really post my private thoughts into a public forum .
<UNK> what is the use to have a thought you want to make public and put it into a private diary .
the coin always has <#> sides unless you count the thin edge .
as time goes on i will post more .
tonight i just wanted to set it all up .
"= <#> percent so , therefore , i must ask : was bill clinton a racist ?"
"so , as a result , we again have the party of "" racial unity "" versus the party of <UNK> , no ?"
"i have only <#> additional <UNK> , then : which party is which ?"
note : data available urllink here and urllink here .
<#> - bill clinton average un employment rates - jan .
"1st through july <UNK> : whites - <#> percent blacks - <#> percent <UNK> - <#> percent women - <#> ah , yes ."
"the party of racial and gender "" diversity "" versus the the party of . ."
note : data urllink here and urllink here .
the latest measure of consumer confidence rose <UNK> from the level at which it came in last month .
"yes , virginia , mainstream americans know whether or not they have jobs ."
and they know whether their personal financial conditions are good or poor .
"well , then , it would seem to me that , at least regarding economic issues , clinton did a pretty <UNK> job on behalf of his <UNK> ."
"note : * on these particular issues , the <UNK> 's <UNK> data does not go back further than <#> ."
i was visiting toronto a couple of weeks back and i noticed something about the drivers .
they don’t give other drivers a whole lot of room for error .
"if you even start to do something wrong , you’ll get the horn , and you’ll get it loud ."
"at first it took me by surprise how much people were <UNK> , and how quickly ."
i was expecting extreme errors in judgment that were near miss accidents .
"most times , however , the <UNK> driver was just making a bad call ."
"they would hesitate on a turn signal , or make a quick turn from the wrong lane , and the horn would <UNK> ."
it got me thinking about the differences in driver mentality around the country .
"i live in <UNK> where , although we have bad drivers , we are very patient with other people ’s mistakes ."
we are more than willing to sit and wait for someone to make a turn in a no - turning lane .
"if you get cut off , which is often , we’ll yell at you through the windshield , but rarely <UNK> ."
"actually , i can’t remember the last time i heard someone else use their horn in <UNK> . when i had returned from my trip"
", i decided that i would experiment with the horn ."
"after all , it comes standard on every vehicle and is there for a reason , why not use it ."
"so , i started <UNK> when people made errors in judgment ."
it was interesting to note the nasty looks i received from other drivers .
some were surprised to hear a <UNK> and searched their mirrors for the <UNK> .
others gave me <UNK> looks – even though they were <UNK> along with me .
i guess part of the reason we don’t use the horn here is because things are rarely backed up .
"you don’t usually have traffic <UNK> ( unless there ’s an accident ) ,"
"so if someone takes a little longer to react to a green light , it ’s not such a bad thing ."
"also , there is a lot of space between cars ."
you need <UNK> to make horn blowing effective .
"many times , i just plain old forgot to hit the horn ."
it takes conscious effort to recognize that there is a horn - <UNK> opportunity in the making and i need to react .
"if you take too long , you’ve missed the moment ."
<UNK> after the fact is just plain stupid .
i don’t think <UNK> will catch on here in <UNK> .
"i was annoyed by my own horn , so i only used it a couple of times ."
"hey , at least i get my frustration out ."
"so , what are you - <UNK> or <UNK> ?"
i’ve been doing some research into my personality type lately .
"well , because … that ’s what kind of person i am ."
"anyways , i had always thought that an <UNK> was someone who was <UNK> ."
"you know the type , always talking to everyone at parties , seems to know the whole world ."
"i was quite shy as a young adult , so i <UNK> people that were like that ."
"<UNK> , on the other hand , was the shy type ."
this was the type of person <UNK> end up living alone in a house full of cats .
"gee , i wonder why people like to be considered <UNK> and don’t typically like to be called <UNK> ."
"in reality , however , how <UNK> you are , or how shy you are does not really define whether you are <UNK> or <UNK> ."
"although <UNK> do tend to be more outgoing , it doesn’t mean you have to be mr . or mrs ."
the difference has to do with how you get your energy .
"if you are the type of person who needs to interact with the world to get things resolved , then you’re most likely an <UNK> ."
"if you need to sit down , on you own , and just work through the problem in your head , then you may be an <UNK> ."
"your interaction with the outside world , whether it is internal or external , will define what type of personality you are ."
do you need to get it all off your chest or do you need to just be left alone so that you can work it all out ?
i guess the best way to explain this would be to give you an example .
i woke up this morning at about 7:00 am and started thinking about the whole <UNK> thing .
i thought it would be a good idea to share this on the web so i immediately started to ponder what i would write .
i mentally wrote the article as i brushed my teeth .
my thoughts danced from idea to idea and drifted off into <UNK> as i made my morning coffee .
"what i would say would <UNK> around in my mind , but the full dialogue would never come together ."
i work through my post as if i am having a conversation with all of you .
"if i didn’t write this out , i would be thinking about it all day ."
it would slowly start to eat away at me until i found another outlet .
"generally , this would be my poor wife , claire -"
she has to put up with all my crazy ideas and interests .
"the fact that i needed to share this with others , to express it out to the world , is an example of my <UNK> - ness ."
"it ’s not enough to just get this straight in my own head , i need an audience ."
"now that i finally got this down on paper , i feel somewhat lighter ."
it ’s as if a weight has been lifted from me .
i would never get this kind of feeling from just thinking it through .
how many of the people here consider themselves <UNK> ?
"every time i see that <UNK> drew <UNK> film never been kissed , i get all <UNK> during the end scene on the <UNK> <UNK> ."
what 's worse is that i feel compelled to share this information with strangers over the internet .
so now you have something to hold over me if i ever lose my mind and join the <UNK> .
"this evening i also took , of all things , urllink <UNK> 's knitting quiz ."
"urllink video game poster featuring semi - naked man <UNK> sword <UNK> mother , <UNK> <UNK> child ."
"to celebrate , i spent <#> hours watching movies on <UNK> 's free movie channel last night ."
"steve martin 's <UNK> , and john <UNK> 's short but excellent"
"i 've either read these , or had hoped to but now have some other books to read instead ."
last night i packed up the last of the small items from the old apartment .
we all spent the next <#> hours drinking beer on the front step .
it was a nice way to say good - bye to the old place .
"my <UNK> for this <UNK> with the <UNK> age gap between myself and the typical graduate school student is that apparently , to them , i look <#> ."
you can tell that i 'm having age issues this week .
"that , or i 'm turning in to michael douglas ."
"is the last time i lived in campus housing , which is where all the partying was going on back then ."
funny how weird that seems when i stop and think about it .
i had a look at the new campus apartment this morning and i think i 'll really enjoy living there .
"sadly , this boring news is all i have to write about ."
"since i 've done a good job moving stuff today , however , i can go enjoy another <#> of those movies ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , which i watched part of this morning , really is great fun ."
"though i always confuse the title with that drew <UNK> film , urllink <UNK> differences ."
"i bet you do the same thing , do n't you ?"
"<#> things a person should not do : grocery shop when hungry , and go to the video rental store when avoiding packing ."
i loves movies almost as much as i loves making urllink goo - goo eyes with sexy library girls .
"my <#> day weekend starts tomorrow , which is only the first part of a <#> week break from library school ."
"i have to pack and move , sure ."
"but i also get to read for fun , send out job <UNK> , watch movies , sleep in , and go through my email inbox ."
i get to visit <UNK> in <UNK> and see off my friend stacey who is portland - bound .
now we find out if that 's gonna work .
"at the very least i had a day this week when i did n't have to be on campus , and"
today has been <UNK> too : i spent it mostly pre - packing and playing the <UNK> <UNK> .
"<UNK> left for home this afternoon , and stacey leaves tomorrow ."
feelings about my friends leaving are mixing with memories of arriving in <UNK> this time last year .
"it will take some time to think about , but i 'm both excited for our respective <UNK> and sad to see this time together end ."
you are never quite the same away from college as you are in it .
the people you meet seem somehow more part of you and the experiences seem more genuine .
i spent a lot of time after college wondering why i was n't making more of the types of connections i made then .
"but i hope it finds you well and at the very least , <UNK> the <UNK> ."
the weather is ridiculously perfect - caught between <#> seasons at once .
everything around us is deciding what it wants to be and where it wants to go next .
<#> problem is that my birth state will never be taken as anything more than an <UNK> . knowing a woman <UNK> with this type of set - up
", however , i feel it 's fair to say the roles women receive in these marriages are , you know , less than <UNK> ."
am i being all <UNK> about a future <UNK> - winning program ?
i 'm <UNK> that probably <#> out of every <#> women i met in college had experienced a form of sexual abuse at a point in their lives .
i know men who have experienced sexual abuse .
"not all these people are from utah , of course , but the topic gets me up enough to talk about it here ."
some things must just seem funnier when you 're pitching them to a television production company .
or maybe this will turn out to be a program that will help people get help .
"i do n't know , it could be <UNK> <UNK> for our times ."
"continuing a topic from the urllink 9th , george bush <UNK> in on urllink <UNK> <UNK> ( mp3 audio ) . or tries to ."
part <#> : will you seek <UNK> off ?
"courtesy of sports <UNK> , urllink here 's a completely random example of published writing that got me thinking about the topic again ."
only the details of his life without the products seem vague .
"my vote went to an urllink alan <UNK> novel , urllink dark star ."
here 's the truth about my sunday morning <UNK> ... for the most part ... <UNK> <#> <UNK> evening in the not far enough past
", i 'm pretty well <UNK> when out on the town . with the exception of acting the fool on the dance floor ."
"i 'm quite aware of the fact that i look like i 'm on "" crack cocaine "" but here 's another truth ..."
i simply do n't care what people think when they see me dance .
it 's all about fun and it does n't hurt anyone so there ( sticking tongue out and <UNK> my nose ) .
"so , about last night , we had the best time !"
<UNK> 's hubby headed out to a <UNK> bake or some such thing so it was just us girls .
"the band at the event was this group of young boys called , "" the <UNK> spencer band "" and they were hot ."
when we arrived it was still fairly early so we got to just sit back and listen for a bit
i doubt that anyone in the band was over <#> yet they played a terrific selection of rock tunes from my <#> 's and even earlier .
"<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , pink <UNK> ( awesome job of another brick in the wall )"
the later you lay your head on the pillow the earlier your child is likely to rise .
so from 7:00 am till about <UNK> am i tried to talk her into coming in bed with me ... usually she loves mommy 's bed .
"she 'll often say , "" <UNK> come in with the waves mommy ? """
( i have a <UNK> ) but not this morning ... this morning
"so i dragged my "" tired but "" out of bed and we made for the living room ."
the rest of my day i spent doing the chores that got neglected yesterday in favor of hanging out with the kids .
"hope you had a great weekend and try not to work too hard this week , eh !"
myself i will probably panic on monday morning as i log into my computer for my first shift .
"in the meantime , it 's friday and that means in a few short hours i get to hang out with the girls for the weekend ."
"after work , we changed and went to the beach with my sister and her kids ."
we hung out there for a couple of hours and then went out to eat .
i love the beach ... but hate the sand in my shoes afterwards ( and the many other places i find it ) .
<#> . i love not having to cook when i 've had a long day ....
"but , for the most part , i hate take - out food ."
it 's the weekend and there 's a lot to do around the house .
we finished <UNK> and painting the kitchen last tuesday but i have not had a chance to get everything back in it 's <UNK> place .
i intend to put a lot less back then was originally there and intend to trim in other areas as well including the computer room and the living room .
"however , i love hanging out on the deck while the kids play in the yard and do not consider that lost time at all"
"so if we spend quality time together , chores get put off and the furniture <UNK> a little extra dust ... so be it ."
it is suppose to rain so we might actually get some things accomplished around the house and if not we 'll have fun ignoring the work .
thanks for reading ... that 's all i have for today .
i have long known of blogs but did n't really know what a blog was .
i probably still do n't but it seems like it might be a fun concept .
"my thoughts , dreams , opinions , and random ideas appearing in print and potentially available to the masses ."
<UNK> .... today i started the training updates for a new contract that i will be working on .
so far the only thing new is that i 'm freezing to death as the <UNK> is blasting the room with cold air .
perhaps if i was not freezing i would be able to concentrate on what 's being said in the classroom and actually learn something .
i suspect i would as the trainer is <#> i 've had before and is usually a very good teacher .
i suppose i should confess that part of the problem may infact be my own fault .
i did n't exactly get the best sleep last night so my <UNK> to cope with the chilly room and focus beyond that is <UNK> .
went to bed late and then the baby woke several times during the night .
"i always say , "" i 'm going to go to bed early and get a good sleep ."
part of the reason is that i do n't like going to bed .
but it seems either way i 'll be tired and by staying up late i avoid the lying in bed thinking about things part .
i promise i 'll try to do better next time .
", i know . this movie came out like <#> years ago , but i finally just saw it ."
i had been avoiding it because i just knew i was going to dislike it or that it would be seriously weak .
i liked it and it was n't even slightly weak .
the urllink news today is a- buzz about a controversial supreme court ruling that struck down a texas law against <UNK> .
texas <UNK> had argued that the state was entitled to <UNK> public morality and that <UNK> on homosexual acts were a <UNK> u.s .
"seems to me that if texas really wants to <UNK> "" traditional family values , "" it should start by cracking down on heterosexual acts outside of marriage ."
"... but that would ruin the lives of too many politicians , now would n't it ?"
i received an update today from the social security administration .
the notice listed out how much money i 've made over the years and how much of that was collected from me and my <UNK> .

spike lee is <UNK> <UNK> ( owners of the new urllink <UNK> ) over their choice of name for their <UNK> guy - oriented channel : spike tv .
a name like that could only lead people to assume that spike lee is involved ( in someone 's mind ) and so mr .

"honestly , when i heard about spike tv for the first time , i thought of the late spike jones ."

but i have to wonder what is the point of increasing <UNK> and face time for a site if it is n't commercial ?
"( whew , that took a little longer than usual . )"
many years ago ( when <UNK> <UNK> the earth and i was in my early twenties )
i remember telling people that there were <#> things i would never do : i would never own a cell phone .
"cell phones in the <UNK> were expensive and , frankly , status symbols ."
i would never live on a <UNK> - de - <UNK> .
"for many of the same reasons above , i saw life in the ' <UNK> and more evidence of <UNK> consumption and wanted no part of it at all ."
"the ultimate driving machine was , in my mind , the ultimate <UNK> machine ."
"my motto was "" die <UNK> <UNK> ! """
"so you might wonder how i 'm doing so far on my list of things i 'm "" never going to do ."
"in fact , i cancelled my old - fashioned <UNK> phone line and rely on the mobile phone exclusively ."
i live an a fabulous home in the ' <UNK> on a <UNK> - de - <UNK> .
"someday if i give up my motorcycle <UNK> , i might have to own <#> of those too ."
i 've grown up ( a little ) and have found that i have certain <UNK> needs .
what does all of this have to do with anything ?
"well , almost nothing actually ... but you have stayed with me this far so i might as well get to the point ."
he thinks that mobile phones are annoying and <UNK> .
"someday soon , i may be the last man in america without a cell phone ."
"to those who see cell phones as progress , i say : they <UNK> noise pollution and threaten our solitude ."
the central idea of cell phones is that you should be connected to almost everyone and everything at all times .
the trouble is that cell phones assault your peace of mind no matter what you do .
"if you turn them off , why have <#> ? you just <UNK> anyone who might call ."
"if they 're on and no <#> calls , you 're irrelevant , <UNK> or both ."
"if everyone calls , you 're a basket case ."
"while i think he makes valid points , he 's ignoring a few others ."
"for instance , just because you have a cell phone"
does n't mean that you have to answer it when it rings or that you even have to let it ring .
"if not , they can go to voice jail and i 'll call their voice jail at a time of my choosing ."
<UNK> <UNK> that people talk on their phones in restaurants and other public places .
i do n't see these <UNK> as evidence of evil <UNK> technology as much as i see them as just poor social skills .
choose your conversation times and topics carefully and you wo n't often offend where <UNK> is required or expected .
there 's really no need to bury your electronic head in the sand .
my <UNK> will call your <UNK> and they 'll do lunch sometime .
so i thought i would try an exercise with her with color -- colored <UNK> and paper to be exact .
"i find with this particular friend , she thinks better in images than words ."
i had her pick colors and then draw an object .
we concluded that with the <UNK> she drew she was telling of what she was going through .
"now , i knew it was going to rain when we moved here ."
i suppose it is still the <UNK> from hurricane alex .
just the sky is so dark . makes it for such a <UNK> day .
the rain coming down so hard it looks like a fire hose is on .
"he has all these theories about how things work , how things are , how things come to be ."
that magical time of night when everyone has gone to sleep and i get a moment 's peace to <UNK> and write .
i have been keeping journals since i was <#> .
in my <UNK> year in high school i had a teacher named sophie raven .
i got published in the high school literary magazine and have continued to be published online and continue my writing to this day .
"today , my mood <UNK> the storms and weather today ."
hurricane alex is off the carolina 's and we 're getting these <UNK> storms .
"the rain comes in fast and furious and then leaves again -- so to my moods , in and out fast ."
"i spent most of the day listening to <UNK> <UNK> , an indian artist that <UNK> trip - hop with <UNK> tunes and deep lyrics ."
"if you 'd like to read more about <UNK> <UNK> , urllink click here ."
"as i sit in the dark , writing , my mind <UNK> again , my heart <UNK> to be close , to feel , to explore ."
i feel like i am in a world of <UNK> -- not sure really where to go next .
this <UNK> will take time getting used to .
"i feel like the <UNK> that <UNK> and flows in the clouds -- <UNK> about , making light and then <UNK> ."
"over and over again , <UNK> , looking , and then touching ground ."
will i find peers that are satisfying and worth hanging around with ?
i think i just need to go out and explore the beauty that is around me and i will feel better .
"i wish my friend was here though with me , so that we could explore it together ."
"well , as they say , tomorrow is another day ."
this song by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> how i am feeling right now for that special someone who is on my mind ...
", it <UNK> to <UNK> thinking , it <UNK> to <UNK> , it <UNK> to the special people in my heart ."
i guess today i am really missing my friends .
especially some of them who know who they are .
"it would be nice to be able to see them , and give hugs and see smiles ."
it is <#> of those days where you wish they 'd invent a <UNK> device already so that it would send you instantly to the location of your choice .
i thought i would give some background of who i am and where i come from .
i guess i should start at the beginning -- but it seems so damn boring .
"i was born in illinois in <#> of the worst <UNK> 's in chicago 's history , january <#> ."
my mom almost did n't make it to the hospital .
i grew up on the north shore of chicago until i was <#> .
<UNK> were a big thing in <#> and my parents decided they wanted to be city <UNK> and get <#> in the south loop .
after a year of building we moved to downtown chicago .
"i was able to be who i wanted without being judged , i had chicago as my whole backyard and was really ready to explore who i was ."
"i had many experiences that i loved , hated and <UNK> i would never repeat again ."
i ended up moving to minnesota in <#> and realized i should have gone straight to california .
it is this side of myself that often gets me into the most trouble .
"it seems to feed on lack of control , <UNK> , and self - serving ."
there is always a time and place for everything .
"in december of <#> , we had the opportunity to move to california ."
my son was <#> months and we were to hit northern california at the beginning of the internet bubble .
"we did the internet thing , but never really considered ourselves "" <UNK> "" in fact we <UNK> that label ."
"we started our web building journey back in <#> , when yahoo was nothing but a place to list your homepage and <UNK> was still in beta ."
job opportunities took us south to orange county -- <UNK> where we spent <#> years .
"met some incredible people , some of whom i miss <UNK> , others not so much ."
"the weirdest thing is that i do n't "" miss """
"california , in fact i barely think about it ...."
"i want to meet people , and feel like i belong somehow ."
"but when you live among <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , the future is n't always certain but it can be judged by who did your <UNK> ."
i am going to tie up some loose ends and get some sleep .
"in the middle of the night , my <UNK> who normally is n't a mean person , turns to me and just got bloody angry ."
saying how <UNK> i am of how hard he works and how i do nothing but chat and play with people .
"well , gentle readers , i actually run my own company , <UNK> ( urllink <UNK> ) and i do my best to work hard every day ."
what <UNK> this was a <UNK> comment i had made .
he said that he works and works for me .
"in any case , <UNK> 's eye ( which apparently has <UNK> on it that we 're treating ) started to bug out at about <#> in the morning ."
whenever this man is sick or hurting he just <UNK> out .
oh did i mention that his parents moved <#> houses away on the same street ?
i think part of his <UNK> is coming from that .
but for <#> reason or another it is getting <UNK> by me .
i am not sure what i am doing to him that makes him so <UNK> of me all the time .
"i cook , clean and try to take care of him the best i can ."
his mom says i should get a blue <UNK> .
i do n't even cheat on him or do anything that is <UNK> .
i think he 's the <#> that needs <UNK> not me .
perhaps after he closes the project at work and does n't have to deal with the <UNK> <#> ( that is a separate entry all on its own ... )
"okay it is now the end of the day , and whatever was bothering <UNK> is gone now ."
i hate it when he gets all <UNK> out .
it is like having to walk on <UNK> which sucks the big <#> .
was an interesting day full of tears but also full of resolve .
"we even got to meet a neighbor tonight , who has the cutest , <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> ."
so what is a middle - aged ( well <#> ) married female doing writing a blog ?
"every night when everyone else is <UNK> , i seem to be the only <#> still awake at <#> am ."
some of which i can share here and some i dare not .
"well if i did , i might get into trouble ."
"rambling to no <#> , pouring my thoughts out for anyone to read ."
i seem to be able to focus on things and not drift off <UNK> somewhere ...
hard to believe having spent the last <#> years in california .
i miss california ... something so magical about it .
"actually west <UNK> <UNK> , where we live is n't really that bad ."
"in fact , we 're in a gorgeous house on a lake ."
not that i do n't mind my own company but would be nice to have friends .
i have n't had much time for exploring but that will come too .
was <#> but gained it back while we were moving .
"i feel like a <UNK> <UNK> . and to make matters worse , <UNK> keeps buying goodies .... <UNK> run away ..."
"<UNK> -- third hurricane of the season , <UNK> into florida ."
"figures , we move from california and florida gets the worst hurricane season in years ."
apparently this year has been predicted to have more active tropical <UNK> than previous years .
here is more information about <UNK> : the associated press updated : <UNK> p.m. et aug .
"<#> - <#> deaths were directly linked to andrew , which caused $ <#> <#> in damage ."
"our worst fears have come true , ” said <UNK> ."
"<UNK> bush , who <UNK> the <UNK> by <UNK> ."
"the category <#> storm was expected to cost florida “ at least several <#> dollars , ” said <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> for the insurance information institute ."
"ten deaths had been confirmed in charlotte county , said wayne <UNK> , the county ’s director of emergency management , but no exact death toll was available ."
"“ we believe there ’s significant loss of life , he said , adding later : “"
"i would hope that it would be limited to dozens , if that ."
” he said “ thousands upon thousands of people ” lost their homes .
"hundreds were <UNK> for in the county , which includes <UNK> <UNK> and port charlotte , the apparent hardest - hit areas ."
"extensive damage was also reported on exclusive <UNK> island , a narrow strip of sand west of fort <UNK> ."
<#> ca n't help feeling relief that our area was n't hard hit .
what can we do to help those in need ?
", the wind grew still ... and not a drop of rain came ."
we had walked down <#> houses to go to dinner at my in - laws .
"the night was a little <UNK> , but otherwise calm ."
you 'd never know that <#> hours due west utter destruction was happening .
it makes you remember how small you are and how huge this planet really is .
"i put the plants inside , <UNK> the patio furniture , and prayed a lot ."
i can only pray for those now who are homeless and suffering .
thinking we 'd have plenty of time to park and <UNK> walk in we left the house at <UNK> . wrong !
"omg between the crossing guards , hundreds of cars and the parking nazis he was almost late to school ."
good grief they make them get a lot of supplies .
so we walk to his class watching everyone in their little uniforms ( so cute ! )
i think tomorrow we 're walking or riding bikes .
but it 's hot out ! after walking <#> blocks
perhaps i could work that into my daily workout .
now there is an idea . but that <UNK> situation was horrible .
granted it was the first day of school but omg what a zoo .
"i hope that the day goes well , he remembers to bring home his <UNK> and backpack and starts to make friends ."
"in other news , i will start to be hair free ! ! ! !"
finally gonna get all that lovely extra facial hair taken care of .
"actually it is n't a laser , it is an <UNK> system ( <UNK> ) and wo n't hurt like the ruby laser i had <#> years ago ."
friday is my first appointment and i ca n't wait !
will take a few months but <UNK> worth it .
no feeling like a man ' cause i have to shave .
and as if on cue there is the thunder .
today was open house at <UNK> 's new school .
so we drove over to school to meet his teacher and get <UNK> with the school a bit .
"it is a really well - maintained school , with freshly painted <UNK> of the ocean and its creatures , like killer <UNK> , <UNK> and fish ."
i think that <UNK> will be in really good shape -- and he 's so excited !
davis -- a very nice middle - aged who appears to be hands - on teacher .
"i am going to volunteer in class again , this time for math ( sunshine math ) ."
i really enjoy <UNK> and getting to meet all the kids .
"turns out that <UNK> 's friend from karate , <UNK> , is there in his class !"
"lisa , her mom came walking in and i was like , "" hi ! """
and she smiled so widely as i think she was just as happy to see me .
<UNK> was thrilled that he has someone in both his karate and regular class that he knows now .
"<UNK> is a purple belt , so as long as she stays at the studio those guys could become pretty good friends !"
"so tomorrow is the big day -- school at last , school at last ! :)"
i have hurt a dear friend of mine very badly .
how can i get them to feel better about a decision that affects them so deeply ?
i do n't know what else to say to make them feel better .
"i know that this friend will eventually learn to let go of those hurt and angry feelings , but it is going to take some time ."
in the meantime how do i let them know i love them very much and only wish them the <UNK> happiness in their life ?
i keep telling her this over and over and over
"it <UNK> me that she ca n't "" hear "" me and will only dwell on the negative feelings in her heart ."
please hear me if you 're reading this and know i love you and only want the best for you .
"a couple of months ago , i posted the story on our <UNK> boards ."
"but in honor of our third anniversary , i’ve gone ahead and turned this into an article so that all members can read this at their own convenience ."
"way back in <#> , i got pregnant with my son <UNK> ( who is almost <#> ! ) ."
"back then as you can recall , the web was in its <UNK> ."
<UNK> existed as a beta version and yahoo was for posting your homepage .
"i was getting sick and tired of going through book after book , trying to get information about my pregnancy ."
"most of the books were dry and boring , using scare tactics and didn’t have any feel of peer <UNK> at all ."
"<#> sunday morning , minnesota , at the golden <UNK> restaurant in st ."
"paul , our friends and i were discussing this very dilemma ."
michael and ted came up with the idea to create a urllink pregnancy calendar that had a bit of information each day .
"thus , the <UNK> interactive pregnancy calendar was born ."
"this calendar that we created doesn’t exist at <UNK> anymore , but it does as a part of <UNK> ."
"they did that in <#> -- because well , the web was still pretty cool and new ."
we actually have our <#> minutes of fame on video .
we ended up being written up in magazines like yahoo !
"internet life , the wall street journal , various newspapers and <UNK> <UNK> ."
in the <UNK> and pregnancy space there were a couple of <UNK> being <UNK> and <UNK> .
"our friend <UNK> had her site as well as robin <UNK> , the creator of <UNK> ( she now heads up the pregnancy section at <UNK> ) ."
<UNK> wanted to mirror our pregnancy calendar and so we let them .
in <#> <UNK> was on an <UNK> <UNK> and ate up <UNK> .
<UNK> realized after that purchase that the calendar was n't theirs and asked to purchase our site to get full rights to it .
"so , <UNK> , in october of <#> , <UNK> purchased the calendar and it is still <#> of <UNK> 's top draws ."
"well , with that purchase , we moved to california in december of <#> ."
i stayed home with <UNK> and michael went to go work for a <UNK> .
this was just the beginning of the internet boom .
"we landed first in san jose , and then <UNK> , and later mill valley in the bay area ."
"when <UNK> was <#> months , <UNK> called michael ."
this was when <UNK> only had <#> <#> page views a month ( btw – we’re at <#> <#> ) .
i eventually became full - time and worked there for <#> years .
that is where i met some of you and my best friend julie <UNK> .
"fast forward to july <#> , we are in southern <UNK> left <UNK> after <UNK> <#> <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i was <UNK> and that was hard on me .
"i split that july ( it was very <UNK> still <UNK> we do n't exist ) and on september <#> , <#> , launched <UNK> ."
this is our third company and i think third time is the charm .
"so here i sit in beautiful <UNK> <UNK> , florida ."
we moved our family and company to the east coast in june .
"<UNK> is <UNK> and we have all kinds of exciting plans for the site , including <#> expansion sites that will help round out the experience ."
"for anyone that wants more information , you are always welcome to"
we went and saw the <UNK> candidate <UNK> today .
i thought it was an excellent <UNK> of a very <UNK> topic -- the <UNK> of politics for personal gain .
we 've seen nothing but this for the last <#> years under king george .
not only was this <UNK> appointed to the presidency by the supreme court but he 's ruined this country .
fascinating idea that some corporation would control the world including politicians .
well we 're really not all that far off with dick cheney and his <#> <#> dollar sec fine .
"for god 's sake , what is wrong with this country when we put away petty <UNK> <UNK> and yet the vice president gets away with anything ?"
it <UNK> me immensely because no <#> seems to give a rat 's ass .
not that a rat has much of an ass to give in the first place .
can this country survive another <#> years of bush ?
"no , i do n't think the world can <UNK> that ."
think about it . obviously in the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> .
the whole thing with bush and cheney <UNK> me .
i do n't see how folks ca n't see through it and what the situation really is .
"we have a man , who 'd rather party , who is a moron , running this country and its reputation into the ground ."
and no <#> is doing a damn thing about it .
"not the media , not our justice system , no <#> ."
hopefully if kerry gets in the first thing he 'll do is <UNK> a special <UNK> and let these fuckers burn .
i am buying a <UNK> <UNK> bike on saturday .
i will shock you by saying this is my new commute bike ( i do n't own a car ) .
"actually the felt is a better bike , but there is nowhere to change and shower at work , so i am getting a real easy ride for work ."
"i am <UNK> than box of rocks , but the <UNK> stuff is for the weekends for now . and"
this new bike will not have <UNK> <UNK> ( for now ) .
"<UNK> <UNK> kicks ass , and i saw the black keys at <UNK> and am seeing then again on the 9th of september ( at the <UNK> ! ) ."
"i fell over again today , and now i really know what pain is ."
my left knee has a big bruise and sends me pain messages whenever i get my butt up of the sofa .
"i do n't think that anything 's broken ( in my knee ) , but i hate <UNK> whenever i extend it ."
i must thank the driver that caused me to fall though .
that got my weight on the wrong side and i just went down hard .
"i was okay at work , but on the way home my knee kept hurting more and more , and now its painful ."
"luckily though i had the <UNK> on so not much skin was ripped off , but my knee does n't care now ."
"hope you were late to work and got fired and your car caught on fire on the way home , etc ."
so now my <UNK> on drivers vs. <UNK> . <#> . )
", if i ride in "" your lane "" please excuse me , a car door opening and catching me could , <UNK> , kill me . <#> . )"
"your car goes faster than my bike , so pass me when its safe ."
i have the same right to the road that you do .
"<#> . ) not all people who ride bikes are the same , i obey traffic laws , some people on "" bikes "" do n't ."
that is at there <UNK> to act like idiots .
"just remember that a geo and a big <UNK> equally bad problems if they hit us , and that most of us real <UNK> are very safety oriented ."
"we wear <UNK> , avoid busy streets and obey traffic laws ( i can get a ticket too ) ."
"if know of someone who rides without a helmet , please tell them to get <#> , or buy <#> for them , and make sure they wear it ."
"; i am done , i am sure my ' <UNK> ' will get better ."
it just sucks that my knee hurts because someone was a fucking dick .
"besides being the guy who knows mac hardware and software , he kicks ass on <UNK> stuff ."
"<UNK> offers no benefits ( unless you pay for it ) , and he has a mortgage to pay for ."
"i can do it , but not like him ."
"at least i think so , but today i screwed up ."
"nothing big , just i did n't fix a "" change and print "" negative ."
"i had been very good about that before , better than i used to be ."
so it was n't <UNK> being sam for about <#> minutes .
i am way to hard on myself and way to hard on others .
i know that and that is <#> of my ( many ) faults .
"i am a <UNK> , when it comes to work , too bad i do n't carry that <UNK> into the rest of my life ."
although if i did that i would n't have any friends and my family would have <UNK> my throat a long time ago .
"i am working with a pretty good team , especially the <UNK> 's that are new ."
"we have a good art department ( which i am proud to be <#> of ) , but its the little shit that drives me nuts ."
today i ran ad - aware on the internet pc at work and discovered that it had the ' <UNK> ' worm on it ... needless to say
"i cleaned it off and the <UNK> has improved greatly ( well , duh ! ) ."
"too bad were not running a <UNK> on anything connected to the net , it might cost us <#> bucks a <UNK> ..."
i should just ask for a raise for cleaning that shit up and tell the head <UNK> to get an it person .
i also <UNK> to <UNK> <#> and it seems to work better on my <UNK> box .
not a big fan of <UNK> but then again my xp pro box at home has serious issues with freezing in <UNK> that i ca n't figure out .
the games just stop and lock up the box .
i am updated on windows so maybe its just that i bought a <UNK> <UNK> video card .
"i have nt heard great stuff from people about "" pony ' "" stuff . or maybe the audio ( <UNK> ) is fucking it up ."
maybe i should buy more books about this ...
i have to give back danielle 's car this weekend .
so i will be on the bus again or just riding my new ( hopefully ) mountain bike to work .
"was <#> yesterday , and i think it ' <UNK> ' down to <#> today ."
"anyway , i have been looking at new stuff and today i just got $ <#> back from <UNK> ."
"so if i add that with the $ <#> i recieved before , that s <#> bucks to upgrade ( tires and tubes ) ."
i will insist on <UNK> and water bottles as free though .
if i drop a few on a bike the least they can do is make it complete .
"wow , all those words and really not much to say ."
"thank you for your patience , the <#> <UNK> <UNK>"
so its <UNK> am and i ca n't sleep .
"so i was up watching videos on launch , seeing some pretty good stuff by the <UNK> <UNK> , black keys , red hot chili peppers , white stripes ."
too bad m - tv is such a <UNK> of shows .
you used to just be able to sit and watch video after video there .
i do n't have a clue if they even play videos anymore .
"i am ' sans ' tv so i guess i miss a lot of stuff ,"
but actually it is nice not having the big idiot - box .
i have this little idiot box that gives me much more than any tv could .
why ca nt you just pick the stations you want and pay for those ?
wtf is up with that and why does n't the public say screw you cable ?
"i bought some new shoes for the bike , they are nice ."
pearl <UNK> 's ( i like pearl stuff ) and got to test them out last weekend .
but i really notice the difference between them and the <UNK> 's .
"<UNK> 's but right now i have better things to do with <#> bucks , like buy a mountain bike ( a giant ) ."
so i will have that to ride to work .
"i 'd ride the felt , but its a big hassle ( nowhere to change at work , etc . )"
"if i get <UNK> , i 'd rather give up a <#> dollar <UNK> than a <#> dollar <UNK> ."
"having danielle 's car has been nice , and i want to get <#> again ."
i just do n't know if i can afford <#> .
gas is stupidly expensive and insurance sucks big bull dork .
i 'll save up and hopefully by the end of the year i can get something .
"hi , i went to sf on sunday to see some bands play at the <UNK> ."
i had never been to the <UNK> and was most impressed by the number of great bands that have played there .
they have framed posters lining the walls of the shows .
"if you ever get the chance to see a show there , just looking at the posters and being in that place is worth the price of admission ."
"anyway , a friend from work and i went to see the show ."
"the line - up was the <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , and the <UNK> sound ."
"all swedish bands ( on the same label , i take it ) ."
my take on the night was that for $ <#> i got a great deal .
but that does n't mean that they are n't good .
"the next band was <UNK> <UNK> , who i saw at <UNK> music festival on may <#> , <#> ."
this is a <#> piece all girl band that looks great and sounds even better .
"to tell the truth , i bought the tickets for the show because i wanted to see them again ."
( i did n't even know who the <UNK> were ! )
"they just kicked maximum booty at <UNK> , and i was looking forward to another great performance ."
"well they did just that , and despite having a short set ( <#> minutes ! ! ! )"
"and i got to dancing with a really cute girl ( who i did not know ) that was right next to me , well kind of dancing ..."
"( is head banging , smiling , and looking at each other and shouting out the lyrics dancing ? )"
"then came the <UNK> ... stunned i was , for a bit and then started screaming !"
"<UNK> <UNK> with an iron mine , <UNK> <UNK> is the shit !"
and for good measure he went out into the crowd <#> times and they just lifted him back up <UNK> .
"great band all around , a drummer that kicks tail and a lead guitarist that is nothing less than a <UNK> ."
they just got the crowd going and never let up !
i was actually quite amazed and ca n't quite put into words what i really saw .
"<UNK> 's are nice but if sweden keeps producing bands like <UNK> and the <UNK> , we 'll be buying millions more cds than cars from them ."
"sam any good music is appreciated , let me know what you are listening to that s new , fresh and no <#> has heard of ."
"when the body was first created , all the parts wanted to be boss ."
"the brain said , "" i should be boss because i control all of the body 's responses and functions . """
"the feet said , "" we should be boss since we carry the brain about and get him where he wants to go . """
"the hands said , "" we should be the boss because we do all the work and earn all the money . """
all the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the boss .
"so , the asshole went on strike , blocked itself up , and refused to work ."
"eventually , they all decided that the asshole should be the boss , so the motion was passed ."
all the other parts did all the work while the boss just sat and passed out the shit !
moral of the story : you do n't need brains to be a boss -- any asshole will do .
"tommy <UNK> went into the <UNK> box and said , "" bless me father , for i have <UNK> ."
"i have been with a loose woman . """
"the priest said , "" is that you , little tommy <UNK> ? "" "" yes father , it is . """
""" who was this woman you were with ? """
""" i can not tell you , father , because i do n't want to ruin her reputation . """

your <UNK> will be <#> hail <UNK> and <#> our fathers .
"his friend , sean , slid over and whispered , "" what happened ? """

yesterday evening i was upstairs hanging out with my buddy <UNK> and i noticed my neighbor coming back from getting her mail .

"more recently , how about the <UNK> of aaron <UNK> , derek <UNK> , paul <UNK> , <UNK> and mo ?"
it 's such a shock to hear any <UNK> thinking that a new stadium is ok let alone to have the <UNK> front office actually move ahead .
"<UNK> , admitting he had an affair with a man ."
i 'm more curious as to why government officials always seem to quit their jobs when something controversial happens .
"they 're not actually heading off the controversy at the pass , so to speak ."
maybe someone can help <UNK> me as to how this story affects his job performance ?
i just ca n't see what the big deal is .
i would n't just quit my job because of something in my personal life .
maybe he did something during business hours and he does n't want it to be public ?
"he 's ' out ' anyway , so what more is there to be afraid of ?"
well if there was any doubt about orlando <UNK> it has to be gone now .
"granted , <#> - <#> is n't a world of wins , but the way he 's been pitching reminds me of <#> ."
we all know his record in the post season .
"even though they 've been ok in recent years , i still hate to see the boys go to texas ."
i guess it 's left over feelings from the johnny <UNK> years when they had such a hard time winning there during the regular season .
"( of course , post season play is a different matter . )"
"besides all that , i love to see them whip scott <UNK> ."
the only time i ever got to <UNK> stadium he was pitching for the <UNK> and beat the <UNK> <#> - <#> .
like these : i 'm still still not over the angels series . still not over game <#> against the <UNK> .
some day we 'll get the <UNK> required to help forget these <UNK> <UNK> .
"thoughts come rushing through your mind like , what <UNK> , get out of my way !"
finally you 're able see around the vehicles ahead .
a police officer is cruising along at the posted speed .
how dare he drive the speed limit and back up traffic like this !
this is the way this morning started for me .
"for most of us , our <UNK> schedule in the morning <UNK> on getting away with speeding ."
we do n't alter our schedule to allow for driving the posted speed .
"that would mean getting up earlier , being more motivated earlier , being concerned about the cost of a speeding ticket ."
i guess this extra time to think and ponder possible consequences could make us better citizens ?
i 've come to believe that being a lawyer is pretty much like being a terrorist .
everyone is so afraid of being <UNK> these days .
doctors are leaving the profession due to <UNK> insurance costs going so high which is due in part to <UNK> lawyers getting rich on others <UNK> .
teachers ca n't discipline students for fear of being taken to court .
there are many other examples of things such as these .
how about these class action suits we keep hearing about ?
"the so called <UNK> of the awarded money get meaningless amounts of change after the lawyers collect their fees , which usually amount to very large amounts of change ."
and the famous mcdonald 's coffee is too hot <UNK> .
( remember on <UNK> when they made fun of that <#> ? )
i wonder if i can sue now because i think the coffee is n't hot enough ?
overweight people are <UNK> <UNK> 's for making them fat .
do mcdonald 's workers really drag people in and force feed them ?
we have gun <UNK> being <UNK> for people using their products to hurt others .
cigarette <UNK> paying through the nose for people deciding to smoke .
"strangely , there has n't been any attacks on <UNK> <UNK> ( that i 've heard ) even though alcohol is the most abused drug there is ."
"the point is , people decide on their own what to do with the different products available ."
lawyers just help them to believe that the end result of that usage was someone else 's fault thereby giving them a chance to be rich .
the people have spoken and they say everything that happens is someone else 's fault .
"they say they ca n't be held responsible for things they do and , damn it , they 've got the <UNK> papers to prove it !"
"what 's worse is , the judges and/or <UNK> have been <UNK> with them !"
"soon we will be at a point where we need <UNK> for everything , just to feel safe about going out at night ."
"it was a pretty funny scene , but what if it would be real ?"
you may be able to sue someone soon for hurting your feelings just by not saying hello on the street .
that could be <UNK> as you creating an uncomfortable situation for someone else .
we have been taught that that is a big no no .
"scary thought , eh ? and being afraid is what terrorists want , is n't it ?"
"the yankees did n't get the sweep we were hoping for , thanks in part to <#> errors ."
looks like the <UNK> relief is in his future ? could be if <UNK> continues his streak .
"if we continue to win <#> out of <#> , this will be a pretty good year ."
their weakness ( pitching ) sure has been showing up lately .
not to mention the change in the <UNK> since ray miller was brought back .
"if the o 's keep rolling like this , hello <UNK> ."
i 'd love to have the yankees play them in the <UNK> .
"i 'm no o 's fan , to be sure ."
but there are some guys on their team i like .
"( roberts , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> . ) besides , i work within sight of <UNK> yards ."
the yankees knocking baltimore out of <UNK> would give me serious <UNK> rights .
they are young and good and will only get better .
"well , monday is here again in all it 's glory ."
"remember the <UNK> episode where jerry , <UNK> and <UNK> were in the car talking about the feel of different days of the week ?"
i bet every day seems like a weekend to them .
"there are lots of better things to do on a day like this , like a <UNK> , maybe ?"
i 've noticed that you do n't hear anybody naming their kids monday .
i 've heard of people named after days of the week .
i think someone on the adams family was named after a <UNK> .
"every time <UNK> walks into the room , everyone would be bummed out ."
"my friends and i followed a band years ago in which <#> of our closer friends were members , nv ."
"well , the friend i was wondering about happens to have her own website and has progressed in the music business to the point of recording her first cd ."
her name is urllink <UNK> <UNK> and she is a fantastic singer .
( click on her name to see her website . )
i do n't need to hear it to know that it will be worth having .
i ordered it via this website - urllink <UNK> - the link on her site is out of stock .
"if you like blues based music and great vocals , do n't hesitate to get this cd ."
my house is <UNK> and it 's over <#> degrees outside ... way to hot to work in the yard .
"... they are sending my resume out to a good co. , but entry level"
"the less i have to do all day , the less i actually get done ."
i have spent the last <#> hours checking out other people 's blogs ...
my son just got home from his first day at a real job ... working on our neighbor 's grandfather 's farm .
"i have been terrified that he would be a total lazy ass ... but i think most teenagers are total lazy asses , are n't they ?"
"he 's a great kid , he 's gonna be just fine ."
i would give anything to see him reach that dream .
i think i 'm gonna turn this thing off and find something constructive to do .

"i do n't take very many good pics , thank god for digital , but i love it ."
there is nothing like looking at a beautiful or intriguing photo .
"my hope is to some day make a living with photography , whether i 'm a photographer or just work with them on my computer ."
our new manager 's first move was to move our engineering department .
the reason given is that by moving the engineering department to the main floor of the shop from our second story group office was to improve communication .
the explanation was given that by being on the main floor of the shop we would <UNK> discussions and be more aware of what was happening .
break up the group by <UNK> everyone into different offices ( <#> guys per office ) and expect us to <UNK> in order to get our information .
"i suspect the real reason is that the new manager wants to keep his thumbs on us , which he ca n't do if we 're on another floor ."
so do we get to choose which office we want or who our office mates will be ?
the boss has already selected them for us .
real leadership does n't force change on the followers .
"a real leader would have prepared the <UNK> for the change ahead of time , not walked in and dropped a <UNK> ."
"a real leader <UNK> a <UNK> future and points out the benefits of the proposed change , thereby getting an emotional investment by the followers . as it goes here"
", most of the guys are pretty bummed out ."
"a nice big room to work in , with big windows and our own <UNK> ."
there 's a table in the middle of the room for snacks .
now we 'll be stuck <#> guys per office with no climate control .
- that 's <#> to <#> computer <UNK> and <#> to <#> <UNK> per office .
"it 's gonna be warm , so i hope my co - worker 's <UNK> lasts all day !"
"we discovered yesterday that our engineering manager is moving "" <UNK> "" ."
"so instead of an engineering manager , we get the general manager who has no professional <UNK> and has never <UNK> technical people before ."
just a small bit of background : i work in an office of a mold job shop .
"sometimes called a cope and a drag , other times called really technical names like "" upper half "" and "" lower half "" ."
"it is no small task to design these animals , and it is definitely the most difficult style of <UNK> that i have ever worked on ."
just a couple of <UNK> and several other guys who generate the nc programs which are run on our machines which cut the mold pieces .
my husband does n't approve of all the blog reading i do .
"he is concerned that i might be "" in search "" of something ."
he sometimes has these moments of blind and pointless fear that i am going to leave him .
( and here i could tell you the whole reason why -- which has nothing to do with me -- and
everything to do with his own mixed up childhood -- but i 'm not because it 's his story . )
i am not looking for anything like that .
"but i certainly have to keep my blog a secret from him , because he would see this as an admission of a desire to be found ."
"i totally believe that most bloggers ( and here , even as a <UNK> i am including myself ) share too much information ."
"the people that know me well , would read this and know immediately who i am -- either through my style , or my description of life events ."
even today i feel compelled to wind out a story that is considered by myself and my husband to be <UNK> that we keep secret from the world .
"we do not discuss it with others , we do no tell ."
"are these secrets , <UNK> subjects , sharing of <UNK> and intimate <UNK> an attempt at honesty and connection ?"
i mean i have a <UNK> i tell more to than i should -- <UNK> that pushing the envelope enough ?
"why do i feel compelled to tell total strangers , the internet , anyone with a <UNK> secret stuff ?"
and certainly it ca n't be because we desire the advice and support of strangers .
are n't we asking for it just in the act of telling ?
it took me <#> years -- after i 'd discovered blogging to start a site .
why do i think anyone cares what i have to say ?
( evidently they do n't as no <#> is reading yet -- again with the hope ) .
i 'd become a buffy fan after having my first child .
( to those that are confused -- the <#> year old is my <UNK> .
the <#> year old is the first baby of my marriage . )
i started reading episode descriptions and posting on various boards about episodes .
from there it was a quick click to urllink <UNK> -- the owner of the <UNK> <UNK> .
his life completely different from a middle aged stay at home mom .
he had links on his site and i found urllink <UNK> .
"i <UNK> , occasionally posted and felt like a fool ."
when she got engaged i cried tears of joy for her -- and for my own memory of my engagement .
from there i fell down a rabbit hole on her links .
i found a whole bunch of people in her circle interesting .
my husband can always tell when i have an ear turned towards the table next to us .
i even found through this rabbit hole a girl i went to highschool with urllink <UNK> .
i even posted and she sent me her email to catch up with her .
i replied but got her email address wrong and so sent an extremely <UNK> and <UNK> full of info email to a complete stranger .
i never tried to <UNK> it -- sorry tina !
tina is a big <UNK> to the world of blogging for me .
after i cycle through a few of julie 's and her mutual friends i hit some of tina 's links .
in fact my husband and i are <UNK> <UNK> .
"he would be upset if i told you that he has never had the joy of having to "" work "" to get someone pregnant ."
"however , i read get up <UNK> and weep with her as she travels on the roller coaster of trying to have kids ."
she <UNK> at her situation and all the <UNK> people in the world and i <UNK> with her .
i think about posting on her site and stop myself because <UNK> god the woman has like <#> comments after every post .
does she really need me to tell her right on !
and i do n't want to say the wrong thing .
and none of you really know me .
"then <#> day , <UNK> posted about urllink <UNK> ."
and it 's <#> more voice that i must check in on with <UNK> .
<UNK> is also a well read site -- and for good reason .
i have found more than a half dozen other sites that i like to look at when i 've got nothing better to do .
and honestly i do n't have the time to do this --
"is it that this is better than laundry , cooking or a <#> other necessary tasks that i 'm <UNK> ? )"
do i want <#> comments and help naming my daughter 's <UNK> ?
i think maybe it 's all of these <UNK> and maybe <#> or the other of them more than others on certain days .
"margaret <UNK> 's <UNK> ( is that even a word ? ) to her <UNK> have only to connect "" <UNK> the great howard 's end by <UNK> ?"
( i really do n't know . ) where we all finally feel we can have a voice -- even if we ca n't <UNK> a president .
( and i better stop soon before i stop asking questions and start ranting . )
so i ask these questions of myself and of you .
what am i doing here that i ca n't do in a diary ?
and why do i feel compelled to do it ?
"and so you know , my husband is a good man ."
he just has a different comfort level with this than i do .
and i feel guilty for doing this behind his back .
"<UNK> empty <UNK> , sorry i 've been away so long ."
the roller coaster soap opera that is my husband 's employment is still in a state of <UNK> .
he has nowhere to go on monday but the couch .
i 'll be in the corner slowly going out of my mind .
i hope he was n't looking for me to disagree because all i did was giggle my <UNK> off .
my <UNK> says she 's expecting my call .
"meanwhile , we were hoping for a call today from the company that 's been <UNK> him for the last year ."
the company was having a meeting to discuss what they wanted to do at this point .
still the meeting was in california where right now it 's still early -- applies <UNK> <UNK> .
my <UNK> is out with the guys playing poker -- and calling every hour to see if he 's called -- cue the stalker chorus !
i 've been thinking about writing a children 's book .
a friend of mine in houston told me she just <UNK> me writing a children 's book about rabbits .
"stray thoughts have been chasing their way through my head -- like a sleeping dog , chasing rabbits ."
both of my girls just crawled into my lap and demanded a story .
"i asked them if they wanted <#> about <UNK> , "" cried the <#> - year - old with <UNK> ."
"when you 're a <UNK> in <UNK> , no <#> can hear you scream ."
"no <#> 's reading ( yet , she says hopefully ) so i guess it 's ok for me to <UNK> a bit . ."
i had a big fight with the husband last night .
we both <UNK> stupidly -- we woke up still grumpy and unhappy .
he went to work where the writing on the wall seemed to be <UNK> down at him .
they wo n't be needing his services much longer .
so we 've had to put the fight behind us and try to face the coming weeks together .
which is on the <#> hand a good thing when your grown up lives force you to be --
"on the other hand , i was n't quite finished being angry ."
"i had n't won my point , proved my case , <UNK> the opposition ."
"you know the song : girl do n't go away mad , just go away ."
"that will be sad , because i really do love my husband ."
he 's a good man and about as perfect as i am -- so we 're well suited .
you decide whether i 'm <UNK> us or not .
"i hurt for him , i 'm scared for our family ."
i went by the library where i used to work -- because right now i ca n't afford books -- and it made me sick inside .
i 'm just looking for a little kindness here !
thanks to sonic for their mood - lifting vanilla <UNK> .
"it 's the small things in a small life like mine , you know ?"
"as if the previous post were n't enough , the damn baby ( love her ! )"
"has taken her favorite toy , which just happen to also be my keys to the car , house , and mailbox and lost ."
"oh yeah , because i knew the crying and <UNK> that would follow and i had a <UNK> ."
"ok , but where are the keys , baby ?"
the other kids want to go to the swimming pool .
"help , i 'm being held <UNK> by a <#> month old , she 's <UNK> my key <UNK> !"
they keep telling him how much they want him -- they wine him and <UNK> him .
they invite him to play poker and tell him every once and a while what they will pay him when they can hire him .
it 's all been like an endless and wonderful first date .
"a few months ago , we decided this job was a done deal ."
that the time before it would happen was limited -- we felt the <UNK> writing was on the wall !
so i quit my job ( where i was unhappy and growing an <UNK> ) to be home with the kids .
we had some savings to get by on and i would start my own business from home -- which is going well if not super <UNK> .
and then we were told that really the letter was <UNK> and we were just awaiting a rubber stamp . that the rubber stamp would happen this past monday .
we felt that truly the righteous were about to be rewarded !
"we had made a good decision for our children , giving them their mother at home !"
we had made a good decision by continuing to chase this <UNK> but <UNK> job .
we were good people who deserved good things .
we were thinking of how that basket would <#> day be joined by another much <UNK> basket and maybe a pot in which to piss !
( i did however finally get a dessert from <#> of the fancy pants places they take him too -- <UNK> <UNK> .
we are <#> months in to my not working and the savings have <UNK> .
we have a <UNK> return on my business that we will use to make it to his next paycheck .
at my house we are currently <UNK> the body <UNK> necessary for kicking oneself .
i have spent a lot of time reading other 's blogs .
i do n't know which <#> i want to be more .
but something has been calling out to me from the blogs of others .
perhaps this blog will help me to get a fire going -- what the hell am i saying ?
"i 'm a mom i have so many fires and so many <UNK> in them -- crap , i do n't have time for a blog ."
so here we go - my journey begins today through andy stanley 's book <UNK> !
i came across the following on a website yesterday .
i have sought permission to use it from the author and should he refuse then i will remove it from the blog
how big is your <UNK> is there an <UNK> between the <#> ?
a dream so large that he could n't contain it .
a dream so huge that his brothers could n't <UNK> it .
god asked him what he would like god to give him .
god gave him wisdom the like of which had never been or has been seen .
the results of that dream changed the world .
is it so large that you can never see it being completed ?
is it so vast that the world could not comprehend it ?
is it so great that the lord himself can only <UNK> it ?
my question is this : if god can do <UNK> why not dream big ?
"if we 're <UNK> on god to bring our dreams to pass , we might as well dream big ."
"if god can complete big visions as well as small visions , why not go for the big <#> ?"
"close your eyes , open your heart , see what god is wanting to do ."
"dream big , be bold , take hold of all that god wants for your life ."
"written by victor <UNK> urllink <UNK> tomorrow i begin reading and commenting on the book "" <UNK> "" let the journey begin !"
"the final vision killer i want to highlight from george <UNK> 's book "" the power of vision "" is short term thinking ."
"he writes : today , leaders are increasingly interested in <UNK> in resources for short - term benefits ."
the tragedy is that it leaves nothing in place for the long run .
to follow such a course <UNK> us of a satisfying future by chasing immediate <UNK> .
we <UNK> the past to enjoy the present at the expense of the future .
"the truth is , , however , that god ’s vision for ministry is long term in nature ."
"his knowledge and resources are unlimited , <UNK> us to pursue a vision for which he will be responsible to the end ."
he has created a season for each good thing and knows the appropriate pace for life .
we should pursue the vision in concert with his timing .
his vision may lead you to such <UNK> activities .
"define your measures of success in ministry such that you respond to his timing , not that of the world ."
"summary of the whole in the end , you are the only person who can limit your ability to dream big with god . as a leader"
", you have a responsibility to recognize and overcome the <UNK> of god ’s vision ."
"if you are truly committed to <UNK> his vision for your ministry , see the <UNK> for what they are : danger <UNK> to be avoided ."
they are not obstacles that should remove you from the action on the spiritual playing field .
"so you can see the entire town , and beyond , as you pray !"
... that 's why i think i am good at it !
"i tend to dream big , pray about it and then talk about it , to <UNK> people , and see what <UNK> ."
some dreams <UNK> out quickly whilst others gather momentum as others catch the dream .
"they , like a seed , however , can take time to grow ."
over the years i have come to <UNK> that some people dream and others develop the dream .
"whilst god is always central to the <UNK> of a dream , he also gifts people with certain skills through which he can work ."
"a dreamer needs a team around them who have the mind and the skills to help put the dreams into some realistic , <UNK> format ."
they are a great encouragement to a dreamer as long as they first catch the dream !
"<#> more day to go before i begin going through the book "" <UNK> "" by andy stanley ."
"having <UNK> tradition , fear and <UNK> as potential vision killers george <UNK> adds a further <#> - that of fatigue - to his list ."
even the greatest spiritual warriors need times of rest .
"if you have difficulty <UNK> excitement about the vision or if you have trouble <UNK> the vision , check to see if you are running on empty ."
vision calls for a tremendous degree of faith and energy .
seeking vision when you are exhausted makes no sense .
your natural <UNK> will be to resist those <UNK> that call for you to break down known <UNK> and to <UNK> the known .
fatigue will limit your vision and your influence for him .
"prepare for the challenge by <UNK> your mental , emotional and spiritual batteries ."
"when you are <UNK> for the challenge , move forward ."
urllink building the team <UNK> ( so far ) ( click to <UNK> )
"in addition to tradition and fear , george <UNK> adds <UNK> to his list of vision killers ."
he writes : sometimes we fail to behave with <UNK> and passion because we are ignorant or <UNK> .
"this statement is a prescription for half - baked , half - blessed ministry ."
"if he didn’t care , he would not have given dreams and words to the <UNK> ."
"in fact , he would not have provided <UNK> ."
"if he didn’t care , he would not ask us to seek his guidance and ask for his blessing ."
"if he didn’t care , he would not have allowed certain passages of the bible to become part of the <UNK> ."
"<UNK> - <#> , luke <UNK> - <#> , <UNK> ."
god ’s passion for mankind is evident in the story of jesus christ .
the passion of <UNK> leaders like paul and david is evident in their works .
"once the passion has been <UNK> , we are of little value in the raging fight between the powers of light and darkness ."
"those who reflect <UNK> and ignorance will be the next casualties on the spiritual battlefield . as you evaluate your quest for his vision ,"
are you ready to give it all you’ve got ?
would you die for the chance to see that vision become reality ?
do you care enough about your relationship with him and for the <UNK> of the vision he gives you to put everything you have on the line ?
is your church so <UNK> that the prospects of fulfilling the vision are slim ?
"if you are serious about serving him to the fullest , identify those people whose hearts are <UNK> and avoid letting them <UNK> the process ."
in november <#> i took <#> weeks out to seek god for vision for the church .
"i had attended a conference with bill <UNK> the week before entitled "" it takes a team "" ."
"as far as i was concerned that conference was "" simply "" a <UNK> for my time out and yet it proved to be a major <UNK> ."
( when god is in charge there are always surprises ! ) .
"on the first day of "" seeking "" i arranged my books , papers and laptop on the table and began to wait on god ."
"within a short time i <UNK> the lord say "" build the team "" ."
"but god simply said "" build the team "" ."
"the more i read and prayed the stronger was the impression to "" build "" ."
i began to see how the church was efficient in so many areas and yet they were all functioning independent of each other .
"we were a <UNK> church and like a computer we needed to be "" <UNK> "" to remove the <UNK> so that everything and everyone would function closer together ."
"jesus said in luke <UNK> "" whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much """
"<UNK> is his book "" the power of vision "" suggests that like tradition , fear can be a vision killer ."
he writes : <UNK> and <UNK> god ’s vision can be a frightening prospect .
moving in new directions or attempting new methods of ministry is <UNK> .
"risk raises the possibility of failure , and none of us want to fail , especially in ministry ."
sometimes we are overcome by fear because we have failed in the past and dare not reach for the stars again .
"by focusing on our <UNK> , we miss out on our potential ."
we also experience fear in situations that we can not control completely .
we often lack faith the size of a mustard seed .
"in its place , we <UNK> our authority over our destiny ."
"consequently , we are <UNK> by fear , limited in our ability to <UNK> new <UNK> for god ’s glory ."
it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it with peace and <UNK> .
"vision raises questions , but it does not raise nagging doubts ."
believe that he can do what he desires to do .
i remember the time i was involved in selling <UNK> bible college in <UNK> .
many of my congregation had attended the college as students or been staff members and therefore you can imagine it was a tough time for me and the church .
i would love for you to post comments on anything which you have read in my blog .
you will then be asked for a username and password and an option to remember you .
click that enter your name into username ( this can be your name or a web name - <UNK> mine is <UNK> )
"for the next few days however i am studying another interesting book on vision called "" the power of vision ” by george <UNK> ."
"in it the writer <UNK> some areas that can be "" vision killers "" unless they are handled correctly ."
today i have been thinking about the area of tradition .
this usually is expressed through such <UNK> as “ but
"” in reality , god uses traditions in ministry to provide people with a <UNK> of <UNK> and stability ."
traditions can form a foundation upon which he builds the future .
"traditions can serve as a bridge between the past and the future , <UNK> people to retain a comfort zone while focusing on him ."
but god has no use for traditions that block progress .
"he <UNK> those traditions that build the church and his people , not because they are traditions but because they serve his purposes ."
"indeed , he tends to <UNK> traditions by moving them in new directions ."
he updates them with a more relevant and contemporary expression of those truths that made the tradition valuable initially .
but his primary concern is not with the style or format of the tradition ; his interest is in its ability to draw people closer to him .
is there any room for a marriage between the <#> ?
"absolutely ! because he is the god who created and <UNK> over the past , he can use history to his advantage in your life and ministry ."
he has no reason to <UNK> out all memory of the past or to deny its value and power .
"instead , it is likely that he will continue to move you in a ministry direction that helps you mature ."
maturity means growing beyond your past and <UNK> what and where you have been .
he will use your past to <UNK> your future .
"in your ministry , acknowledge your past for what it has been ."
recognize the traditions and patterns that <UNK> you to impact people ’s lives for his glory .
"use those as stepping - stones , building your ministry for maximum impact ."
"determine how you can honor your past by <UNK> past <UNK> into your future . """
"i had been brought up in a christian home , a rebel yes , but not really that bad !"
shame on you <UNK> ! coming to know jesus is what is important - not how !
i no longer <UNK> that past - i am now grateful for it and seek to provide a <UNK> environment for my children -
"i desire that my children would follow jesus but i also desire that they will not have to first give up a life of drink , drugs and crime ."
if i can do something to help them not to want to choose that way of life then i will pursue that cause .
"the account was n't there but another piece of paper did catch my eye - it was headed "" <#> ways to identify the voice of god "" ."
i thought i might use it soon in <#> of my blogs so brought it back upstairs and put it with my papers .
today i was talking to someone from church who is in an important stage in his life that requires a big step of faith .
i love it when a plan comes together ! !
<#> . god 's voice will never tell us to engage in any activity or relationship that is <UNK> with the holy <UNK> .
"since god never tells us to do anything to <UNK> his word , the better we know it , the more readily we will identify his speaking voice <#> ."
"although there are exceptions , usually when god requires something of you it will clash with what you <UNK> to be the natural , reasonable course of action ."
this is not to say that god does n't <UNK> human wisdom .
but on many occasions god 's voice will ask us to accomplish something that seems quite <UNK> to our rational mind <#> .
god will never tell us to do anything that <UNK> the flesh .
if what we hear <UNK> us to forget what everyone else says and just do as we please then we should know that it is n't of god <#> .
god is always challenging our faith and in doing so he builds our relationship with him and helps us grow into <UNK> with him <#> .
"when god speaks , <UNK> his voice will call for an act of courage on our part ."
"when god speaks , the <UNK> of his plans <UNK> to some degree on whether we respond with confident , <UNK> spirits ."
his voice leads us not into <UNK> <UNK> but into bold witness <#> .
god is concerned about the influences and witness we as believers have on other people .
if there is a <UNK> or <UNK> toward others in what we hear then it is not of god .
satan always <UNK> us to act immediately because he knows if we back off and think long enough we 'll <UNK> <#> .
god is interested and concerned for the consequence of our actions .
"he <UNK> us to "" eat drink and be merry "" but fails to add "" for tomorrow you are going to die and face judgement """
"god <UNK> us that he has <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> us to become <UNK> to the image of christ ."
that being so then whatever god speaks will <UNK> our spiritual growth .
that means that god will never tell us to do anything or think of anything that sets us back spiritually .
when god speaks <#> of the most <UNK> signs is a sense of <UNK> in the spirit .
i took the day off today and went to <UNK> <UNK> park in <UNK> .
"the "" highlight "" of the drive for me was the <UNK> section !"
"<#> or so monkeys set their minds on "" higher things "" - namely the car roof ! as they did"
i noticed <#> different responses which i applied to <UNK> * :
<#> . a baby monkey was trying to climb up on the <UNK> of a car but was unable .
he kept jumping and sliding down as he did not have enough power to leap or <UNK> to stick .
sometimes a <UNK> can struggle to grasp hold of what they feel god has shared with them .
they need to look to god to be <UNK> and <UNK> to keep going .
""" it is not by might , nor by power but by my spirit says the lord "" ( <UNK> <UNK> ) <#> ."
"so often a <UNK> can be distracted from what god has said by following the well meaning , well <UNK> desires of others ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> are valuable , but keeping to what god has said is essential ."
i wondered if their true intention was to sit on the roof but they had settled for a mid - way point .
it is easy to see some of a vision fulfilled and settle for that and then move away .
a vision should be seen through to its completion ( <UNK> <#> <UNK> <UNK> )
<#> . some monkeys achieved their goal - they were on top of the car !
"they had seen the vision whilst on the ground , <UNK> the vision and were now sitting in the place of <UNK> ."
a <UNK> needs to believe the vision can be fulfilled and continue <UNK> towards it until it is .
""" i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me . """
( <UNK> <UNK> ) * i wish to make it clear that i am not <UNK> that <UNK> are monkeys ! ! .
this evening was really inspiring ! a sharing of a vision !
the vision is to believe it will be accomplished within <#> ! !
it 's god 's way of sharing his vision for us !
"it made me think of the "" god moment 's "" in my life and <#> time in particular <UNK> to mind . back in <#>"
i was training to be a school teacher - my future was sorted !
i had joined a church in <UNK> and had soon got involved as a youth worker ( with <UNK> ) and then later also became a <UNK> .
"i also did a bit of "" lay preaching "" ."
"at the close a senior member of the congregation said to me "" i am going to ask the elders to invite you to become our minister "" ."
you see i did not want to be a minister !
so i had some idea of what would be involved and the strain it can place on home life and personal health .
"i had rejected <UNK> when i left bible college because a minister 's life was not for me - serving god somewhere , yes ...."
no thank you ! by the time i got home - i had dealt with my initial <UNK> and
told <UNK> what i felt the lord had said ( and what the elderly gentleman had said ) .
at that point we both prayed and submitted ourselves to whatever god 's will was for our future - then got on with life .
i never heard anything from the elderly man nor his church - i was relieved !
"during the next few months , however , our church went through somewhat of a change as the minister announced that he was leaving . as a <UNK>"
<#> day the minister asked to see me and dropped a <UNK> .
he asked me to go and pray about whether i felt it was of god and if so to allow my name to go forward .
this was shared with the <UNK> and they suggested that i should finish my training as a teacher first and then review it .
in the meantime we continued to look for a minister and the church were not told about me !
i did not feel experienced enough or mature enough to do this thing .
i was struggling with the idea that this was really god 's plan for me but needed regular <UNK> !
on <#> sunday evening - i will never forget it - i was upstairs on car watch duty and a visiting speaker was bringing the word .
i do not remember all that she said but <#> phrase she used stood out and became a source of great encouragement !
i have been looking at this verse in different versions and notice a great <UNK> - not of meaning but of the <UNK> of the meaning .
look at the following versions which i have presented in order of <UNK> !
contemporary english version his power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine .
new life version god is able to do much more than we ask or think through his power working in us .
may we see his shining - greatness in the church .
sometimes the task up ahead seems too demanding maybe even impossible - but if god is behind it then the outcome ( and the process ) may be amazing !
after about <#> minutes he had bought most of the property and had houses on <#> sets .
i had very little hope of winning and was preparing for defeat .
"i then landed , and bought , park lane and <UNK> ."
this led to buying <#> then <#> then <#> houses for each and
i welcomed the arrival of luke 's playing piece on my property on a couple of occasions .
"having acquired more money i was able to afford hotels which then luke conveniently landed on ! by the time <#> hour had gone by , luke quit !"
"as someone once said when you see the word "" impossible "" think "" him - possible ! """
no matter how impossible the vision appears - if god said it - it 's guaranteed !
i have <UNK> <UNK> on the first promise that god gave me concerning being a <UNK> .
in early <#> as i prepared to become the minister of <UNK> <UNK> church in <UNK> - my first <UNK> - god led me to <UNK> <UNK> - <#> .
i am the lord ; that is my name !
i will not give my glory to another or my praise to <UNK> .
"see , the former things have taken place , and new things i declare ; before they spring into being i announce them to you . """
you know what the worst thing about friday is ?
the urllink <UNK> blog has <UNK> fridays .
"since i do n't have any <UNK> - yet , i ca n't sit back and wait for people to contribute ."
"i thought fridays would be a good day to write nice , happy thoughts ."
"i do n't want to leave anyone with the impression that i 'm an angry , bitter person ."
i 'd like to use my happy friday post to talk about people i admire : bill <UNK> favorite president .
"the republicans really missed a great opportunity with clinton , a true moderate ."
"but then , he got the country going in the right direction without their help ."
if he had only been more liberal ... <UNK> <UNK> future is now .
his speech at the democratic convention was ... <UNK> .
will it be fair to john edwards in <#> years to have to go up against a <UNK> ticket ?
"<UNK> for <#> , <UNK> for <#> , <UNK> ?"
for another <UNK> going to be an old man by the time this is done .

"no , that s no being bitter or angry , it 's being hopeful ."
"democrats are talking about a <UNK> ( <UNK> , house , and senate ) ."
"ok , maybe it does n't happen , but before democrats stopped being a bunch of <UNK> , that was n't even worth thinking about ."
"michael <UNK> not always sure of the details , but the message is right on target ."
there are <UNK> conservatives and then there are social <UNK> .
ultra - conservatives tend to <UNK> towards social issues .
they <UNK> think back to a golden age when women and <UNK> knew their places .
remember trent <UNK> 's urllink praise of <UNK> <UNK> ?
how about bob <UNK> 's idea of the urllink real america
"? here 's a clue , if the person speaks <UNK> about "" states rights , "" they oppose civil rights ."
"and then there 's the whole national sales tax thing , <UNK> the separation between church and state ( or whatever ) ."
well you can urllink read it for yourselves .
"which <UNK> ( really , which <UNK> of a <UNK> ) is alan <UNK> hoping to draw from in illinois ?"
"i 'm sorry , it just does n't exist in any numbers ."
alan <UNK> could not win even if katherine harris were responsible for counting the votes .
where is the money coming from for this race ?
the <UNK> is not throwing money away this year .
alan <UNK> believes that <UNK> obama is out of touch with the people of illinois .
"<UNK> opposed hilary clinton 's run for the senate , because she was not from new york ."
"somehow , i guess , this is completely different ."
the last time i was in missouri i was <UNK> by a security guard at the holiday inn in lake of the <UNK> with a <UNK> for racial <UNK> .

now missouri gives us their version of a urllink constitutional ban on gay marriage .
<UNK> - some percent of missouri voters approved the amendment .
"missouri , if you 're going to take a big dump on your constitution , why have <#> ?"

"i do n't think discrimination should be written into our country 's constitution , our state 's constitution , or our city 's <UNK> ."
"discrimination should be left in the <UNK> of small minded people getting together for a beer , at the local <UNK> that displays the <UNK> flag ."
"marriage is a religious function , pure and simple ."
"to the government , every marriage is a civil union ."
"let the government collect their tax revenue from unions , and let the churches do as they please ."
"if a church does n't want to marry a "" non - traditional "" couple , i think they have every right to refuse under the first amendment ."
"however , if a church gives it 's blessing , more power to them ."
"in short , marriage is not a federal , state , or local decision , it 's a personal decision between <#> people in love ."
did n't he only <UNK> <#> or <#> measure ( of no real value ) that actually passed ?
the <UNK> do n't really care about what they say ( or do ) .
they rely on the american public to forget about it .
exactly how many bodies did they find in mass <UNK> in iraq ?
"and , how many were there because bush <#> did n't follow up on his promise to back a <UNK> ?"
did they ever apologize about making up the story about how the clinton administration trashed everything before they left ?
"how about <UNK> the <UNK> air quality report for new york following <#> , or any other scientific finding at odds with the official administration line ?"
what did bush do while he was <UNK> ?
i 'll come up with some more later with links .
let me go on record as saying that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <#> of the greatest events in cubs history .
"we are truly blessed to be <UNK> <#> future hall of <UNK> on the field for the cubs ( <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ) ."

go to michelle <UNK> 's urllink website and it should n't take any time to figure that there is something seriously wrong with michelle <UNK> .
i 'm not saying that all asian americans should have the same belief structure .
"i am saying that there is no defense for <UNK> or racial <UNK> , especially coming from an asian american ."
"michelle , if you hate who you are so much , i recommend <UNK> surgery ."
they should be able to point you in the right direction .
"i can just imagine it , little michelle <UNK> would have ridden her <UNK> up to the gates of <UNK> to turn herself in ."
"look at the <UNK> over there , you 've got other women and children ."
"if anyone has a clue as what is wrong with michelle <UNK> , i 'd love to hear comments ."
"for lack of a better title , i decided on dis dat and da utter ting ."
so what is it that i feel the desperate need to share with everyone else ?
i 'd rather think that i love my country enough to hope that we can pull out of the <UNK> spiral that is the bush legacy .
i 'm not sure what the republican 's fascination with <UNK> morons is .
bush <#> was generous enough to give a bunch of them jobs .
"the thing is , if you ask a right <UNK> about iran <UNK> , it pretty much never happened in their minds ."
"keep in mind that reagan and bush funded and armed <UNK> "" <UNK> "" , saddam hussein , and osama bin laden ."
"oh , i forgot to mention their pet south american death <UNK> project ."
"they sure knew how to pick 'em , did n't they ? back to my point . ."
actually i already described him as a <UNK> moron .
"is he a liar , a <UNK> liar , or too stupid to know the <UNK> ?"
"a liar , a <UNK> liar , or too stupid to know the difference ."
"so , to be a <UNK> , <#> must sell out their country ."
bush and <UNK> will make a <UNK> of money off of afghanistan and iraq .
was this the primary reason for going to war ?
according to the urllink illinois leader ( illinois ' conservative news source ) it 's democrat <UNK> obama .
alan <UNK> says he 'd like to go back to the appointment of u.s .
he feels that the <#> change <UNK> the <UNK> of state governments in federal representation .
"if we look at the <UNK> pace of house <UNK> and compare that to the <UNK> course of the senate , you can see a wide contrast ."
"the house members represent a match smaller , and usually more <UNK> <UNK> ."
no <#> would argue that the house is much more partisan than the senate .
"if state <UNK> appointed their senator , this appointment would be made , in effect , by the ruling state political party . and"
"following this line of thought , the senator would be even less representative of the state 's <UNK> and even more a mouth - piece for national politics ."
"yes , it 's easier to <UNK> <UNK> than alan <UNK> ."
"but , does he have to make it so easy ?"
just a urllink link to a funny post on daily <UNK> .
"including myself , my <UNK> may be up to <#> ."
"i 'm not claiming regular <UNK> , just someone may have stumbled across my blog ."
"in other words , my <UNK> has exploded <#> % ."
"i am truly <UNK> by the <UNK> of this responsibility , and burden ."
here 's a reminder of why this election is so important .
"apparently , the urllink <UNK> have discussed the position of chief justice of the supreme court with <UNK> thomas ."
alan <UNK> urllink burst into song for cbs <#> chicago .
<UNK> evidently studied music at some new england <UNK> and considered a career in music ( opera ) .
"after hearing him sing "" somewhere over the <UNK> , "" i 'm not sure what to say ."
"richard <UNK> , r - alabama has <UNK> the services of a lawyer to defend himself against ethics charges on urllink <UNK> <UNK> terrorist conversations ."
bad news is that the justice department does n't take national security too seriously .
referring the charges to the ethics panel means that charges will most likely not be <UNK> against <UNK> .
i 'm glad <UNK> <UNK> does not work in criminal investigation .
"on a completely different note , senator kerry please stop talking about your vote <UNK> the use of force in iraq ."
"i 've been too busy to post today , so let 's try something different ."
"george bush 's idea of "" compassionate <UNK> "" is neither compassionate nor conservative ."
"sure it 's been done before , i 'm just really busy ."
"in keeping with the partisan tone of his administration , w chooses urllink <UNK> <UNK> to head the cia ."
w will inevitably <UNK> any <UNK> to <UNK> ' nomination as <UNK> national security .
<UNK> broken and rejected those principles he has taken the <UNK> 's position .
"i have no idea what <UNK> is saying , but i 'm not sure he does either ."
it would be a waste of time for obama to spend time defending himself against this <UNK> .
"the illinois gop is already <UNK> its decision , i 'm sure ."
judge begins urllink contempt of court <UNK> against journalists covering for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .

"then again , the press should n't aid and <UNK> criminals ."
<UNK> urllink blows terrorist double - agent cover .
"it 's not new news , but at least it 'll make it official ."
i wish people would pay attention to this stuff .
keep in mind that the cia had different instructions than the military .
"bush urllink <UNK> , and urllink again ."
he 's lived up to the nation 's low expectations .
way to go <UNK> % of american 's that actually voted for this moron .
"urllink arrest <UNK> issued for <UNK> <UNK> and nephew , <UNK> ."

"<UNK> <UNK> is , of course , the man who urllink <UNK> <UNK> witnesses to w in his case for war ."
"it turns out the "" intelligence "" was <UNK> , but w and friends already new that ."
"michelle <UNK> looks very different from ann <UNK> , but i swear they 're the same person ."
"i heard about michelle 's appearance on <UNK> , so i had to see it myself ."
"kerry of purposely <UNK> himself to get out of vietnam , to get medals , and/or further his future political career ."
i have to <UNK> chris matthews for putting an end to it .
chris put larry <UNK> on the spot as well .
the biggest problem is that some people are listening .
"is "" swift boat <UNK> for truth "" anything like "" fair and balanced "" or "" compassionate conservative ?"
""" i used to think <UNK> <UNK> was closer to the truth , things are definitely swinging <UNK> 's way ."
here 's a urllink link to the newest proven liar of <UNK> .
"since i 'm always calling bush - dubya , i was wondering why the rest of the bush crew do n't have appropriate <UNK> too ."
john <UNK> could become <UNK> ( it 's funny on a couple levels .
plus <UNK> could suggest he 's a screw - up ) .
please see the urllink <UNK> for various meanings .
tom ridge might be named <UNK> ( every good ol ' boy network needs a <UNK> ) .
doug <UNK> would become <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> ( keeping with the good ol ' boy theme ) .
"<UNK> rice would simply be candy or <UNK> ( see <UNK> sounds like candy , which is sweet because of sugar , thus <UNK> ."
dick cheney would remain dick ( no irony there ) .
"i 'm not that up on rural <UNK> , so i could use some help ."
"it 's a great town ; not too crowded , all the <UNK> ."
i 'm not sure why anyone would ride bush 's <UNK> . but
"then , mitch was <UNK> in the collapse of our ( u.s ."
"economy , not indiana 's ) as director of the office of management and budget ( <UNK> ) ."
the news is that my man mitch was arrested for selling marijuana and <UNK> .
"he was convicted for possession of marijuana , or something ."
"i 'm probably getting some of the details wrong , but i tend to pay more attention to national politics instead of local ."
"i do n't know that mitch has run as a bill <UNK> kind of republican , so i 'm not calling him a hypocrite ."
"it is funny that mitch was employed by a major <UNK> company , though ."
"anyway , it ends up that joe <UNK> had a thing for the chronic when he was in his twenties , as well ."
so really this is a non - issue in the campaign .
i have to wonder about mitch 's time in the bush administration .
did they hold aa meetings in the <UNK> office ?
did mitch and dubya sneak off to the lincoln bedroom for a <UNK> ?
does my man mitch ever have <UNK> from the <UNK> ?
"dunno , he does n't have any <UNK> about vietnam , though , as he took advantage of student and health <UNK> ( and a high draft number ) ."
<UNK> was a navy pilot shot down over vietnam and spent <#> months as a <UNK> .
military service should not be a deciding factor in <UNK> officials .
how well mitch fit in with the rest of the <UNK> .
why does the republican party get so much credit for patriotism ?
"the <UNK> of the <UNK> campaign are integrity , health care , jobs , state government reform , and education ."
integrity - my man mitch wants to end fraud and corruption .
"where was he for <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , and the sweet contracts that went to <UNK> and <UNK> ?"
no way he 's going to help with the rising cost of health care .
"yeah , nice job destroying the economy and losing jobs ."
mitch might be able to give advice on what not to do in order to grow the economy .
"government reform - the republicans typically want to <UNK> social programs , but mitch worked for the bush administration ."
i guess the government might explode in size under mitch .
too much or too little is not the answer .
leave no child left behind must mean something different to conservatives .
"if i 'm way off base on anything , i apologize ; but then , you came here for my opinion ."
"i did buy a new game for my computer , though ."
it 's called the political machine from <UNK> .
"i am glad to report that in my first attempt , <UNK> easily <UNK> <UNK> . in my second game"
", the <UNK> combination of <UNK> did n't even break a sweat against <UNK> and someone , i do n't remember who the other loser was ."
i think the biggest complaint that i have is that it does n't require that much thought on issues .
you just need to <UNK> to the <UNK> in major states .
"oh well , maybe i will have something more for you tomorrow ."
"basketball and their recent urllink <UNK> at the hands of <UNK> <UNK> and italy , and their horrible <UNK> in the world <UNK> ."
the world <UNK> were supposed to be a wake - up call to u.s .
the loss to italy was supposed to be a wake - up call to u.s .
the loss to <UNK> <UNK> might be something more .
this recent loss may be a slap in u.s .
which brings me back to larry bird 's ill - <UNK> <UNK> about the urllink decline of white players in the nba .
there are plenty of white players in the nba .
there are even quite a few good white players in the nba .

"during our <#> minutes out there , a huge black cloud came up and really <UNK> things down ."
"after i had dug out all of the weeds that i was planning to pull , i let everyone come in ."
i absolutely hate going to the grocery store !
"however , i do know that whatever we manage to buy will have to last us for about <#> full weeks until tim 's next pay check ."
it never ends and i feel like no matter how much we struggle we are never going to see that light at the end of the tunnel .
"on top of having to buy groceries , we also have to buy the kids shoes , clothes and supplies for school ."
i really wish our school district would get on the bandwagon with sending out the school supply list early .
"shoot , i would settle for having them mail them out to us a week or so before school starts ."
"i weighed in ( actually yesterday ) and discovered that i have lost <#> whole pounds . again , "" yay for me "" !"
i have always been someone that struggles with my weight .
my hubby and i have decided that we are ready to start doing whatever we can to lose some much needed weight .
all we have done so far is to cut back a lot on what we eat .
"since february when his position changed at work , he is now home every evening , so we started eating a lot more ; mainly sweets ."
"so , we have cut them out and only allow ourselves something sweet ( only in <UNK> ) over the weekend ."
"i eat mostly chicken for my dinner every day , but will only eat half of a piece and save the other half for lunch the next day ."
"tim , on the other hand , has just about stopped eating ."
he is basically eating a few crackers while he is at work and then eating whatever i serve to him for dinner .
"does n't sound too healthy to me , but i think he is just trying to get his stomach to shrink a little ."
it is my plan to start trying to do a workout every day once school starts back up for the kids .
"however , i have no idea ( right now ) how i am going to manage this since the only <UNK> we have are all in <UNK> ."
"needless to say , our bedroom is way to crowded ( with junk ) to attempt doing a workout in there ."
so that leaves me having to use <#> of the kids ' rooms for my workout .
"of course , i could try to sell my <UNK> tapes and try to get some <UNK> on dvd ."
"believe it or not , we are now having some cooler weather here in tennessee ."
we had some rain yesterday and last night and today it is sooo gorgeous out there .
"still looks like the bottom is going to drop at any time , though ."
i have even heard that we will be having <UNK> this weekend in the <UNK> .
i ca n't wait to be able to sleep with the windows open :) .
i have still been playing around with the codes today .
"trying really hard to figure out how to do a calendar in here , but have n't been able to figure that <#> out yet ."
"have come across a couple of codes , but none of them were exactly what i was wanting <UNK>"
"i think out of the <#> , i like this <#> the best :p ."
it is going to look so pretty when it is finally done .
"tim is not going to have to work this weekend "" yay "" ."
"they were n't too sure if they wanted to go , though ."
"i looked for the 5th harry potter book , but they did n't have it ."
i did see <#> book for toxic people and how to deal with the ones in your life and another book called <UNK> .
i did n't check either of them out because they look sooo long and i was really wanting hp ( haha ) .
sorry that it has been a few days since i posted .
i have been playing around with the coding and figured out how to add buttons .
i am also very slowly learning how to change the color of things in here to be more of what i like .
i have now completed <#> of the baby blankets and am working on the third <#> .
"i started the third <#> yesterday , but did not like how it was coming out ."
i am so much happier with this pattern than the <#> that i was trying to do .
i have even collected several articles that i can use in future <UNK> .
now i just need some <UNK> to <UNK> a contest for us again .
i finished the first blanket out of the <#> blanket order and started to work on the next <#> .
i would say that i am over a <#> of the way done with it already ;) .
i found a couple of <UNK> patterns that i really like .
i hope to start on <#> of them really soon .
"i hope to have some buttons added soon , but i am not that great with html so you will have to bear with me ."
it is something that i might play around with over the weekend while tim is gone .
"he is leaving for florida in the morning , flying down , staying the night and driving back on sunday ."
we had some storms roll through in the middle of the night and i guess the <UNK> decided to stick around .
"it feels wonderful out there with a nice breeze and no humidity at all , but just gray skies ."
"on a good note , i have finished up the first blanket out of my <#> blanket order that i received over the weekend ."
i hope to start on the second blanket tomorrow .
another good note is that i have been contacted about another blanket .
i am just <UNK> by these orders all of a sudden .
i think it is the lord 's way of blessing me with things to do since school is about to start back .
<#> group is <UNK> urllink ( <UNK> ) and i will be helping out with a yarn <UNK> :) .
the other group is middle tennessee moms ( urllink <UNK> ) where i am going to help out with running some events within the group .
spent some time today working on the newsletter and got it sent out by 8:30 .
that is a big deal for me because it usually takes me a couple of hours to finish up the newsletter and then get it sent out .
i had the newsletter out this morning by the time i am usually getting online .
"so , "" yay "" for me ;) ."
i have an order for <#> blankets that came in this past weekend that i am currently working on .
i worked for a couple of hours on <#> of the blankets earlier this morning .
should have it completed no later than this weekend .
i have just created this blog and am still in the process of learning my way around .
i hope to post current <UNK> projects that i am working on as well as events that i am participating in .
"like most of the <UNK> that you can recall in your head , you do n't know where they came from , they are just there ."
i would suppose that this is <#> of those <UNK> that has been around for quite some time in the big scheme of things .
"i say that because it involves a penny ... who would think today about a penny being the <UNK> of "" luck ."
i am well known in my little circle of <#> of tossing <UNK> <UNK> about to spread as much luck for others as i can .
"forget about finding a "" <UNK> machine "" to take your <UNK> also ."
and that pretty much limits your <UNK> available with less than <#> cents worth of <UNK> .
watch the expression on the <UNK> face if you try to count out more than <#> to <#> cents worth of <UNK> to them .
"could n't that money be used instead to fund the <UNK> so they can give money to an "" artist "" who <UNK> with poop ?"
"back to my original thought , of why should it be lucky to pick up a penny ."
"now a <UNK> , that 's a <UNK> different story ."
""" too <UNK> prompt service "" , at least that 's what i thought "" <UNK> "" always meant ."
"but the <UNK> "" tip "" is something that has taken on a life of its own ."
"now i 'm all for rewarding effort in any arena , but a tip should be just that , "" a reward "" ."
"so why is it that merely placing an order in a restaurant requires me to "" reward "" the employee that brings that order to me ?"
am i not paying fair - market value for that order to start with ? in any other sales environment
", i am paying the <UNK> amount of overhead to cover items such as salary for the particular item that i purchase ."
"as the customer , i should not be required to directly fund an employee 's salary ."
"that is why there is such a thing as overhead , which is figured in the actual price i pay ."
i should be free to offer a <UNK> of my own choosing .
a <UNK> is a small amount of money given for services <UNK> .
"because a "" good "" <UNK> can make a killing !"
"be <UNK> , <UNK> needs , and simply come back around every once in a while and ask"
"i have gone as far as leaving a <UNK> tip before , rather than nothing at all , just so the <UNK> gets the message ."
thinking maybe it would give them a hint about their establishment 's service .

feeling sick or <UNK> ( <UNK> ) excessive <UNK> heavy <UNK> feeling <UNK> ( <UNK> ) stomach ache ( general discomfort or a dull ache )
<UNK> <#> helps restore your <UNK> ' natural <UNK> rhythm and therefore helps to move food normally through the system .

the story of the arrogant college player who <UNK> his team is unfortunately a familiar <#> .
just do n't apply that to former kansas forward david <UNK> .

""" i just think people got to understand that i went there to play for somebody else and he left and we got a new coach"

""" because he can score the ball on the block and he can step out and shoot ."
he is a size guy and he is not stuck around the basket - he can step out and make <UNK> .
"i always thought that was his strength . """
<UNK> 's comments ironically confirm <UNK> 's thoughts that the kansas system was not the best fit .
it does n't mean that self did something wrong .
it does n't mean that <UNK> did something wrong .

"listen to the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the <UNK> ."

i remember the first day of school when i was <#> years old .
my mom put me in 1st grade in a public school in maryland .
i was like an alien who had woken up in a completely different world .
i learned english in front of the tv watching electric company and <UNK> street .
"so , this morning taking my kids to their first day at a new school was harder for me than them ."
my daughter holds my hand when she senses i’m about to get emotional about dropping her off in her new 2nd grade class .
whoever first realized children were wiser than adults must have been a very <UNK> person .
"yesterday , at work , i spoke with a mother who lost her son to a drunk driver this past weekend ."
always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do .
do n't bother just to be better than your <UNK> or <UNK> .
""" the search for happiness is <#> of the chief sources of <UNK> . """

i was up late last night trying to find the <UNK> <UNK> to a <#> <UNK> all over the world .
"there are really good deals to <UNK> right now , in case you want to take advantage of that ."
i am european in the sense that i also feel summer is the perfect time for a month long vacation .
"when i was in europe <#> summer , it was great to see an entire city go on vacation .... the <UNK> down in the atmosphere was <UNK> ."
i enjoy <UNK> down and i think we need to do more of it .
"sometimes , i really think about becoming a teacher so that i can travel ."
i never learned so much about others or myself as when i went to europe for <#> months .
""" to accomplish great things , we must not only act , but also dream ; not only plan , but also believe . """
i think in part its the hunt of <UNK> ' that i love but more than anything its like going back in time .
my friend and i found a <UNK> dress that was made in the depression era ... amazing that women were making dresses out of paper !
we spent about <#> hours this saturday digging through old things that i 'd love to buy or wish i could fit ....
how is it that all the women back then had <#> inch <UNK> ?
i keep trying to think of a way to <UNK> things i enjoy into an actual <UNK> while being creative .
what if we find out we can do our <UNK> what ?
that ’s a <UNK> being aware of ones own power and <UNK>
another thing we talked about is how we assume we have to know exactly what we want when more than likely it ’s a matter of <UNK> by that
i mean we can try a lot of different things in the same field of interest .
"the quote for today : "" women are meant to be loved , not to be understood . """
""" the proof of the little prince 's existence is that he was delightful , that he laughed and that he wanted a sheep ."

children should be very understanding of grown - ups .
"but of course , those of us who understand life could n't care less about numbers !"
i should have liked to begin this story like a fairy tale .
"yesterday , was a day for me that <UNK> the <UNK> of children in the world ."
i heard in detail from my <#> kids the story of how they found a baby <UNK> in the backyard .
my kids are older than <#> yet they still manage to find the magic in all of the small things around them .
i hope that is a <UNK> they will carry throughout their life .
it was hot and the cement was <UNK> heat up my legs .
i remembered today how when i was a kid i was fascinated by the idea of <UNK> an egg on the pavement .
i had heard through other kids in the know that in texas it was hot enough to do so .
we spent <#> summer in austin when i was <#> trying to do this very thing .
cute how when you are a kid doubt hardly ever <UNK> into your mind .
i do n't remember ever <UNK> the egg but we sure had a blast trying .
i see so many women hurting themselves by living in this type of <UNK> .
i wonder sometimes is love suppose to be this difficult and if so why ? ?
"i have this <UNK> book called "" love letters "" , it is filled with copies of authentic letters between lovers ..."
i love to pull it out and read them .
but i guarantee you that i was <#> of those lovers in a past life writing back and forth to someone with a passion that hurt .
i 've always know since i was little that i would find that ... but its something i wo n't compromise about -- at least not anymore .
if the past has taught me anything it 's that .
"well , here i am in the world of blog ."
i guess i better find something to talk about .
i plan on ranting and <UNK> just basically being my <UNK> self .
<#> thing for sure is that i am beginning to embrace my inner geek and i 'm feeling good about that .
i 'm not worried on what scale though .
so last night in class we watched this really cool bill <UNK> 's video ...
he talked about everything from <UNK> to the culture of brand loyalty .
it 's amazing that people are able to create such <UNK> jobs for themselves .
"next , bill <UNK> a <UNK> and they discussed the aspect of evil and what it means ...."
i need to buy her book and do a book report on it for my blog .
she did say <#> thing which struck a cord ...
bill asked her if we were a moral society ...
it <UNK> her it seemed and she said in degrees we are and that we tend to forget that we make or create our own realities .
i wait for life to happen to me and forget i have the power to make things happen .
so today i decided i would do some research on <UNK> and i found this association and wrote for their help in starting a group at <UNK> 's .
maybe it 's the times we live in right now
but i 'm really pumped lately to make changes and to be a part of positive changes in this country .
i believe in the <UNK> effect so why the hell not ya know .
i figure all i have to lose is this way of life ...
kerry may not be perfect but i want to say i tried to get bush out
... it 's just too much all this stuff i read about everyday with the war .
i 'm too happy a person lately to let anything weigh me down though .
"i do n't know what to think about this damn weather , but yesterday it was <#> and sunny , today it is <#> and cloudy !"
no wonder people are sick and <UNK> the hospital ! !
we have more people with <UNK> and just being sick than usual during this time of the year .
i wish this damn weather would figure itself out and let us have a season ! !
the <UNK> are the team to beat right now !
the have been getting some big breaks and good pitching from a staff that was n't supposed to be worth a damn !
i am worried that their luck will run out once the post season arrives but until then i am <UNK> hard for the <UNK> ! ! ! here at home
", logan is growing like a weed on miracle grow ! !"

i am soooo thankful that i have a beautiful healthy little girl that her mother and i can spoil and love !
just found out that the state of missouri ( where i hail from ) has voted to ban gay marriage .
i do n't care if any <#> people who love each other want to get married .
"people need to wake up and realize that there is nothing wrong with <#> people , gay or not , getting married ."
i am not happy today ! the damn <UNK> lost to the <UNK> ! ! !
the ' <UNK> are horrible this year and supposedly the best team in baseball lost to them !
i am tired and have to work tonight at the hospital again .
"will probably get stuck with a bunch of confused people that i ca n't stand , not to mention the patients ! just a quick rant"
", hope the cards get their heads out of their asses tonight d"
"i am pretty new at all of this stuff , but wanted a place to just be able to rant if i feel like it ."
so this seems like a good place to start .
"i never thought that having a daughter would change a person , but boy does it ! !"

my wife is extremely cool and understanding about the hidden geek that <UNK> within me .
i always joke and tell her if i would just gain another <UNK> <#> pounds and grow a bad <UNK>
", she would be married to the comic book guy from the simpsons ."
and i traveled to sin city to hang out with other trek fans from around the world .
"now , i am not the dyed in the wool , name that episode , have that <UNK> or wear that costume kind of a fan ."
i am just the guy who likes the <UNK> and has followed it ...
<UNK> ... a little more than your average television viewer .
"i can remember episodes , but not the name of the <UNK> guy who colored the <UNK> space rock that <UNK> hit the <UNK> guy with on that planet --"
oh <UNK> it was a <UNK> he hit with the <UNK> rock .
"see , more information than some , not as much as others ."
my inner trek guy was having a lot of fun .
a few of the famous people like <UNK> and <UNK> and i got to see many of the not so famous people .
"i got to shake hands with wil wheaton , which was a highlight since i had just finished reading his second book ."
"i am more of a "" do n't read the book , wait for the movie "" kind of guy so i hardly ever read anything cover to cover ."
"it was a great experience meeting my "" favorite author "" in and of itself ."
"now , i know i said my wife is n't a huge science fiction fan , but she does have a secret soft spot for <UNK> <UNK> ."
"during the convention , she got to meet <UNK> jefferson , jr ."
", the guy who played <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and even got him to call her little brother ."
<UNK> to call her brother and talk to him .
and they talked for almost ten minutes before he closed the cell phone and signed a picture for her brother .
<#> of the things i noticed that truly <UNK> me was the number of <UNK> people that attended .
"seeing those fans enjoying themselves , laughing and dressing up in <UNK> uniforms made any problems i might have brought with me seem very <UNK> and petty ."
"life is also to short to drink cheap beer , but i learned that somewhere else ."
"throughout the convention , i could see a <UNK> in my wife 's eye that told me she knew she had done a good thing by bringing me ."
i was able to forget about work and the <UNK> that accompany it and just lose myself in the fantasy .
"i walked around the exhibit hall saying "" this is so freakin ' cool "" for the first <#> hours that we were there ."
i held her hand and showed her props and pictures that brought back a flood of memories from my childhood and even my college days .
i pointed out people signing <UNK> and told her who they were and what their part of the show was .
"i took pictures of stars as well as pictures of her with a <UNK> , and <UNK> and a giant <UNK> ."
"i am not sure if she thought it was as cool as i did , but she <UNK> me and smiled big for the camera ."
"i love my wife for many reasons , but today , i love her for letting me be a kid !"
i have <UNK> with the idea of creating an online journal for a while now .
"of course , i want to be somewhat creative , instead of just laying down all the complaints and whining that i seem to <UNK> throughout my day ."
"so , time will tell exactly what this blog will <UNK> into ."
things have happened lately that have given me cause to reflect on that thought .
"you have to understand , i am a big guy ."
i have a deep voice and it ... ummm ... carries quiet well .
"anyway , i can say just about anything and people think i am "" raising my voice "" or "" yelling "" ."
i am also a high school principal in a small texas school .
"now , i doubt that anyone has really warm , fuzzy memories of their school principal ."
"usually , we are the bad guys , the discipline <UNK> and privilege <UNK> away ."
"couple that fact with my <UNK> and <UNK> , and i sometimes get a label of "" <UNK> and heavy handed "" ."
"now , i have a great <UNK> with most all the students and teachers ."
"they all know i have an open door policy and they can , and do , drop in any time ."
"moral is up , scores are good , discipline works and we are <UNK> in a very rapid fashion to being <#> of the top schools in the area ."
"i need to be hold teachers <UNK> , without hurting their feelings ."
"i need to have discipline on campus , but i need to "" <UNK> "" certain things and certain students ."
"so , all the work i have done over the last several years and , especially over the last year , was completely <UNK> ."
"now , here is something people may not have figured out about me ."
"i love what i do , i mean , i truly love it ."
"i have never had another job that was so fun , fulfilling and <UNK> ."
"i have a job where i get to take risks , i get to lead and i get to make a difference ."
"i love it so much that i am willing to put up with the endless paperwork , the irrational and irritated parents and the <UNK> teacher and/or student ."
i can even handle all the <UNK> criticism from people who should either try the job for a day or shut the hell up .
"unless you know the job , you have no idea how to do the job ."
"ah well , it will just be another challenge and another opportunity to "" grow as a person and as a professional "" ."
"this year i will "" cry without <UNK> , talk without speaking and scream without raising my voice "" ."
"see , now was n't that positive ? ?"
"<UNK> . , so apparently i am going to whine a little within these <UNK> halls ."
i 'll be a happier - go - <UNK> - blog -
friday eve after work i drove to new <UNK> .
it was my first long car drive in ages .
"then i felt my chest <UNK> <UNK> was it panic , or was i going to <UNK> ? and driving whilst popping <UNK> is probably not a good idea ."
"but i eventually chilled out , and made it to my destination ."
her life is getting very twin <UNK> up there .
first i met the girl she met by making out with her at the bar a few weeks ago .
"then we went to the basement of the bar with her , the <UNK> and some other guy to smoke <UNK> this guy had huge buds with him ."
then i met her other friend -- ex <UNK> porn star w/ <#> kids and a <#> year old boyfriend .
"we had a <UNK> , more smoking of the <UNK> , and meat on sticks ."
the brother of ex <UNK> boyfriend was there .
he 's going to become a <UNK> soon .
he introduced me to the term ' lot <UNK> ' the ho ' of the <UNK> world .
the brothers are from a small town in maine where there 's nothing around .
"i asked what people did with themselves up there , and they said ' drugs ' ."
"then <#> <UNK> came over , and we smoked up w/ them ."
now i know why j. is getting high so much !
it got so cold at night we had to light a fire .
saturday we went to some <UNK> stores -- my favorite activity up there .
i bought my usual crap and found a nice bad art painting .
maybe i 'll figure out later how to put them up here .
"we also sat on a <UNK> at this beautiful lake , and there was no <#> there !"
"i did n't panic , so i think i <UNK> that irrational fear . today i got a <UNK> <UNK> !"
so i suppose its a good idea to check .
"so he put the <UNK> stuff on my lower belly and did his thing , and i thought that was it ."
"then he says , ' you can go to the bathroom now , then we 'll do the other part ' ?"
"so he did check my <UNK> , then he pulls out this big <UNK> and tells me i 'm gonna insert it you know where ."
i did n't know i was in for all that !
the <#> people i was going to see cancelled on <UNK> i 'm sure going out of town when people can see places did n't help .
he sounded super aggressive and annoying on the phone .
he was the person i was least excited about meeting .
then he said he shared a dog w/ his <UNK> and would have it a couple weeks out of the month .
but then he said it was a <#> <UNK> .
"and that it did n't bark , it just <UNK> , and it sounded so cute !"
"i 'm supposed to see a couple people tomorrow , but i think this guy might work ."
maybe he can introduce me to a nice investment <UNK> ; )
"so , i 've been on quite a journey the last few months ."
this thing is probably a piece of cake for the usual teenagers who get this .
"for me , a <#> year old , its been a complete nightmare !"
"the <UNK> came right before my birthday , may <#> ."
"freaking out about my symptoms , and they 've done nothing but tell me i could use a good shrink and <UNK> ."
"so today i 've started working w/ a <UNK> dr my coworker recommended , so we 'll see how it goes ."
i just bought or was shipped a <UNK> of <UNK> ...
"i got <UNK> <UNK> , some kind of <UNK> ."
"some pills made out of a few different mushrooms , <UNK> immune support pills , <UNK> oil , a recipe for a shake to make every morning ."
i 'm looking forward to seeing what this <UNK> hopefully it will do something .
"i do feel alot better than i did last month , but hey , it ca n't hurt to see if i can get in really good shape ."
after this we 're gonna look into any <UNK> components to the way i feel .
"once i figure out how to put links on this thing , i 'll hook you up !"
"in other news , i 'm looking for a new <UNK> ."
last <#> is <UNK> <UNK> that s a whole other story .
was really excited when a nurse was interested in moving in !
"i <UNK> do n't like to talk about myself much , so we 'll see if i can get into a me me me mode ."
or it could be my observations on things .
"my job consists of me spending <#> hours a day w/ a computer , so nothing too exciting there ."
urllink <UNK> commenting and <UNK> have been added to this blog .
urllink urllink ah <UNK> & <UNK> originally uploaded by urllink <UNK> the <UNK> .
urllink urllink the crucial scene <UNK> <UNK> .
urllink urllink the interview originally uploaded by urllink <UNK> the <UNK> .
urllink <UNK> originally uploaded by urllink <UNK> the <UNK> .
"the phrase above , loosely translated into english , means "" wearing a traditional <UNK> dress and <UNK> like an idiot "" ."
"i had just finished writing my <UNK> for "" <UNK> "" then ."
"tonight , some months later , the finished film is scheduled to be <UNK> for some journalists and fellow bloggers , <UNK> ."
so you can well imagine that the smile on my face <UNK> is so wide as to make me look like a total <UNK> .
urllink urllink <UNK> <UNK> originally uploaded by urllink <UNK> the <UNK> .
“ you don’t have to understand people to love them .
"” i set myself the task of <UNK> this feeling in “ <UNK> ” , even before i typed the first word of the script ."
"when i was a little girl , my father had a thing about a <UNK> record of <UNK> francis singing italian love songs ."
"he would play it over and over , until i could sing “"
"o sole <UNK> ” with great feeling , without understanding a word of what i was singing ."
"much later , i read a confession the irish poet <UNK> made concerning the feelings he had about “"
", the <UNK> prize winning book of poetry by <UNK> <UNK> , translated into english from the original <UNK> ."
"a story about <#> young people in love , who come from totally different family and social <UNK> ."
it ’s important to note here that the last thing i wanted was to make the central crisis in “ <UNK> ” a racial <#> .
i have never believed that race was ever a real issue when people hated <#> another .
"i have always found , without fail , that racism was just surface stuff ."
"when i scratched that surface and went just a little deeper , i <UNK> found that that <UNK> was rooted in more basic human weaknesses like fear or greed ."
first love has always fascinated me because it happens to you at a time when you have not yet learned to lie to yourself .
"with first love , within <#> minutes , you accept the other person for everything that they are , <UNK> and all ."
i believe that our first love is the <UNK> love of all .
"unfortunately , most people i know do not even believe there is such a thing as “ true love ” ."
they remind me of the last words in a poem by <UNK> <UNK> .
“ let the people who never find true love believe that there is no such thing .
their faith will make it easier for them to live and die . ”
"at <#> , i have directed only eleven halfway decent tv commercials , made <#> tv movie , and <#> feature film ."
i might call myself an artist if i only knew what art was .
"i cringe when someone says they like art films , or worse , that they want to make art films ."
"i reckon they 're my favourite because i keep going back to them from time to time , over and over again , and they move me every time ."
the <#> living directors whose new works i feel compelled to watch as soon as i can are pedro <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> .
"if what little i 've said so far <UNK> your interest even a little , i 'd like to chat about film with you . and"
"let me just say , i do n't want another <UNK> <#> years with bush ."
"on the other hand , i do n't want <#> years with kerry ."
what i believe will happen after <#> of these <UNK> gets elected .
"the people will rise up , get it together , and find a true leader for our country ... out of the shit grows <UNK> !"
"hang on , its only going to smell worse during the next <#> years ."
hopefully i do n't become obsessed about entering info daily here ...
"truth be told , there is nothing on tv ."
"saw an interesting personal license plate "" no <UNK> ... someone obviously not familiar with american culture ."
lets get into some little things that piss me off .
someone decided to <UNK> <UNK> to dead cops and people of <UNK> .
"now , i 'm not <UNK> to a cop being killed on the job , but do we really have to name a freeway after them ?"
"they chose there job , and knew the risk ..."
i 'm sure i will not be allowed to get my street re - named after my dead cat ! and
did i miss her bus ride on the <#> freeway when i was growing up ?
commercial <UNK> . taking the tide freeway east to the <UNK> <UNK> north to connect to the <UNK> freeway east ...
"ok , i 'm a little nervous as this is my first blog post ever !"
"i am not politically correct , nor am i racist ."
i wish very much that i can eventually come off all drugs .
"<#> i saw notes on several people 's blogs re the "" next blog "" on the tool bar at the top of our own blogs ."
"i say current because i did some tests and the "" next "" blog <UNK> wildly from second to second ."
"it 's a mirror of life : who you are beside , who you "" touch "" changes dramatically from <#> breath to the next ."
"i could n't read a damned word , but the message was as clear as glass ."
makes my semi - sane <UNK> quite mundane .
"briefly : this man drove from the canadian <UNK> to toronto , a centre of evil activity as far as he was concerned ."
he stopped into a park before carrying out his self imposed mission for a rest and was approached by a very friendly dog .
"so , the man went and found a <UNK> and <UNK> himself ."
"that frustration , that <UNK> rage , <UNK> ."
random <#> my sleep 's been a bit <UNK> again .
"so i laid there at <#> point , staring at the overhead light in the bedroom ceiling ."
and i remembered the shock and shame when my family doctor came into the hospital last year to see me when he was told i was committed .
"if i could , i would have turned and run from the building ."
so i 'd always liked him but thought of him as ....
""" somehow because of the <UNK> of his nurses ."
<UNK> <UNK> were so active then ) and he talked to me .
"calmly , honestly and i could see both the concern and the error of my ways ."
"he was a strongly <UNK> , caring doctor , and all he wanted to do was help me ."
"that sudden knowledge helped me , knowing that this man , even though i had judged him badly , was an official "" presence "" in my corner ."
you 'll have to remember that at this point my <UNK> and i were n't getting along at all .
p. was worried and wanted to make sure i got the help i needed .
"random <#> adam and i had another "" date "" last night ."
we saw alien vs. predator ( a movie i agreed to see since his team won the <UNK> world series thursday night ) .
- he reminded me so much of me at that age .
"i just hope with everything i have that he does n't follow me further down the path , that he stays as "" normal "" as he is now ."
it would break my heart to have him end up like me .
"time for me to make some pancakes , i think ."
apparently my blood levels are now finally in the low end of the acceptable range rather than so low they are off the chart .
so he does n't want to <UNK> with the <UNK> .
so i guess he interpreted that as room for improvement .
but then he realized that i 'm already taking the <#> <UNK> recommended dose of the <UNK>
but he 's asked me to come back in <#> weeks rather than <#> and is going to see if i can be part of the <UNK> study .
"it would be a <#> year commitment , more frequent doctor visits ."
my only <UNK> is having to explain to work that i might have some time i have to take for blood work etc .
but i do n't want to put the cart before the horse -
i 'll wait a day or <#> before i <UNK> <UNK> into explaining things .
"but i want to take a moment to breathe and think this through before i <UNK> any "" mental illness "" <UNK> at work ."
not high on my list of things to get accomplished .
"the other thing that happened was adam 's team won the "" american league "" championship of his baseball ."
i was jumping and screaming like he 'd just won the lottery .
"the final championship "" world series "" is likely thursday ."
tomorrow is some time that the coach has requested at the <UNK> cage .
"so , i 've come home , done some laundry and have a <UNK> <UNK> cake cooking ."
it 's not like i 'm playing with knives again yet .
"i do n't want to be too honest about what has occurred in my mind the past <#> weeks , because i really do n't want another increase ."
"i was quite upset that he increased things last time , after having gone a good <#> months with no <UNK> ."
the only benefit to last time was that there was no <UNK> weight gain with the <#> % increase in <UNK> .
i think that my decision to leave the msn group has been a healthy <#> .
"<UNK> here , where i do n't feel like i have to step on <UNK> , is much more relaxed , less <UNK> with tension and angst ."
had to have something to do in there other than play cards with that poor <UNK> kid ...
i mean how many games of gin can you play in <#> night ? )
"as usual , it found me again , much to my <UNK> ."
have to dry my hair ( just had a shower ) and time to eat a little bit - popcorn and <UNK> :-)
rob 's not feeling well . a kind of <UNK> 's revenge ... perhaps better called <UNK> 's revenge .
so adam and i went out for a date .
"he was so proud then of being the big boy , of helping mommy ."
"now , i catch his eye watching the young <UNK> at the table behind us ."
"he 's such a good , healthy kid ."
"after dinner ( which was at <UNK> 's ) we went to see i , robot ."
"rob and i had seen it alone , and i did n't mind seeing it again with adam ."
he was fascinated by the computer animation and <UNK> that that 's what he wants to do for a career - computer animation for movies .
i wish i could afford the flash programme he wants .
i'm creative enough that maybe i can find something that will kind of fill in the gap in the <UNK> until he gets into high school .
my day at work was really quite busy and i came quite close to just flipping on bruce .
"he 's an older man , and the details are really irrelevant but he started yelling at me for something that was n't my fault ."
"i mean really yelling , and he was shaking with rage , his eyes <UNK> with the pressure ."
"i contained myself though , which was good i suppose ."
"i could have done far worse , especially in my <UNK> <UNK> state ."
and the run i did when i got home was great - i shaved yet another minute off my time for the shorter run .
"l , the blogging partner of the other k woman with <UNK> , was surprised i could run on <UNK> ."
i take the <UNK> at about <#> pm ( <#> <UNK> ) .
the <UNK> ( <UNK> or <UNK> acid ) i take at about <#> am and <#> pm
( i honestly do n't remember the <UNK> - think the total is <#> <UNK> ) .
he 's a man i met via the <UNK> chat ( now <UNK> and moved to <UNK> ) .
he initially was of great help to me and <UNK> a great deal from a rapid cycling <UNK> with a strong <UNK> component .
he 's into <UNK> structure and culture and <UNK> like that .
"long story , but he and several others ( myself included ) went to an msn group started by another "" <UNK> "" ."
they were all pity - party <UNK> and i got sick of it .
"every time i mentioned something positive , <#> would change topics or conversation would cease ."
"complex - he feels i suffer , hence my departure from their <UNK> ."
"he keeps holding out an msn - framed hand to me , offering assistance where none is needed ."
"now , finally , the <UNK> is <UNK> up ."
"i 'm in <#> of those "" my meds are making me this way "" moods ."
"still we take it , with each dose a small drop of water on our <UNK> reminding us of the disorder ."
"i read something really quite fascinating , though , regarding the possible ( however <UNK> ) relationship that <UNK> may bear to <UNK> ."
"this process was first describes as an explanation for <UNK> , and may explain why certain <UNK> drugs are also effective in the treatment of <UNK> disorder ."
"it explains why sometimes the moods change , so damned fast , and take me so much by surprise , it almost leaves me <UNK> ."
"it 's such a helpless feeling , to not have control of your own mind ."
i know that the medication <UNK> me down .
"i do n't know that this post has made a lot of literary sense , but it 's made sense in the moment i wrote it ."
i 've got to <UNK> out so adam does n't seem me like this .
earlier in the morning i was so tired .
"my sleep was interrupted last night , which , considering the <UNK> effect of the <UNK> , is unusual ."
and i 've never been <#> to cope with missing or inadequate sleep .
by mid - day it started to improve .
"dinner went well - fish and <UNK> ( far from <UNK> <UNK> , but tasty nonetheless ) ."
"they had the <UNK> , i had salad ."
and now we 've just finished watching <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> .
"adam , at <#> , seems at an ok age to watch it ."
the worst you see is a few deep kisses and <#> girl in bra and underwear using a poster bed for a <UNK> post .
now i 'm just waiting for him to get out of the shower and
the <#> pm <UNK> 's kicked in big time and i 'm struggling .
tomorrow 's wednesday - week 's half done .
this is written by a partner of a woman with <UNK> .
it 's really quite fascinating to read some of the thoughts and frustrations ....
but he did have to deal with my <UNK> <UNK> last year .
the anniversary of that is coming up and i can sense it approaching on my <UNK> and it 's an uncomfortable feeling .
"you know , i drive by that hospital every day on my way from work ."
every freakin ' day i look over and picture myself curled in a ball sitting on the window <UNK> looking out .
"and it seems , some days , so easy to just let the floor fall from under me and <UNK> there again ."
"but i have to remind myself , sometimes daily , how adam and rob both count on me ."
"deep depression , with its <UNK> self - <UNK> , believe it or not , falls into that category as well ."
"self - <UNK> requires a huge amount of concentration on the self , to <UNK> and <UNK> every aspect of the self -"
and perhaps that 's why <UNK> ca n't do much - their internal energy is <UNK> by this destructive <UNK> .
people who have n't experienced it really ca n't understand what a mixed state is like .
"you have the excessive <UNK> energy of <UNK> , but the <UNK> <UNK> self - destructive spiral of depression ."
<UNK> rarely suicide - they do n't have the energy .
"for a person with <UNK> disorder , a mixed state is the most dangerous : it is the time of the highest suicide percentage ."
today was the first day i could trust myself to remove the letter <UNK> from my desk that someone put there <#> weeks ago .
"it 's double <UNK> and double <UNK> , and comes to quite a point at the end ."
the past week or so i 've been <UNK> a mixed episode .
today i moved it to the <UNK> area where it belonged .
"i 'm hoping that if i can string together a few more , i can extend it a bit ."
i want to see if i can make a <UNK> in this damned <#> lbs the <UNK> meds have added .
i am also extremely concerned about the <UNK> <UNK> next week .
he 's done another blood test on the <UNK> and i 'm afraid he 's going to raise it again .
"if i was alone , i 'd quit them , but i ca n't - rob would be so angry ."
"he knows it 's the only things keeping me alive and has been through so much , he 'd be furious at being put in that situation again ."
"he has said that he could n't take it again , seeing me in hospital and unable to leave ."
the poor guy 's been through so much .
there 's a challenge for everyone - get a <#> year old boy to take a shower .
i finally figured out why my hotmail would n't receive even test mails from my home address .
i was so paranoid - i figured no <#> was answering me .
"but then again - i had sent email after email to kevin to see how he was doing , when he was going off about being <UNK>"
"i sent him <#> , etc - and he 's on my approved list - i got <UNK> back ."
that 's <#> of the things that pissed me off and made me leave the msn group - no response .
"i felt like everytime i said something in response to a post etc , everyone else would either shut up or just change the topic ."
so i still say fuck 'em after all .
"yes i am a hotmail moron , but still , fuck em ."
"this posting is a community experiment that tests how a <UNK> , represented by this blog posting , <UNK> across <UNK> , physical space and time ."
it will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected .
it may also help to show which blogs ( and <UNK> sites ) are most <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> .
"please <UNK> your analysis of the data , and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post ( see url above ) ."
an e - mail message ” : browsing the web ( <UNK> through my <UNK> ) i posted this experiment at url :

"it 's hard to describe sometimes how i think , and feel ( are they separate , thought and emotion ?"
last night rob and i finally went out for a dinner date .
it 's not like we went to some $ <#> a plate place - just jack <UNK> .
i had a nice chicken <UNK> with some <UNK> cheese on it for a nice change .
<UNK> <UNK> is even more of an ass than he appears in the press .
not too bright either if he lets this kind of stuff be released in his name .
i was kind of hoping that it would be like when rob and i were first married and a dinner date ended up with a nasty fuck .
he sat down to watch the toronto rocks video ( about the <UNK> concert last summer with the stones and <UNK> etc ) instead .
so i had to resort to the old <UNK> thing and finally drew him away .
"fuck , it was so hard for me not to dwell on that , that he needs that kind of incentive ."
"i guess i am still dwelling on it since <#> hrs later or more , i 'm still thinking about it ."
he 's calling - he 's made <UNK> eggs for breakfast .
"i 've got my family - husband , son and me ."
they can have their little <UNK> <UNK> and leave me out and i 'll be just fucking fine thank you very much .
i 've walked alone before and i 'll do it again .
"i 'm a fucking <UNK> , a bull , i can bear any fucking weight , any fucking burden ."
"had a long drive for work today - <#> hours round trip , with a <#> <#> hr visit with a customer ."
that 's ok - gave me a trial order for $ <#> with promise for more to come .
so i went through <UNK> 's to get those <UNK> .
my system 's not used to that and now i 've got mcdonald 's revenge .
think it 's time for some alone time in the ladies room .... <UNK> .
but adam 's first baseball <UNK> game is tonight .
i 'm so excited for him .
he 's learned so much - not just the technical aspects of the game but the <UNK> of playing a team game as well .
"we have to leave within the <#> hr so i 'm off to get ready , things packed , etc ."
i feel somewhat more stable than earlier today and yesterday so hopefully i can hold that together and not shoot through the <UNK> and <UNK> him .
i came home and ran my just - shy - of - <#> - miles circuit . shaved a minute off the time .
"flick the switch was switched , and i was feeling wonderful , full of wonder , great and fantastic ."
i love the limits i can push my body to .
"it 's a drag that the <UNK> meds have caused the <#> lbs weight gain they have , but i fight against it still ."
i know i 'm slower when i run - <#> lbs will do that - but still i run . and
taking a while to type this properly because of inability to concentrate .
"underneath is <UNK> , <UNK> boiling and <UNK> to blow , smelling of <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i see people talking , hear them whispering and have the ultimate <UNK> in believing that they must be talking about me ."
their whispers travel on grey waves <UNK> past me and travel to the next .
i can hear the waves whisper sometimes : it is the sound of <UNK> <UNK> thighs <UNK> together down an empty hallway .
it is when i cease to realize the <UNK> nature of the thought that i know i 'm in trouble .
but it 's a day i 've lived to see the end of .
that in itself makes it a good <#> .
"the hippie and i have noticed that we fall rather naturally into very distinct , traditional gender roles ."
"and the other night , it was very very apparent that our friends jenn and harry do the same ."
"i mean , we went to their house for dinner , which was grilled by the men , after being prepared by the women ."
then jenn came back and we both <UNK> .
"funny -- i get a sense of satisfaction out of him <UNK> "" guy things "" as well ."
"and yes , i am pretty comfortable with this ."
it is bizarre to me how comfortable i am with it .
"i mean , i have multiple degrees and have always been pretty damned independent ."
"but this last year and a half with the hippie , i have learned that there is a bit of joy in <UNK> ."
i like that i do most of the cooking and he does most of the heavy lifting .
i like that i make the drinks for our friends who are over while he <UNK> them .
"i like the whole set - up , and how much i feel like he is taking care of me , while i am taking care of him ."
the weird thing is that i feel no less a feminist for all this .
"i am glad i have choices in things , and that i have had the opportunity to do what i want with my life ."
i am grateful to the women who came before me for fighting so that i could have those choices .
i am glad i have the same rights and the same power as he does .
i like that he listens to me and that he respects my brain even while he is grabbing my ass .
this is a great time to be a girl .
here i was ready to give up on my urllink wire things .
"here i was , all ready to throw in the towel ."
"not exactly sweeping the art nation , but hey -- it 's something . and damn , that feels good ."
my baby count for <#> is up to <#> .
it is really amazing to me how many people i know who are <UNK> at the same time .
"i mean , i know i am the right age for this , but damn people !"
do you have to do it all at once ? ?
"as a woman about to turn <#> , this does have an effect on me ."
i think thoughts like -- am i ever going to have <#> ?
"the jury is still out on that , but i feel the pressure of my age to make up my mind ."
"i ca n't wait too long , or my body will answer that question for me ."
"and yes , i realize this is slightly irrational ."
"i also think about the friends who are having babies now , and the ones who already have them -- really good friends ."
"i want our baby to have cool baby friends , too ."
"it sucked always being the baby , literally <#> years younger than the nearest kid ."
i want our baby to have that sense of belonging and community that i never had from having a bunch of family friends .
"like i said , the jury is still out ..."
dread it every day with every fiber of my being .
half the time it is all i can do not the throw up on the treadmill .
it is all i can do to make myself go .
"and sometimes i do n't , and it fills me with self - <UNK> . but here is the thing ."
"( not because he judges me , but because he worries about my health . )"
"right now i am heavier than i have ever been , and i feel it all through my body ."
i know that eventually i will come to like it .
i know that eventually i will even look forward to it .
i know because that has happened to me in the past .
i long for the day when my workout ends with <UNK> instead of exhaustion .
and i know it will come if i keep it up .
this gym we go to pushes the personal trainer like nobody 's business .
"and damn , how the hell can anyone afford <#> ?"
do i have to pay out hundreds and hundreds of dollars to someone so that i will feel guilty enough about not working out that i do it ?
i have to make myself <UNK> to another person to follow through with a commitment to myself now ? ? ?
and the other thing i totally fucking hate is how these <UNK> are so goal oriented .
""" we need to get your body fat percentage down to blah . """
""" what is your goal weight ? "" who the hell cares about that ! ?"
"i know , and anyone who has read anything about anything knows that this is all just simple math ."
"if you put more calories in than you <UNK> , you gain weight , and vice versa ."
"i mean , why ca n't i just focus on getting this shit into my daily routine ."
"and man , i know self discipline and denial are so not my strong suits ."
"sadly , our romantic weekend <UNK> was <UNK> by all the hurricane madness attacking the north carolina beaches ."
* sigh * no worries -- we will <UNK> it !
"but , some <UNK> activities on the part of our friend urllink steve were revealed as a result of the <UNK> ."
he noted that <UNK> do n't hit phoenix very often .
and he sent us to urllink sullivan 's for a birthday dinner on his tab .
"so we go to dinner , and dinner is great , as it always is at sullivan 's ."
", <UNK> wanted to slap him . still kinda want to slap him ."
i will remember it <UNK> on the actual day of my birthday .
yes -- i have finally stopped <UNK> and am cleaning out the last room in this apartment that needs to be totally <UNK> .
the bad thing is that this room has been the catch - all for everything since we moved in . and god is a lot of it crap !
"for example , why do we have all these bags of bags here ? ?"
? are we releasing the <UNK> within us both in this <#> tiny room in the house ?
i am trying really hard to stop being such a <UNK> -- throwing things away like crazy .
but dude -- i am keeping that morgan <UNK> can . anyway
<#> ) <UNK> passengers <#> ) noise noise noise ! ! !
some quotes written on random pieces of paper : certain organic chemicals of value to me are bound up in your body .
<UNK> <#> - <#> - <#> he was using a method of distraction as a <UNK> - upper for a lack of personal responsibility .
( no idea who said that ) <#> must have chaos within oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star .
<UNK> to my friend urllink sam for talking to me on the phone through a lot of the madness even though she could not be here in person ...
"i know sam is a true friend because i can call her "" dumbass "" and she does n't get mad ."
and i have to say -- i have been jealous . and angry . and lonely . all week . and
no -- i do n't miss working there at all !
i have been much happier since i lost that job actually .
but i do miss the people and the interaction and the social aspects of that job . and
all the people i miss are gathered in <#> place for the whole week .
but hey -- it is a trade - off right ?
"so to get out of my stupid , partially <UNK> induced funk , i went to the stained glass store ."
love being in there -- they have so many cool little things that are just <UNK> to me .
"hate trying to determine how much to charge people , however ."
i am in such a state with this job search that i wonder about everything i like to do -- could i make a living doing this ?
heh -- like i keep telling the hippie -- i really am just a farm wife at heart .
except for the actual <UNK> part -- screw that !
always wonderful to see them -- how i wish they would move home already ! !
"but like everyone else , they are <UNK> by the job market ."
i look for jobs for him almost as much as i look for myself !
"they are having a baby in the fall , so the drive to get them home is stronger than ever , and not even just for selfish reasons !"
:) i would give just about anything to get my friends all in <#> place !
oh well -- at least this way i have an excuse to travel . and
"speaking of travel , i have made some little <UNK> plans for me and the hippie ."
"so -- we are going to the beach to stay in a little <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , urllink the <UNK> ."
"but , oh the work to get it set up ..."
"driving today , after a grey and <UNK> morning , i was nearly overcome looking at the clouds ."
"i have been thinking about starting a blog for some time now , and have been strangely reluctant ."
"and i thought , "" am i ready for that ?"
"this thing is n't a real journal . if it were then i would n't be thinking so hard about it , editing myself ."
"perhaps , it is this book i am reading ."
""" only the impossible is worth the effort . """
"<#> person is <UNK> , yet weary of falling in love ."
"the other person is married , but growing apart from her spouse ."
from sweet <UNK> night of passion in paris ) to possibility ( following a planned yet chance encounter ) .
possibility ... that 's a killer concept is n't it ?
when is it time to let go of dreams and possibilities ?
how how how do i not utterly sell out ?
"you know who you are ... she says , "" more will be revealed . """
<UNK> rich said that anger can be a kind of genius if it 's acted on .
<UNK> <UNK> said that there are several uses for anger .
so i guess i must learn to do something with mine .
"they are <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and anxious ."
mine are just words after all ... an honest <UNK> or a <UNK> reaction .
i 'm simply expressing myself and loving others who do the same .
those who know me know i 'm full of hot air ... and they laugh and adore me all the more .
"we had a good giggle tonight , did n't we d ?"
everyone else can just go about their boring business and sleep walk themselves to death ... just stay out of my way and keep your needles to yourselves .
urllink i am <UNK> . not so much anymore ...
i think i am nicer and more grounded now .
it is a strange thing to watch a movie and feel like the writer was inside of your head .
"i imagine <UNK> 's struggles after her bus ride into nowhere to be intense , but if she just <UNK> she 'll get her happy ending ..."
it is this light that i attempt to write .
i am not talented and all attempts to string together beauty in the form of words fail miserably .
i have the gift for analysis and <UNK> ( which seems to be <UNK> ) .
"i must express these <UNK> ideas in order to calm my brain , to quiet the noise , and to <UNK> myself ."
urllink bored ... curious ... <UNK> ... all the reasons for this creation .
i really have no idea what i 'm doing .
"be kind , i am slow to join the 21st century ."
"either that , or i 'm watching absolutely fabulous and listening to my new <UNK> cds ."
"coming up to the elections though , i 'll try and post a little more ."
i hope you like reading my journal as much as like creating <UNK> social policy .
peter <UNK> is such a super <UNK> ( like the <UNK> song - my fave is dancing queen ) .
he 's announced that cool ' family package ' of his .
"( note : all women should be mothers , that way they 'd be stuck in the home and leave men 's work to men . )"
"it 's all part of our grand plan to make sure that all the children in australia are white , and that we have lots of children ."
"peter <UNK> is so super <UNK> , he should have a statue built ."
"i 'm not sure who the statue would be of , but a statue would be cool ."
"of course , they 'd also work during those <UNK> , but that 's all good ."
"peter <UNK> is so cool , but not as cool as my <UNK> ."
"plus , he 's so sexy , in a heterosexual , sort of non - sexual <UNK> sorta way ."
they can even <UNK> in cans and we can add <UNK> and sell it as coke !
"tony was really happy too , because it meant that people would n't use condoms and that 's the catholic way ."
"what a go - er , also in a non - homosexual way ."
it 's so cool that i work for tony <UNK> .
he 's just decided to try and ban the over - the - counter <UNK> pill .
"children are <UNK> things in that they cause all those <UNK> , <UNK> known as mothers , to buy lots of stuff , making our economy stronger . and"
"so i <UNK> his shoes and asked for the money , but he got all angry and poo - <UNK> at me and <UNK> off !"
"anyway , it 's a <UNK> great plan by tony ."
", that goes to my <UNK> , but tony comes a close second ."
"if only we could mass - produce babies , on a daily basis , and force them onto mothers who would be forced to buy them stuff ."
"money that i would n't see of course , but it goes toward the greater good . and by greater good , i mean america ."
i think the worst part was that he was n't white though .
i think <UNK> should launch a federal <UNK> into this .
"i mean , everyone so knew that he was the <UNK> ethnic guy , like how there were those <UNK> gay people in the other series ."
you know why ? ' cause australia respects it 's family values .
"cause that is so like the way it should be , yeah ?"
like in survivor ( i ca n't wait for that to come on again . ) that <UNK> amanda <UNK> could n't get off the couch to <UNK> trevor .
she should speak to <UNK> or something and lose all her fat .
i think my <UNK> should be in big brother <#> .
that way he 'll be even more popular than he already is .
"i wish those stupid der - brains , labor , would shut up already and realise that there are so <UNK> in iraq ."
"i mean , how dumb do you have to be to not realise that they had the weapons ?"
"otherwise , i mean , really , why did we invade iraq ?"
"i mean , we already have oil , so what ’s the point ?"
"if anyone is a weapon of mass destruction , besides amanda <UNK> , it would be that der - brain mark <UNK> ."
his stupidity has single - <UNK> been the driving force behind all the der - brains around the world .
"well , him and that <UNK> <UNK> bob brown ."
bob brown is a total wmd cause he ’s gay .
"i mean , if we dropped him on iraq , the whole place would be full of rainbow flags and stupid gay people and a few tree hugging <UNK> ."
"he also had a <UNK> , which is a lot cooler than that <UNK> <UNK> hat bob brown wears ."
"it ’s so dirty , those dirty <UNK> watching our beautiful <UNK> women ."
it ’s almost as dirty as this <UNK> movie i saw at club x. what a bunch of <UNK> .
they should all get face - <UNK> so they don’t look as <UNK> anymore .
they should try and look like my <UNK> . then <UNK> all be sexy <UNK> .
"all those silly <UNK> , known as society , have finally woken up and <UNK> the coffee and realised that private schools are so much cooler than public schools ."
"they have cool , sexy uniforms and cool , sexy people ."
"they do n't let us teach religion there and when i say religion , i mean <UNK> - we do n't want anyone teaching that muslim <UNK> religion ."
people should have a choice when it comes to their values .
"like those gays - they had a choice to become gay , and will ultimately be <UNK> on for their choice ."
"they should be <UNK> on , as should women , at least if i had my way ."
"my <UNK> agrees with me , but would never say it publicly , unfortunately ."
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had the right idea in <#> respect , anyway ."
"we should bring back the cane , i say ."
the cane sure beat some discipline into those <UNK> .
he got up and said all those ' countries ' in the pacific are in ' our patch ' .
"it 's so true though , all those smelly <UNK> are part of the usa ."
"when i say usa i mean the united states of australia , of course ."
"i think it 's time those <UNK> handed over their <UNK> to us properly , then we can run their countries properly ."
"we 'll <UNK> them , cut <UNK> , cut funding from everything except defense and then open up their land to <UNK> of property developers ."
"and if anyone <UNK> to it , we 've send in the riot police and break their <UNK> ."
but that 's what free speech is all about really .
"according to <UNK> , he 's also a love goddess ."
mark <UNK> has proved yet again that he 's a dirty <UNK> .
"he should get a <UNK> , he 'd be so much smarter and on par with my <UNK> ."
what that <UNK> <UNK> does n't see is that free trade is really really really <UNK> .
"even peter <UNK> says so , although he 'd never admit to that publicly ."
i was just reading how that <UNK> mark <UNK> first heard about super sexy tony <UNK> .
it reminds me of how i first heard about my <UNK> .
"i was on the john in the <UNK> building at sydney university , and i read some <UNK> <UNK> about my <UNK> ."
someone obviously had discovered his <UNK> and <UNK> him a ' <UNK> ' .
how i 'd like to be sitting on the john some more .
i reckon that bloody mark <UNK> is a <UNK> .
he can never make up his stupid mind .
' he 's such a poo - brain for sending that stuck up bitch <UNK> to that marriage forum today .
"like , real leaders should have names like john and george and <UNK> ."
<UNK> never changes his mind - he 's a real true blue bloke .
like when he said he did n't want a <UNK> .
"not like that dirty <UNK> mark <UNK> who 's a fence <UNK> , it 's so like un - american ."
"dubya is pretty cool too , but i do n't like it how my <UNK> calls him up all the time ."
<UNK> could be cool too - he should just join up with us like that nelson dude .
"he sticks to his guns too , like when he said i 'll never be a member of the liberal party ."
my <UNK> is on the phone to that <UNK> - brain george dubya again .
"he thinks he 's so special , but in reality , dubya is a <UNK> ."
"i mean , he does n't even have sexy eyebrows ."
"i mean , sure amanda <UNK> is <UNK> , but she 's got some good politics , not like that der - brain <UNK> ."
"although , he has got cool <UNK> this senate review into gay marriage is such a <UNK> ."
"i mean , it 's not as if we do n't know <UNK> poo - for - brains is n't going to agree to it anyway ."
"<UNK> said the funniest thing to dubya right now , he was all like ' hey , i 'm bob brown !"
i wish i could get closer to him to see how he ... thinks .
there are so many <UNK> out there for learning chinese .
he <UNK> in teaching chinese to english speaking adults using e - learning .
urllink <UNK> for a neat little flash card program for learning chinese <UNK> and <UNK> see urllink <UNK> - <UNK> .
there is a free <#> day limited <UNK> trial which will let you find out whether the flash card method is right for you .
"i was handed a french version of this <UNK> to nelson <UNK> , so i looked for the original version and urllink found it ."
our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate .
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .
"it is our light , not our darkness that most <UNK> us ."
"we ask ourselves , who am i to be brilliant , gorgeous , talented , fabulous ? actually , who are you not to be ?"
there is nothing enlightened about <UNK> so that other people wo n't feel insecure around you .
"we are all meant to shine , as children do ."
we were born to make <UNK> the glory of god that is within us .
it is not just in some of us ; it is in everyone .
"and as we let our own light shine , we <UNK> give other people permission to do the same ."
"as we are <UNK> from our own fear , our presence automatically <UNK> others ."
"i have <UNK> with the idea of starting a blog for some time , and i have <UNK> with the idea of learning chinese for some time too ."
yesterday afternoon the <#> ideas seemed to come together .
the <UNK> was a chance meeting with a young chinese woman on <UNK> ( you have heard about <UNK> have n't you ?
"if you have n't you might find it interesting see urllink <UNK> . """
"free <UNK> <UNK> that works "" and it does ."
") she was in "" <UNK> "" mode so i sent her a "" are you really there "" message ."
"after a couple of minutes i was ready to give up and sent a second "" too bad "" message when she replied with an <UNK> <UNK> ."
"for some reason i insisted , and asked if we could talk , she agreed and the conversation took off ."
i will call her wish in this blog because it is a slightly <UNK> version of her chinese name .
she says she tries to learn by playing english dvds but that she can not follow them at all .
"i am her first overseas contact , and she feels lucky and slightly awe struck to be talking with someone from so far away ."
and i have always enjoyed <UNK> new skills in willing <UNK> .
i encouraged her as she has low confidence in her ability to communicate in english .
she seems to have an electronic dictionary somewhere as occasionally i heard her <UNK> away looking to find words that she did not understand .
"<UNK> - a massive <UNK> force that seems to crush everything in its way <UNK> - a crude idol of <UNK> urllink <UNK> image , urllink idol ,"
<UNK> seem to be my boyfriend 's god ) what 's in a <UNK> ?
"not normal sized breasts , but the huge , almost ugly , <UNK> things ."
"the ones that penny 's , walmart and k mart will never carry a bra size to fit ."
my boyfriend of nearly <#> years has an obsession with these kinds of breasts .
he spends hours everyday searching the internet for pics and movies of women with huge <UNK> .
"now you will probably ask "" why do n't you just tell him that it hurts you ? """
<UNK> would have his hands full ( no pun here ) with this theory .
ok well that 's just gross any way you slice it .
"because of this ongoing problem , this <UNK> has <UNK> rolled right over me ."
the site of women with breasts larger than me makes me angry .
"if my boyfriend and i are out together and i see <#> of these women , i immediately feel threatened by them ."
i do n't even like for him to see me naked anymore because i feel like he is always comparing me to the pics he looks at everyday .
"he is aware of how i feel , i have told him what this has done to me ."
"i love this man with all of my heart , but he refuses to try to see what this is doing to me as a woman ."
his response to this rant will be anger and denial ...
"no surprise to me but i feel better for having "" dumped "" instead of "" stuffing "" ."
at least this blog is n't saved to the hard drive where i can pull it up again and again and <UNK> to it .
"well , its come to this . a place to ramble , piss and moan about the state of affairs ."
the first thing i will mention is the <UNK> events i have witnessed over the course of <#> years .
women have <UNK> because they can get pregnant again some other time .
the internet ... let me get started with that !
"it could have been a wonderful thing , but <UNK> started out as a way to share information and thought ..."
"it is <UNK> with <UNK> that suck the life out of relationships , businesses and the economy ."
i ca nt imagine anyone that has a computer at home that does nt use it to cheat in some way .
"those unhappy house wives that use it to create a perfect <UNK> world where they are all thin , blonde and single ."
businesses use it to cheat you out of your money and <UNK> use it to <UNK> the public .
"the days of <UNK> life , liberty and the pursuit of justice are a faded memory ."
patience and tolerance are a thing of the past .
"well , i have <UNK> plenty on the leap into the <UNK> ."
it 's monday and i just am having a hell of a time waking up !
"this weekend , we drove down to pine mountain , ga to meet <#> of my best friends and her family ."
i have n't seen her in just over a year - when i went down to help her when her baby was born ! ! !
"anyway ... driving down friday afternoon and evening , then a full day on sat ."
", followed by a full day on sunday and driving home.. well , i 'm a bit tired ."
"for those of you who may not know , our "" family "" vehicle is my <UNK> <UNK> - cab ."
and i do the vast majority of driving .
"hubby does n't drive to suit me most of the time , so i just drive !"
"lol do n't get me wrong , i love my truck , but our family has <UNK> it for road trips ."
i rode in the back seat for a few hours ...
omg ... it 's like a <UNK> church <UNK> !
hard as a rock on your butt and the back is straight up !
"<UNK> it was <#> of the <UNK> road trips we have taken in a while , but dang , the ride was tragic !"
there was a nasty accident on our way home and at least <#> person did n't make it .
"semi , motorcycle , jeep , and other vehicles ."
"so , praise god we made it safely ... and i mean that sincerely !"
"ok , we went over to the <UNK> gardens ."
you go in this glass <UNK> thing and it 's huge !
"of course , bc had to be dragged out kicking and screaming !"
lol we got to actually see <#> coming out of its <UNK> .
the grounds at this place were absolutely gorgeous !
it was like a little piece of heaven there in the middle of no where .
"we saw the victory garden south , so maybe they have a couple of places they go to to film , but this was definately <#> of them ."
"the hotel rooms were n't anything real special considering the price , but it was nice ."
"the kids actually enjoyed it , i think ."
"bc did for sure , and <UNK> , well , she seemed to enjoy it ."
"having my friend 's <#> <UNK> daughter there too , well that helped too ."
"yeah , she 's spread them out a bit ."
"but the older <#> helps a lot with the baby , so that 's good ."
"i 'm sure this seems very chaotic and <UNK> , but i warned you in the beginning that i was having a hard time waking up ."
i 'll try to put something better together soon !
"ok , yesterday we had a yard - sale ."
"we did ok , but had more left than we sold , so we decided it was time to just part with all the junk ."
"hubby loaded the stuff into the truck and we went to give it to the good - will . of <UNK> , bc had to go with us"
"he turns to me in tears , signing that we need our junk back !"
"put it back in the truck , he tells me <UNK> !"
"as i try to explain that we do not need this stuff anymore , he decided to change his tactics ."
"then he goes on to explain that we need to go to wal - mart and get new stuff , again ! now !"
god forbid we not have the house <UNK> at the <UNK> with junk ! ! !
"bless his heart , he was so <UNK> that we could not immediately replace all our junk ."
"lol that said , let 's address our <UNK> welfare and <UNK> systems ."
"then again , back then people took care of their "" own "" so to speak ."
"if a family in the church or community had a need , the church or community would step up and provide for that need ."
we do n't like to get that involved with people now .
"our society is more of a "" smile and say hi as you pass "" type now ."
"sure , we will sit here and say "" not me !"
"not us , we only help those who are not willing or able to help themselves ."
the stereo - type of people having more babies to get more money is true .
"but if you have a kid , well , who gives a care ?"
"whether of not you can care for those children properly , oh well ."
maybe by the time your kids start having kids you 'll get it right .
"yes , these types of people are allowed to <UNK> ."
"if you 're on welfare , no more kids until you are supporting yourself and the ones you have ."
we 'll help you get an education or training to enable you to get a job you want to do .
"if that job happens to be a low paying job , fine ."
"for those who do n't want to help themselves , fine ."
"well , i 'm gonna enjoy playing with this new toy for a while !"
"of course , there 's about <#> other things i could ( some would say "" should "" ) be doing"
"but hey , the dishes will still be there when i get thru here ... unfortunately ."
"speaking of dishes ... what is this "" domestic "" gene ?"
it must come along with the shopping gene because i sure as hell ai n't got it .
"ok , i think i 'm a pretty good mom , not the best maybe , but pretty darn good ."
"but since i do n't keep the <UNK> of homes , some people think that i must not be a good mom ."
"mind you , we do not have unwanted bugs or other creatures <UNK> around the house but we do have a lot of <UNK> ."
"* * ok , now i 've had to save this as a draft <#> times now"
"so if the timing seems a little odd , it 's ' cause i keep coming back and adding to it ."
"* * and who decided that when you get married and/or have children you have to like suddenly become a dull , boring , <UNK> ?"
"think back to your childhood ... that kid with the "" really cool "" parents"
"and they talked to you , not at you ."
"listen to yourself sometimes , which do you do most ?"
"i do not want to grow up if that means giving up "" my "" time or choosing boring chores over fun ."
"if that makes me <UNK> , so be it ."
"ok , i figured out how to post another entry ."
"it 's been an eventful summer , from way high to way , way low and very very long !"
the girl - child ( <UNK> ) went on <UNK> with the ex .
<#> week and she hated most of it .
"the step - mom got a new puppy . realized that the puppy ranked over the child ( and the ex too , for that matter ) ."
"she later went down to <UNK> to stay with the grandparents , and the ex some too ."
"was good for her , she got spoiled , as usual ."
"got the "" spend money like there 's no tomorrow "" gene , but not the shopping <#> ."
"but , when she came back , she lost her <UNK> mind !"
"had to have the cops come out the day b4 her b - day , nearly took her away ."
"at that point , it would have been ok with me ."
"hubby got to go for the 1st "" mini - <UNK> "" with out me and the kids ... lucky him ."
"of course , i 've had several of those , but this was his first ."
the bc is always good for a laugh .
"last night , the <UNK> gets a wild hair to sweep the back porch . as she <UNK> the patio table"
", she notices that the bc has collected a <UNK> of spiders !"
"so hubby goes to re - locate the awful mess and <UNK> that yes , it 's a bucket of spiders but they 're all dead !"
"so now , he 's not only finding and catching bugs , but he 's killing some of them on purpose !"
"where 's this gonna lead , i wonder ? ?"
"this past w/e , we 're working on the trees in our yard , <UNK> by recent storms ."
then he shakes his head and goes on looking for bugs .
""" where 's mom ? "" she asks ."
"she finds me and nearly screams "" what are you doing ? ?"
"? you 're gonna fall ! ! ! """
"when i assure her that i 'm safely <UNK> limbs , she decides she 's gonna give it a go ."
"man , you have to love the enthusiasm of youth ."
she took over and cut up about all there was to cut up there .
"so , i haul my big fat <UNK> of woman down to the earth again and take over the <UNK> i was made for , supervisor ! !"
lol guess this is enough to start .
"i found to my dismay that the <UNK> did not work , and then i found out that the roof was <UNK> !"
is it any wonder that president bush has so many followers ?
"forget the <UNK> dads and soccer moms , i’m talking about the paris hilton idiots ."
in a world where we are on the <UNK> of a worldwide holy <UNK> .
where are very lives are at stake each and every day .
"there was no other news in the entire nation , <UNK> rat dog rates front - page coverage ."
americans have the attention span of <UNK> out <#> year - old with add .
are these the family values we are seeking in america ?
what kills me is the number of people involved with this <UNK> .
"none of them had the balls to stand up and say , “"
who gives a rat ’s ass about paris and her <UNK> .
don’t we have something better to talk about ? ”
are we going to see <UNK> <UNK> cycle listed next to the <UNK> ?
today ’s a good day to wear panties for a change .
why don’t we just give her her own section in the paper ?
that way i can throw that section out along with all the other <UNK> and crap .
"if i find a smart , college educated democrat <UNK> by this <UNK> , i’m going to bitch slap them and demand their degree back ."
"i can’t wait for the whole world to just suddenly wake up and realize , “"
“ we will kill this <UNK> unless the american people stop sending us pictures of the blonde whore . ”
"gay republicans , i don’t know if <UNK> checked the history of the party , but i would expect to see rumsfeld on queer eye any time soon ."
gay republicans are about as effective as black <UNK> .
i saw <#> senator from georgia who founded a group called democrats for bush .
it makes about as much sense as having the oil companies write the environmental policy .
"he had <UNK> for america , and he visited a chapter in each state ."
i just think you should pick your group and stick with it .
"if you’re a jew for jesus , you’re a christian ."
"if your a republican lesbian for change , your dick cheney ’s daughter ."
if you’re a democrat for <UNK> <UNK> you work for <UNK> .
it happens each year there is an olympic games .
it ’s like the ultimate summer programming on television .
"they need to move up the election date though , because by the time november rolls around , i’m bent ."
"have all the conventions , the olympics , and then have the election on labor day . back to school with a new president ."
"all i know is , i am so invested in this election ."
"i am either going to party like <UNK> <UNK> on november 2nd , or i’m going to be making housing arrangements in toronto ."
"i think we could get more people to vote if we changed the process a little . give out <UNK> , put on a show something ."
"you walk into the booth , you pull the <UNK> , <UNK> go off , balloons drop , you’re the <UNK> voter , you just won a <#> bucks ."
you send in an <UNK> ballot and you’re automatically entered in the <UNK> ’s clearing house <UNK> .
maybe if we could bet on it in vegas .
you could sit in a chair across from <UNK> <UNK> and he’d ask you ; “
"you’re choice for president are john kerry , democrat , george bush , republican , or ralph nader , independent ."
"bush has been in office for <#> years , and he did make that tax cut which i’ll need if i win ."
"kerry is smarter , but he ’s long <UNK> and puts me to sleep ."
"george makes up funny words i don’t understand , and kerry uses real words i don’t understand ."
i’m going to have to use a <UNK> on this <#> <UNK> .
” maybe what we should do to increase voter turn out is send the <UNK> 's around with <UNK> .
they can make it to every door in america on just <#> saturday .
"i do believe this , if you don’t vote , you have no right to criticize ."
you have to sit back and shut up for <#> years .
you gave up your right when you couldn’t get off the couch .
we are free to openly critique our elected officials .
it ’s called freedom of speech and it is the reason our soldiers are fighting overseas .
freedom is the most important thing we have as american .
that is why i can not understand why we as americans can stand still when people ’s voice and freedoms are <UNK> on by others .
"i may not agree with you , but that ’s what makes america great ."
don <UNK> was <UNK> off the stage because he made some anti - bush remarks .
what kind of remarks would you expect from a guy who wrote hotel california ?
across the country artists are <UNK> and <UNK> because they <UNK> a different view then the president .
"when you <UNK> <UNK> to a <UNK> across the street , that ’s not freedom ."
"when you are arrested for wearing a tee - shirt that <UNK> the president , that is not freedom !"
"what gets me is that <#> years ago , every comic in the world made fun of clinton ."
nobody <UNK> <UNK> when he would <UNK> on bill for his entire <UNK> .
he didn’t send the police after the <UNK> calling for his <UNK> .
i just want to wake up in that america again .
i thought the new <UNK> was going to be this new <UNK> of wide open possibility .
if i had a time machine i would go back to the <UNK> and live them over and over again .
even if that does mean <#> more years of <UNK> and <UNK> .
sometimes i hope to wake up and have the last <#> years be just a dream .
i hope to wake up in the lincoln bedroom and find bill clinton in the shower tell me it was all just a dream .
i don’t know who my ideal candidate would be .
"since , all politics are run by special interest money i’d have to be flexible on that ."
can someone out there tell me the difference between special interest money and a <UNK> .
last time i checked it was illegal to <UNK> a public official .
a <UNK> was defined as the giving of cash or gifts to gain influence .
when did you america get the wool pulled over its eyes .
"to <UNK> , to give money or gifts to gain influence , see special interest groups ."
clinton had a lot of <UNK> in that closet and i loved him for it .
like i said i would rather talk about a presidential dick suck then war <UNK> .
why are all these candidates running away from their past anyway .
the people running the country for the next <#> years are going to be baby <UNK> .
we know all about the <#> ’s and <#> ’s .
"we know how much pot you smoked , how much coke you <UNK> ."
"my ideal candidate would have followed the dead for a summer , and dropped acid a dozen times ."
"because if there is anyone who has seen jesus and can think outside the box , it ’s him ."
just come right out and put everybody in their place .
baby <UNK> need to stop hiding in the shadows of <UNK> .
we saw what you did to yourselves during those decades .
"my generation invented <UNK> , you guys invented <UNK> ."
"we didn’t invent <UNK> , wife <UNK> , or the sexual revolution , that was the <UNK> ."
i’ve seen pictures of kerry and bush in leisure suits .
"oh sure , you guys took part in <#> <#> ’s fad , but not drugs and sex ."
"you’ll wear lime green <UNK> , but when it comes to a hand job in a disco , that ’s where you draw the line ."
president why didn’t you volunteer to go into combat ?
” admit that your votes are for sale .
i’ll bet if the <UNK> had raised a <#> dollars for bush he would have spoke to them .
"my candidate wouldn’t pussy foot around the issues , and he wouldn’t use political language ."
"that doesn’t mean i <UNK> dick cheney , but when he told a senator to go fuck himself , i had mad respect for him ."
millions of dollars are wasted each and every year on presidential campaigns .
kids in oregon lost <#> weeks of school because they were <#> <#> dollars short in their budget .
if either <#> calls themselves the education president they better not do it in oregon .
why can’t we do a national election on television ?
"boom it ’s done , it ’s over , and it doesn’t cost americans half a <#> dollars ."
that ’s how much this election is going to cost .
do you have any idea what you can do with <#> <#> dollars .
you could buy <#> court side seats next to jack <UNK> and have money left over for parking .
you could buy oprah ’s garage for that much money .
"what i don’t understand is that the job only pays <#> <#> a year , before taxes ."
and apparently a blow job isn’t <#> of the <UNK> .
i would rather campaign for a- rod ’s job .
"<#> <#> a year , and <UNK> is included ."
"it would have to be a small <#> , so <UNK> , watch your ass ."
americans are smart . or at least we were .
i’ve seen a few episodes of <UNK> that <UNK> that statement .
they would have to have a plan to reduce the need for even having a middle east .
"we can walk on the surface of the moon , but we can’t get more than <#> miles to the gallon ."
"do realize for the price of <#> war , we could fully fund the development of a new gas free car ."
we could ignore them like red - headed <UNK> .
my candidate would have to believe in technology and education .
i sick of <UNK> things down for my generation .
"dave <UNK> got a <#> <#> dollar deal with comedy central , a soldier in iraq makes <#> a month ."
"britney spears makes a <#> <#> a year , a teacher makes <#> a year ."
is it any wonder that we need a <#> new nurses and <UNK> this year alone .
"what ’s more important to america , the latest boy band or your children ’s education ."
"seeing as how we spend a <#> <#> dollars a year on justin <UNK> alone , i think we know the answer ."
my candidate would have to have the right priorities .
"education first , boy bands and britney last ."
"the smarter we are , the easier it us for us to realize that christina <UNK> is <UNK> ."
smart people recognize that paris hilton is a <UNK> .
"smart people invented <UNK> , so they could get it for free ."
"if i have to take a test to drive a car , they should take a test to run the country ."
"if i have to have a <UNK> degree to be in the management program at blockbuster , the president should have at least a <UNK> ."
"you have to pass an exam to practice law , but you don’t to make law ..."
you would think america would want the smartest man possible for the job .
he would make every other candidate look like dan <UNK> .
we voted for a vice - president who couldn’t spell potato .
"we <UNK> don’t care if our president has good grammar , just that he can speak good ."
"if you got that joke , count yourself among the smart people ."
if you didn’t well ... i’ll bet you can tell me when friends comes on .
why can’t we have an iq requirement for our commander - in - chief .
"we’ve got an age requirement , a <UNK> requirement , but when it comes to brains , a c - average will do ."
"and i don’t want just book smart either , but common sense smart as well ."
too many smart folk lack the common sense to tie their own shoes .
"but i want a president who knows if we’re attacked by an enemy in afghanistan , we don’t invade iraq ."
i want a guy who knows how to eat a <UNK> .
"after florida , i think we can all agree that the voting process needs to be changed ."
"since america is run by corporations , why not hold an election like a corporation ."
"the more taxes you pay , the more votes you get ."
let ’s see the rich folk bitch about their taxes now . here ’s how it would work .
each <UNK> would get a vote based on how much taxes they paid .
"people like you and me , we’d get <#> because we paid a third of our income in taxes ."
"people like teresa heinz - kerry , <UNK> get <#> , because she paid ten percent in taxes ."
"now if you want a bigger vote , give more to your country ."
quit trying to dodge your <UNK> duty of paying taxes .
it ’s <#> of the things that <UNK> me about america .
in fact the word duty and taxes are <UNK> .
yet every single <#> of us try to avoid that duty like a whore with <UNK> .
"if taxes were the draft , we’d all be canadians ."
i’m like a jew at an <UNK> meeting when it comes to taxes .
"we all want to pay less , but bitch when the country is falling apart ."
"i going to pay my taxes with pride , because iraq needs schools too ."
to me taxes should be like a toll road .
"you don’t pay your fair share , you don’t get to use america ."
"corporations that hide their <UNK> in a strip mall in the <UNK> , should only be allowed to business in the <UNK> ."
"if <UNK> <UNK> there customer support to india , i should be able to pay my phone bill in <UNK> ."
"if you want to participate in america , then you have use americans ."
"and when i say americans , i don’t mean just the white folk who have been here for <#> generations ."
"unless your name is dances with <UNK> card , we were all immigrants once ."
isn’t it about time we stopped placing blame on illegal immigrants .
"we are so worried about them coming over here and taking american jobs , but we’re totally okay with sending our jobs directly to them ."
"in my plan , the more taxes you pay , the more vote you have ."
"the more service you give to the country , the more you get to participate ."
"and when i say service , i mean all manner of service ."
building homes for the homeless is just as important as serving in the military .
you don’t have to be <UNK> party lines to be a patriotic american .
you can serve by giving back to the community .
we would be better off if we did a little nation building here at home .
"see what happens , i voted for the guy who i thought was funnier , and nothing ..."
"remember when you <UNK> at the news , not <UNK> in disgust ."
i would much rather hear about some getting blown then blown up .
how long ago was it that our biggest problem was a stain on a blue dress .
"if you want to pass an amendment to the constitution , pass <#> that will allow him to be president again ."
i was reading that they are going to make a movie out of his <UNK> .
they described it as west wing meets american pie .
"we love him so much , we’ll <UNK> his wife too ."
just so we can get him back in the white house .
i got to believe that bill would have found a way out of the current situation and gotten head at the same time .
i would take bill and all his faults over bush any day !
people say they are glad bush is in office .
"they searched me , an elderly lady in a wheelchair , and a <#> year old little girl with a hello kitty backpack ."
"we know because he makes more videos than <UNK> , and they’re all <UNK> afghanistan ."
"do you think when we decided to send over a <#> <#> troops to iraq , osama went ( sigh ) “"
i guess i fooled them when i turned right .
” it ’s mistakes like that upset me .
"i don’t like making funny of the president , and i don’t draw party lines when it comes down to making fun of somebody ."
i even voted for bush because i figured with his lack of speaking skills he would be good for material .
we’ve got a <#> <UNK> dollar <UNK> in the budget .
"really if he just shows up , kisses a few babies , the country can run itself ."
"to be honest i never figured he would win , and neither did the majority of americans that didn’t vote for him ."
i didn’t even factor in the whole florida thing .
who ’s more likely to do something funny bush or gore .
"sometimes i lay in bed at night , can’t sleep ."
i feel like this whole mess is my fault .
if i wasn’t so <UNK> with who ’s funnier we’d have a different world .
i would have voted for gore if i thought he would have <UNK> an <UNK> .
"now he ’s <UNK> gore , pissed off al ."
his speech at the democratic convention should have come with <UNK> .
"( <UNK> shot ) thank you boston , i’ll be here all week , try the <UNK> ."
"he had hot daughters , but i figured the bush twins are more likely to get drunk and give me more material , so vote for bush ."
"that would be the only thing that could get me to vote for bush , if his daughter did some hot girls gone wild video ."
then i would want to keep them around for <#> more years .
"see , i’m willing to sacrifice the good of the country for a good <UNK> joke ."
apparently bush and cheney do n't like people who do n't like them .
"in order to attend a cheney rally , <#> had to sign a urllink loyalty <UNK> ."
i 'm not sure if it was to george bush or <UNK> .
i don’t know why anybody would want the job of president .
"especially these guys , they are all multi - uber - <UNK> . and"
they’re applying for a <UNK> dollar a year job . not a <#> - to - <#> job either .
when you break it down that ’s like <#> dollars an hour after taxes .
no wonder the president is always being told what to do by someone else .
"if i were getting paid that little , i would act like middle management ."
<UNK> out a <#> on the nose every day .
"i’ll take care of the budget on monday ... ” for <#> bucks an hour , who wants the pressure ?"
"if you are going to be president of something , be the first ."
how hard was washington ’s first state of the union speech .
"“ well , we’ve been a union for about a week now , and ..."
well ... that ’s about the state of it .
"i think that we can all rest easy , now that we’ve gotten rid of a <UNK> . still looking for those <UNK> of mass destruction ."
i think that if i were president i would go mad with power .
"i think they all have , even washington . “"
"no , to hell with that , i want a district ."
"i don’t even know what a district is , but i want it ."
"my <UNK> right there , <UNK> into the mountain ."
"not any <UNK> , i want the biggest , <UNK> , cock of a <UNK> you can find . ”"
the only candidate i can respect right now is john edwards .
he knows what it ’s like to be poor .
"ten - dollar wedding band , couldn’t afford the hotel room on his <UNK> , went to wendy ’s to celebrate ."
<UNK> little brother is in trouble with the law .
apparently he is a <UNK> alcoholic who ’s been arrested <#> times for <UNK> .
"a southern politician with an alcoholic brother , who says he ’s not ready to be president ."
none of the other guys knows what it ’s like to be broke ass poor .
when was the last time cheney prayed he had more than <#> dollars in an atm just so he could take something out ?
when was the last time rumsfeld knew <#> different ways to prepare top <UNK> ?
has bush ever answered the phone in a different voice because he was trying to avoid a <UNK> ?
last time i checked the us was a few <UNK> in debt .
i would pick up the phone and pretend i was someone else . “
"” next time i call the white house , <UNK> better pick up . “"
i am not knowing where he is right now .
i truly believe that you can not understand a man until you have walked in his shoes .
"so in order to promote harmony among the races and classes , i suggest that we have rich white slaves ."
it be great to make dick cheney <UNK> some cotton ?
“ i said <UNK> that cotton cheney ! ”
"( whip sound , cheney suddenly turns into a southern field slave )"
"yes sir boss , <UNK> gonna <UNK> dat cotton ."
"all the good republican field hands working on the land singing good <UNK> white people <UNK> , without rhythm ."
the black masters could take ann <UNK> out to the shed and have their way with her .
"her new book would be titled , “ the myth is true , how ann <UNK> became a democrat ."
the only problem would be bush is so stupid he’d
keep digging a hole trying to find the underground <UNK> .
today ’s headline ... “ bush asks blacks to review allegiance to democrats ”
that ’s the equivalent of having your salad tossed in prison and then asked to pay for it .
the republican party wants the black vote . really ? and the <UNK> is now accepting jews ... when i first saw this i couldn’t believe it .
i thought it was a <UNK> to a <UNK> cartoon .
after researching the story i couldn’t believe my ears .
every fox news <UNK> was <UNK> gop - black relations .
i was curious what relationship were they talking about .
he loved black people so much that he led the charge at ole miss to give blacks their own <UNK> .
his own <UNK> was far too <UNK> with white people .
blacks would be better off with their own .
he wanted to give blacks an extra paid <UNK> by voting against martin luther king jr .
of course they could have been talking about <UNK> <UNK> .
he so loved black people that he gave them his only <UNK> son .
maybe <UNK> was <UNK> his own record on relations with blacks ?
he loves them so much he wanted to keep <UNK> of them out of that florida voting mess .
what have the democrats done to deserve the black vote ?
"civil rights , <UNK> rights , they may have given blacks the right to vote , that doesn’t mean they have to vote democrat ."
"according to such gop <UNK> , like david duke , jimmy the greek , jerry <UNK> , this will only hurt black people ."
so what have the democrats done to deserve <#> % of the black vote ?
"maybe it ’s because when you enter republican and black into a google search , you get the web page of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i don’t know about you , but that kind of relationship with the <UNK> has always made black voters a little <UNK> ."
maybe black voters like democrats because of the difference between clinton and bush .
bush thinks <UNK> <UNK> are well - <UNK> golf courses .
bush is the first president in <#> years not to speak to the <UNK> .
we all know how well blacks were treated <#> years ago . or as trent <UNK> called them “ the good <UNK> days ” .
"bush asked the urban league if the democrats deserve their vote , after he begged for their vote himself ."
i expected less <UNK> and more of a laugh track .
you’ll see how much bush loves black people when the bush daughters are caught on girls gone wild getting butt naked and freaky with <UNK> .
<#> of the big issues for this election is family values .
america needs to return to good <UNK> family values .
"who wants an irish , mexican jew raised by a gay chinese and a black lesbian . that ’s my family , and even i don’t want those values ."
i don’t know anybody who wants a coke habit and <#> <UNK> <UNK> in their family .
the bush family has been arrested more times than larry <UNK> .
the only reason he wants to ban gay marriages is because he ’s too cheap to pay for his daughter ’s wedding .
my cousin invited me to my first gay wedding .
"when the reception comes , we’re all going to take off our shirts and start dancing anyway ."
"i told him that dick cheney is from <UNK> , i don’t think they are too <UNK> of gays in <UNK> ."
"well on the <UNK> it said , ‘ welcome to bear <UNK> ”"
"<#> gay guys want to get married , knock yourself out ."
"<#> lesbians want to get married , doesn’t hurt my fantasy , i’m just in the corner watching anyway ."
i don’t think i could be the minister at a lesbian wedding .
” let ’s just look at the rich man ’s idea of family values .
not when you send the kids to boarding school and have the <UNK> take care them .
not when you consider that <#> % of the people who frequent <UNK> are married men .
only a man with money can afford a <UNK> .
no poor man alive can talk a whore into taking a <UNK> check .
the average “ <UNK> ” cost $ <#> an hour .
the only people i know who can afford that price are republicans and charlie <UNK> .
i know we’re not talking about charlie ’s family values .
those are the last words an altar boy hears .
"most poor people don’t have credit cards , most rich people do ."
most on - line porn sites and phone sex numbers take credit cards .
but who wants to live in a ‘ leave it to <UNK> world .
"if we all came to terms with our <UNK> behavior , pot and <UNK> would be legal , and we’d all be happy ."
"i’d like to dedicate these next jokes to a true patriot , someone who truly cares deeply about this country and is trying to help , michael moore ."
is anyone going to come see my blog ?
every morning i take the same road to work .
"<UNK> said ) a city that used to be rural many years ago , and still has a few "" country "" looking areas left ."
"try to find them in my living and driving areas , and make sure i choose those <UNK> rather than heavily <UNK> <UNK> ."
"there are still some left , but they are <UNK> rapidly ."
on this little <UNK> - long road things are changing .
"it was on several acres of <UNK> land , full of palm and other types of trees ."
it had been there for at least <#> years - that 's my guess .
all kinds of birds and wild <UNK> <UNK> the trees there .
"<#> morning a couple of weeks ago , i saw the <UNK> ."
"a sign had been planted out by the road "" coming soon ! !"
"another piece of the old , <UNK> times gone ."
"i bet the problem was that the original owner did n't make much money , and could n't make necessary <UNK> to the old house ."
"but , since land prices here are going sky high - your house can be worth $ <#> ."
"so he sold to the evil <UNK> developers , tucked tail and ran ."
"his neighbors across the street , still living on the same types of property and in older homes , are <UNK> their thin <UNK> , perhaps ."
"thinking , "" gotta get outta here "" ."
"homes - and the idiots that buy them and , unfortunately , <UNK> them . and"
"with the new owners , come the new ideals ."
<UNK> must be <UNK> and bushes well trained and <UNK> .
no room for birds or <UNK> to hide .
to be replaced by the usual <UNK> and <UNK> .
"i need to move to montana , except i 'm scared of the snow ."
so i 'm leaving my honorable error up in the title .....
"there 's a pity factor there , i just know there is ."
i may change the name though - or not .
we 'll be chasing this stuff down right down to the very last second before school starts !
"the guys are working their <UNK> off , but right now for every work order they sign off , there are <#> new ones !"
exciting work continues toward our goal of a managed network ...
"we are excited about all the tools and hardware , in typical geek fashion ."
"better get to setting up some more email accounts and then catch a couple <UNK> 's ... on to tomorrow , when we 'll do it all again !"
finally got the email off to all the people that were nice enough to let me practice on with their email accounts with the <UNK> list .
"well , am at work at my night job , so will have to get back to it ."
will post again later when i get home ( if i can keep my eyes open ! )
found out from greg that my blog is blocked by <UNK> at school ....
"i know it can be fixed , but i have to find the time and the info to do it ."
"<UNK> cleaned up the last of <UNK> , then came over to get stuff that needed to be moved from hi ."
i was working on getting the <UNK> at hi hooked up and <UNK> as necessary .
all that 's left over there is the lab and grades <#> and <#> .
"craig was working <UNK> and took a machine over to nv for me .... seems that we are doing ok hitting the high spots , so far ."
"personally , ca n't wait till next week to see them on the field again ...."
i know it will be awesome ! ! !
it is n't me with the time lol .
i wish i did but it seems my day is busy with kids and other things .
i do not sleep well at night so it makes the days that much harder .
i have been busy with the kids this week though so that is fun .
monday i had to go pick up a new bus with <#> other drivers .
it was quite awesome driving down the highway there were <#> buses in front of me and <#> behind .... really awesome sight .
the rest of the week has been playing with kids and having fun and by evening i am just tired and do n't want to do anything lol .
"tomorrow we will pack up the <UNK> , air beds and other equipment and go camping for the weekend ."
i will try to keep equipment down to a minimum .
things are not looking good for back to work .
we will find out by august <UNK> if we are even going back to work for the 7th or not .
that would be about all the whining i can fit in for now . not much else for good news .
hmmm funny thing is i do n't remember this week much lol .
i worked sunday and got home at <#> am .
sleep was short as i had to babysit in the morning .
i had to go into work to get a uniform . when we got home
the kids went out to play and i just rested for a little while .
"tuesday , susan had school in the morning ."
and when jordan and i got home i had a rest while she played video games .
then out to get susan and the kids went outside again for the afternoon .
i got more work tuesday evening and did n't get in till almost <#> am .
wednesday i went to pick jordan and susan up at 8:30 am and went to the school .
they were in the northern part of lake <UNK> ( i think that is how you spell it lol ) .
he had n't thought about turning on his cell phone ever .
we went to the zoo and spent <#> hours there .
jordan had hurt her neck so she was resting it .
i got a call from work they need me saturday .
i am still a bit tired and catching up .
"tomorrow i am taking a <UNK> to the blue <UNK> game , i am looking forward to it but still a bit nervous too ."
when i got home i took all the camping gear out of the van .
now i was hoping to not have to do that because it is a lot of work lifting the stuff up the stairs down the hall into the apartment .
i had to take the <UNK> seats out of elizabeth 's room after <UNK> all the cat hair off them .
"then i rested for awhile , turns out i could have rested for another hour but we wo n't go there lol ."
i had to drop susan off with the <UNK> and then go to work .
i got there and found out from my work sheets that my report time was <UNK> not <UNK> there is a big difference there .
i checked my bus and took my time doing so
but i could n't for the life of me figure out how to get the axe <UNK> .
camp <UNK> is camp strictly for jewish kids and we took them to a roller <UNK> in another city <#> hour and <#> min away .
i went in the roller <UNK> to check it out and i could n't move from bodies everywhere lol
so i went back out and we went to tim <UNK> to hang out .
i was done work about <UNK> and got in bed about <UNK> .
today i go pick up my neighbour in <UNK> .
i do n't have to be there till bout <UNK>
so i have a bit of time to fill in ...
"nothing else is planned for today , perhaps i can sleep lol ."
"it was ok , i made good time coming back and went into work to sign the <UNK> sheets ."
after that i went to pick up susan at michelle 's house .
we had coffee together and i hung out for about <#> hours .
"i spent <#> hour and <#> minutes on the phone with welfare , can we say boring ? ?"
there is so much paper work to get a hold of .
they want so much crap from me ugh .
i got a call from my friend <UNK> today and i phoned her back and she invited me for supper tomorrow so that is really exciting too .
just another thing to look forward too in my week .
i am also going to a baseball game tomorrow .
it is bus drivers against office staff .... should be a good time and a chance to meet other employees from where i work .
i have no money and today i get a call to come to work .
also will be getting jordan back starting monday .
monday will be a free day cuz michelle will be watching susan .
i will make money for the rest of the week .
i do n't have to worry about money now ...
i am tired and it is only <UNK> pm i still have to do a load of wash .
"i will get up and do that now . then play with the kids , they want to watch a movie ."
i had a good sleep last night which is remarkable because of the way i feel .
i almost feel sick to my stomach with worry but i do that a lot anyway but think this time i am justified in worrying .
i am going to attempt to apply for welfare .
i have to swallow my pride though as i have <#> children to provide for .
my neighbour goes to visit the father of her baby there .
what a lovely weekend for her and her <#> children .
she really is in love with this guy and hopes that he gets out soon but in the mean time they go see him every <#> weeks .
they stay in a trailer behind not <#> but <#> <UNK> wire <UNK> .
oh well not my place to say anything .
well i should get off and get my van ready for this family .
"sigh , i really do n't want to do this run but she pays me well to do it ."
"i just got word that i required <#> + hours to claim unemployment , i got <UNK> in the last year ."
there is no work for me right now as i do n't even have <#> year of driving experience under my belt .
i pray that i make it through the next month till i get back to work .
however i think it would be a good idea to create a resume with my current abilities on there .
i may or may not come in handy .... <UNK> .
i was out this morning to take my <UNK> to the school is cool program put on by the early years learning centre .
i had to attend a parents info meeting so that was fun .
the kid 's mom is at a job interview .
"i am really praying she gets this job , she really needs it ."
"if she does , i will have to be there to help her out $ $ $ so this would be good for both of us right now ."
my baby is going on a sleep over tonight and she is so excited .
she is going to my friend michelle 's house ( the <#> on the job interview right now ) .
i am going to stay home and read lol .
i do n't get to read much with both kids here so that will be nice .
i actually need to get working on my car seat articles ...
i have some written i just need to find them so i can post them at urllink <UNK> oh ya speaking of ....
oh ya i am whining about not having money .
lol just makes me sad to see a baby and know my baby days are over .
tonight i am wondering what is wrong with people .
to me some things just do n't bloody matter .
my friend came to me tonight feeling sad and upset and <UNK> so .
what <UNK> me is people who complain about the <UNK> things and ca n't see beyond their own noses .
it is lucky for these people that <#> can not just reach into the monitor and choke the living shit out of them like homer would do to <UNK> .
there was a time when i was just an angry person and i thought i had nothing positive about me .
my friends have taken the time to show me what good things i can do .
the internet is my way of escaping from the patch .
just an hour ago i could hear the fireworks going off just as they do every wednesday and saturday throughout the summer .
it is a quiet town really and nothing dangerous ever happens .
we have some crazy drivers but what town does n't .
it is almost bed time and time to settle in for the night .
"my <UNK> susan has to go to school tomorrow , she has assured me that she will wake up lol ."
this is going to be about my boring life in the patch .
i do n't sky dive or jump from tall buildings .
i drive some people crazy with my endless stats and pushing for laws .
finally got the law to <#> years and <#> lbs starting next month .
i tend to enjoy that though so we wo n't go there lol .
"more about me i am a mom , i am good at that job although i wonder if i am being tested at times and i fail the test ."
i have <#> girls they are the loves of my life .
my oldest is <#> and the younger <#> is <#> .
"i have <#> cats , a <UNK> and a <UNK> ."
both are fixed but sometimes i think they are broken lol cuz they do gross things .
i drive a school bus but now i have my air brake <UNK> so i am happy that i can drive anything but a <UNK> trailer now .
another great urllink article by max <UNK> .
"neither the issue of drug abuse , nor the issue of terrorism can be resolved that way ."
this a classic libertarian <UNK> urllink question the government and its motives at all times . especially in times like these
"on this , i am <#> % with the <UNK> ."
our laws are not <UNK> when it comes to <UNK> our courts can <UNK> out a punishment severe enough to match the crime .
<UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> for blowing up the <UNK> building in oklahoma city .
those responsible for the <#> attack on the <UNK> are <UNK> for life .
thus we need not worry about the guilty not being punished .
"that may <UNK> but anyone can be fooled , military authorities included ."
and it is your own safety you are protecting by demanding that all executive authorities operate within the scope of the law .
may no <#> have to live through that horror and learn what they had learned about what <UNK> government agents with a <UNK> can do !
"this urllink site offers an interesting perspective on islam , it seems ."
there are some interesting references and descriptions of urllink osama bin laden and some prominent muslim <UNK> ' urllink take on acts of terrorism .
this urllink blog post presents a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> bush approval ratings and the terror <UNK> on a time chart .
"while i do not claim that terror <UNK> where specifically <UNK> , i think the data in the <UNK> is definitely worth a look ."
there 's little i would like to say here other than raise the same issues she is attempting to raise .
"on tuesday , july <#> , <#> , judge <UNK> <UNK> made a decision and ruled on my case ."
"under his ruling , i , an american citizen , am not entitled to pursue my 1st and 5th amendment rights guaranteed under the constitution of the united states ."
"the vague reasoning <UNK> , without any explanation , is to protect "" certain <UNK> relations for national security . """
judge <UNK> reached this decision after sitting on this case with no activity for almost <#> years .
"he arrived at this decision without allowing my attorney and i any due process : no status hearing , no <UNK> , no oral argument , and no discovery ."
is this the american system of justice we believe in ?
it is also worth <UNK> that for some reason attorney general john <UNK> seems to now be in a position to impose restrictions on the congress .
that is a situation which is almost <UNK> to a total <UNK> of the executive power .
under this broken system the attorney general of the united states is being allowed to <UNK> gag the united states congress regarding my case .
"and even worse , the united states congress is readily <UNK> with this illegal gag ."
i only think it is wrong to think of <UNK> <UNK> ' case as only a case involving <#> individual .
it it of crucial <UNK> and its outcome may seriously affect the direction in which this society is going to move .
"i am not religious , so i do n't fear hell , at least not <UNK> ."
"however , i do believe in the existence of morals , and their importance for the living ."
i believe that there is no such thing as <UNK> .
"<UNK> , in my opinion , is merely <#> of the many courses of action available to us ."
and we are responsible for our <UNK> and that includes <UNK> .
urllink all the more reason to question the <UNK> of the recent execution videos .
"i have watched a few , most look <UNK> at least to <UNK> <UNK> the nick berg video . to learn"
more about nick berg 's death and many suspicious circumstances surrounding it see urllink this link and many others .
i am not offering any theories of my own on what happened to the unfortunate mr <UNK> i simply do not have enough information to go on .
"however , i suspect that the tape of his execution is a fake ."
many people around the world have conducted expert <UNK> of that video and they also have serious doubts as to its <UNK> .
"just <#> <UNK> note how much various <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , and how they <UNK> with time and adjust to changing circumstances ."
"however , a verbal <UNK> only goes so far ."
i think some action is in order here .
i believe the lawyers as a profession must take a stand and <UNK> those administration lawyers from the legal profession .
"i believe that not only emotionally and morally , but also <UNK> this would be the right course of action ."
i believe lawyers acting that way must be prevented from ever practicing law again .
political <UNK> is a common tool involved in the process of <UNK> .
<#> side tries to dig up all the dirt it can on their opponents who in most cases respond in kind .
provided the information used is not <UNK> <UNK> that is normal <UNK> even though it does at times get ugly .
"however , the latest string of attacks on the prominent democrats ' war records is beyond <UNK> and , in many cases , is in fact <UNK> ."
it is also worth mentioning the <UNK> campaign <UNK> against former urllink senator max <UNK> .
<UNK> lost <#> limbs in an accident during a routine <UNK> mission where he was about to drink beer with friends .
he saw a <UNK> on the ground and picked it up .
"in fact , <UNK> could have dropped a <UNK> on his foot as a national <UNK> – or what <UNK> <UNK> calls "" weekend warriors ."
""" luckily for <UNK> 's political career and current <UNK> about bush , he happened to do it while in vietnam ."
"well , by both the official criteria and those <UNK> by common sense she is wrong ."
and i doubt she is not aware of that .
<UNK> was wounded in an area that on that day had been <UNK> by the enemy .
that area was officially <UNK> battlefield on that day .
"however , as this occurred during combat , this sort of injury is officially viewed as a combat wound ."
his silver star and bronze star <UNK> to that .
that makes what <UNK> is saying all the more <UNK> .
that ad ran during urllink <UNK> <UNK> 's senate election bid against <UNK> .
"i do n't know for a fact that urllink <UNK> davis is on to something , but she surely acts it ."
i tend to look at her version of events a little <UNK> .
"be it as it may , there are still many questions about what truly went down in <UNK> on april <#> , <#> ."
if i were to state <#> reason why it is perfectly legitimate to question the official version of the events i would state the following .
the tape recording from a camera located across the street from where <UNK> parked the famous <UNK> truck is still not available for public viewing .
keep in <UNK> all we are talking about is a view of a public street in the middle of a major us city .
there are many laws and regulations that control our daily activities .
"however , we should not forget that there is a document upon which they are based and to which they must <UNK> namely , the us constitution ."
"apparently , the fbi has recently <UNK> a urllink <UNK> designed to aid the law enforcement officers in <UNK> potential terrorists ."
"among other things it lists a person 's <UNK> to "" make numerous references to us constitution "" as an indication that the person may be inclined towards terrorism ."
"<#> <#> hand , there are <UNK> who wrap their <UNK> agenda in the us constitution ."
"however , every <UNK> ideology , secular or religious , has also been used for the same purpose ."
"but we do not see the <UNK> <UNK> police officers that christians , muslims , <UNK> or <UNK> must automatically be viewed as terrorist <UNK> ."
nor does the <UNK> suggest that everyone wearing jeans must be viewed with <UNK> even though terrorists have been known to so dress .
"i believe that knowing the constitution is a <UNK> no , scratch that , a responsibility of every citizen ."
"<UNK> it , especially when dealing with a law enforcement officer , is also an <UNK> right ."
i am not <#> % sure how the urllink data was obtained .
"on the <#> hand , millions of jews already live outside israel ."
maybe it is indeed time to address the issue of the ideology mr <UNK> is talking about .
i do n't fully agree with the urllink article on some points .
"i fully believe that developing alternative fuel technologies is a matter of life and death , a matter of survival ."
"that should not stop us for , as thomas <UNK> correctly <UNK> , any system based on the use of <UNK> resources is <UNK> ."
"well , i surely had a good laugh reading this urllink article ."
the link above is to the urllink document <UNK> <UNK> by osama bin laden to present his case for fighting the us .
professor <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> of the man who later became our president adds a new and interesting urllink perspective to what we know about that man .
"i do not want to get into the partisan politics , or those of class , however , sometimes i can not help it ."
""" it is most certainly true that of the roughly <#> % of today 's us voters who support bush some qualify to be called poor ."
"i do not want to try and <UNK> to those people whom to support , what to think , or how to live their lives ."
i think the urllink assessment of the us as an empire is to a large extent correct .
"it is not an empire in classical sense , not like the roman empire where the emperor had an almost unlimited power and was appointed pretty much for life ."
"however , the us foreign policy is much akin to that of an empire ."
"do n't exactly know <UNK> maybe , because i grew up in the <UNK> but the very idea of an empire makes me <UNK> ."
"i think it is very important for the us to work towards becoming just "" power like many other "" as opposed to a hyper power ."
it is just that people and states are <UNK> and none should have the temptation of being <UNK> .
do n't quite know why i am posting this .
this is just an excellent summary on what went on in that prison .
once again it is too bad that the major media reported only a small part of the story and tried to spare us many <UNK> details .
"i 'm only writing a short blog today ... its late in the day , and i 'm out of time ."
"first , i had a nice evening with c last night ."
he 's an interesting character and we always have a good conversation .
"i guess its part of having shared some of the same experience as professional musicians , and now we 're just government <UNK> ."
he showed me some pictures of a couple of <UNK> we did and it brought back lots of memories .
he 's a good player and a good guy and it was a pleasure playing together .
i get stressed and frustrated being around the house and its good to get out with friends .
i got a call from t today - he 's looking at buying a <#> foot <UNK> .
he 's as big a dreamer as i am .
he 's considering selling his house and living on the boat - i guess its a pretty common sentiment among men of a certain age .
<#> thing interesting about blogs and such is that you have confirmation that everyone is equally messed up in their own sweet way .
"the only difference is that some people 's lives are more messed up , because they ca n't seem to control it ."
"i suppose , from that point of view , i 'm lucky , because my life is fine - but it was n't always that way ."
<#> thing i 've got going for me is discipline - i can make myself do things i do n't want to do .
its always a balance that you never can <UNK> .
i suppose some of it is if you listen with your heart or with your head ( and which <#> ! ) .
that 's largely a personality thing and its beyond an individual 's control .
that 's what makes life interesting - everyone is different .
"you would n't really want to live on a planet with everyone the same as you , would you - i sure would n't !"
"the challenge is that everything changes constantly , so just when you think you 've got it figured out , the rules change .... interesting ."
my objective is to try to stay loose and not get to stressed about what 's <UNK> .
remember no <#> gets out alive so have some fun in the meantime !
"i eagerly check my blog several times during the day , expecting some nasty remark or words of encouragement ."
perhaps my faithful readers feel intimidated by my writing <UNK> or feel that their mere words would not do justice to my <UNK> <UNK> .
here are a few sample comments you may wish to consider using .
""" what a self - <UNK> asshole you are !"
do you honestly think anyone cares ? ? ? ? ! !
""" people like you are what 's wrong with this world ! """
"the above are merely suggestions , feel free to <UNK> your own ."
"today , i had a big meeting ( as they 're called ) with the <UNK> regarding some work i 'll be doing ."
"it was an easy sell , as they 're all real estate types and understood what i was talking about ."
"i managed to get a bunch of stuff off my desk today , which always feels good ."
things tend to pile up easily and sometimes i have to run my ass off to get stuff moving .
"mostly , i do n't like to be rushed and i prefer having the time to consider things rather than having to dash off an immediate response ."
"i usually find that other things come to mind over time , which help me to <UNK> a better response ."
"something is wrong with the "" good "" computer at home now ."
the old computer bit the dust last week and now the new <#> is acting strange .
"i 'm getting tired of doing the maintenance on them , as i never use them and am not responsible for maintaining them ."
maybe its time they <UNK> .... i 'm getting tired of it .
tonight i want to write up the songs we 're doing for the 20th .
i 've also got to go to <UNK> tire and pick up some parts for the boat tonight ( see yesterday 's post ) .
"the <UNK> <UNK> came last night and took the <UNK> , so he can order the materials ."
i told him to get it done before school starts - he assured me he would -
these <UNK> guys seem like a funny lot .
he 's my second choice as the first guy proved to be even less reliable .
"i 'm planning on moving it next year and doing less cruising anyway , but it will be harder to sell if fuel prices go up ."
i 'm planning on buying something more fuel - efficient eventually anyway .
i 'm back from my very nice weekend .
"judging by the huge numbers of comments received ( <#> ) , i 'm sure that many people are waiting with <UNK> breath , to know all the details ."
"of course - its a <UNK> self - <UNK> , what is n't ?"
"everyone is looking out for their own asses in some way , shape or form ."
"even doing what is "" right "" at great personal cost , is ultimately selfish , in that its what you think you should do ."
now that i 've justified my <UNK> self - <UNK> to my own satisfaction ( and that 's all that matters to me ) - here ya go !
"ah , the weekend .... friday night we <UNK> at g 's place and came up with a name for our <UNK> ."
"how does , "" sound check "" sound ?"
its not easy coming up with a name that is suitable .
"its fun brain <UNK> for names , but they 've gotta work to ."
"my <UNK> were , "" the <UNK> boys "" and "" hack - job "" , but i realized that they might not work in some situations ."
i 'm feeling pretty good about the music ( classic hits stuff ) and i think we 'll do okay on the 20th .
"g is pretty experienced , as i am , so its pretty well a <UNK> if i can remember the arrangements !"
"saturday , i worked on the kitchen <UNK> and made pretty good progress ."
i 'm really sick of the mess the house is in and i ca n't wait to finish this .
"its only been <#> weeks , but its pretty hard to live in a construction site ."
"as i get older and more <UNK> , i find my tolerance for disorder and chaos in my personal environment less <UNK> ."
"i can see myself at <#> , if i live that long - i 'll be the <UNK> old bastard you 've ever met !"
saturday night we went to n 's place for dinner and he showed me how to cook his wonderful indian <UNK> .
it was fun to learn how to prepare the delicious dishes .
"n is a very patient and <UNK> individual , so he makes the process of learning almost as fun as eating the results !"
his daughter l was home and she <UNK> a and a and also played the piano beautifully for us .
i 've always been a big fan of l 's and it was nice that she stayed home and visited with us .
they just got back from <#> weeks in england and had a great time .
n showed us his excellent photos - truly a man of many talents !
"sunday , i went to the boat and did some work on it ( installing storage <UNK> , etc ... )"
"they just bought a boat to , although its a fair bit smaller ( <#> feet ) ."
"they were impressed with the marina and they 're considering putting their boat in there , as its easier than <UNK> it all the time ."
"i think they would have enjoyed going out for a cruise , but the weather did n't look promising , so i elected not to go out ."
i 'm very safety <UNK> on the boat and i 'm not about to take chances with anyone 's life or my beautiful boat .
"i did however move the boat in the marina and handled it pretty well , i must say !"
i 'm still learning how to handle it and i 've got a lot to learn .
"i discovered a small leak in <#> of the <UNK> <UNK> , when i was doing my inspection of the engine ."
"i believe in <UNK> maintenance , particularly when i can be far from land in the boat and far from help if it <UNK> problems ."
"its no big deal doing the work , but it <UNK> me that i tried to prevent just such a problem and now i have to deal with this ."
"the lesson here is to trust my own judgement and not listen to the "" experts "" ."
today we 're having the <UNK> and <UNK> done in the kitchen .
"this will help us get back to normal , as we 've been doing the dishes in the bathroom sink - what a pain !"
"hopefully , after today , we can put things back together in the kitchen ."
"the only outstanding items at this point are the <UNK> , <UNK> and some painting ."
"the <UNK> <UNK> is to come tonight and take his <UNK> , and i 'm hoping the <UNK> can be installed in the next couple of weeks ."
we 're getting <UNK> <UNK> and i 've designed a pattern of white and blue <UNK> which will compliment the rest of the pieces .
"i need to get to work , as its <UNK> up as i indulge in my <UNK> fantasy <#> more time !"
feel free to comment on what an interesting life i lead and what a swell guy i must be .
any negative comments about what a <UNK> asshole i am can be direct to <UNK> .
", there remains real work to be done ."
"i 'm glad its friday ! this time of year , its hard to work , because i 'd much rather be on vacation ."
summers are so short and precious in <UNK> that you want to make the most of them .
"the temperature has dropped lately , and its already cool at nights ( <#> degrees ) ."
its nice for sleeping but its an <UNK> of things to come - <UNK> ! tonight i 've got a rehearsal for my gig on the 20th .
"i 'm not really looking forward to the gig , because its right when i 'd like to be on holiday on my boat ."
there are only a few good weeks left in the summer and i do n't like to loose <#> of them .
"i 'd rather gig in september , but we have to do this to get there -"
i 've <UNK> so often that its not much of a thrill anymore - its just something that i like to do .
it feels comfortable and natural - like a job you enjoy .
"tomorrow , i 'm going to do the electrical work for the kitchen <UNK> ."
i 've got to wire up some <UNK> and lights .
"tomorrow night , we 're going for dinner at n 's place which should be fun ."
i 'm going <UNK> - i 'm looking forward to that .
"here 's a link to an interesting article about iraqi "" <UNK> "" . and"
some people still think it was about <UNK> the iraqis .
this morning we got our new kitchen <UNK> installed - they are excellent !
urllink these are pictures of <UNK> which is an amazing pre - <UNK> site on the <UNK> side of mexico .
those handsome dudes are my brother ben and i. visiting <UNK> was <#> of the high - lights of my vacation in mexico in february <#> .
"when we visited <UNK> , it was toward the end of a hot afternoon ."
the breeze off the <UNK> was refreshing and we went for a swim in the small <UNK> to cool off .
the ocean side of <UNK> is all a cliff except for the small <UNK> which is a white - sand beach .
this <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> when he came along on his <UNK> mission .
get to see planes and <UNK> through the wide - eyed stare of my little boy .
i can never be completely honest in this blog .
"so far it is anonymous , but eventually my ego will cave and i will want someone i know to read it ."
that means all the tall tales that have <UNK> put in the <UNK> shall not be revealed as of yet .
it also means that deep down i will want to write something cool as opposed to something real .
"just the back of her hand , not the fingers or anything ."
"her position was <UNK> , but with legs <UNK> , as if she was jumping off a diving board to perform for a drunken crowd ."
"she would leave as soon as she woke up , he knew it ."
her scattered clothes were almost set up perfectly so she could dress without breaking <UNK> .
"even her kate <UNK> sat right next to his apartment door , <UNK> <UNK> , waiting to be <UNK> with <UNK> a cheek kiss ."
her voice would fade as the elevator door closed .
he thinks there is a sandwich in the fridge . or a glass of water .
words i read in a book i just started to read .
written within the first <#> pages of the book .
"enough to make me love writing for a <UNK> , and then it was back to envy , and <UNK> <UNK> about my own ability to form sentences ."
"that echo in my mouth , in my <UNK> <UNK> , making me wish i could use them in a conversation ."
will try not to get too lit as monday morning horror stories are not fun .
"they are fun when you are talking about someone else , just not about you ."
"lost <UNK> , even while <UNK> a bottle of <UNK> <UNK> and a chocolate chip cookie ."
i drink about <#> - <#> <UNK> of water a day .
this makes me pee every <#> - <#> minutes .
i am becoming the master of the <#> - handed hold and shake as i take my water bottle in with me .
should i be writing more than a diary .
should i start a story and write it every thursday ?
should i wax poetic about secret <UNK> and potential <UNK> - like <UNK> ?
i surely do not want to be writing about pee and weight and water all the time .
although i swear i could read her mind as if she had closed <UNK> on her parking lot sized forehead .
it was a nice gesture and after almost <#> years we still find a comfortable level of conversation .
"it was nice to see him , even if he did make out with my wife years ago ."
i had a <UNK> last night and it was good .
they will then <UNK> and ask when i am making them a salad hee ho <UNK> dee fucking <UNK> .
they then walk way with their <UNK> container of tasty <UNK> goodies <UNK> in their sausage like fingers .
that was too bitter as i am in a pretty awesome mood .
"looked at my body naked today and while still bowling <UNK> , the hips are down and the cock looks bigger ( only because my stomach is smaller ) ."
"my son is not sleeping well , and is stealing away from whatever time we have to ourselves ."
"but c'mon , when he makes fun of things , laughter <UNK> , so no hidden resentment ."
"extra horny these days , do n't know why specifically , but i seek out <UNK> women to walk behind on subway <UNK> ."
just for the brief <#> step <UNK> sway that <UNK> a small fire beneath the <UNK> .
<#> and feels like my <UNK> is that of a teenager .
"i am a fat , button popping <UNK> ."
tomorrow better be better not as bitter and no wet peanut butter .
i have been home all week caring for my boy .
i love it and all but i am going a little stir crazy as my wife has been attending to her social affairs all week .
he needs some mother time as he tends to ask about her less as the time goes on .
they all were out last night <UNK> it up without me .
my social life has changed since becoming a father .
but it sometimes feels like i am missing something .
maybe i will just pop up to the local pub for a couple of pity <UNK> tonight .
"oh <UNK> , i mind as well write everyday ."
"i will probably write to look cool though , hopefully allowing some random <UNK> to drop in and think "" hey this guy is cool "" ."
why do i worry about shit like that ?
i feel somewhat light today even though i had an ice cream cone last night . and a bag of <UNK> that i did not tell steph about .
"i want to go out tonight , but i am with <UNK> as steph had made plans before me ."
somewhere i am happy that i am forced to stay home and <UNK> my <#> year old .
"i have pot so after he <UNK> out i can perhaps indulge in my <#> favourite <UNK> , pot and porn , and <UNK> pleasures ."
so i do have something to look forward too .
i have no idea if i will actually start to write a blog .
the idea of writing everyday is somewhat soothing .
well ... i am unsure how to start this new blogging stuff ... guess i will just reflect a little and see how it goes .
"it was like being in a <UNK> , suspended time <UNK> during the early part of my adult life ."
that shouldn’t happen to anyone ... and shouldn’t have happen to me .
no friends ... no job ... and not much family to speak of .
i had to make money and take care of my son ...
i couldn’t afford to live on my own so me and my child stayed with my parents ...
i went back to school and learned a <UNK> . then ... tried for years and years to make a difference ...
be somebody and amount to something for my sons sake ... the matrix i was in got <UNK> and harder to escape from ...
"my parents , my employer , so called friends , relatives ...."
i had a vision of the way i wanted my life and it wasn’t happening .
feeling like every move i made no matter how positive only <UNK> those around me to throw dirt on my emotions and <UNK> and even me .
... i would try and try to ignore and endure .
so much time had gone by in this <UNK> ...
buried in the <UNK> and gum of this matrix <UNK> - <UNK> structure ...
i got really mad <#> day and more or less threw my hands up in <UNK> ...
i suddenly broke free from the matrix by <UNK> right then and there ... that i was going to make a move .
a move that would change my life and those that went with me for the better .
i had gotten to the point where i hated everyone around me ...
i had to get out or die trying ...
in a way i was <UNK> ... a new beginning ... a time to be me and a very <UNK> change ...
"every winter i <UNK> over the seed <UNK> , thinking of spring when i can <UNK> the tiny <UNK> into the freshly <UNK> soil ."
"i think of my <UNK> in the back , where i labor late at night , starting the seeds under artificial lights to give them a head start ."
"so that 's why i 'm at the <UNK> , surfing for plant porn ."
whatever is gorgeous and <UNK> goes onto my little wagon .
the <#> where the buds must be <UNK> every third day ?
the beautiful ones that require daily <UNK> and root <UNK> ?
"full sun , part sun , sandy soil , whatever , its all the same to me ."
i buy it and put it in the ground .
"thus , i am responsible for the <UNK> death of a wide variety of <UNK> ."
i enjoy their <UNK> beauty and then <UNK> the <UNK> remains into the yard waste bin .
( i have also enjoyed the slow death of many an <UNK> <UNK> .
i have a friend who was convinced that i have <UNK> <#> for a year when in reality it was an ever - changing cast .
"honestly , do you take a <UNK> to dinner and a movie ?"
i just want to look at the <UNK> while they last . and
i have a friend who brings paint chips to flower shows to <UNK> <UNK> with other <UNK> to get the exact shade of flower .
"( he 's <UNK> than a <UNK> of <UNK> , as if that was n't clear ) ."
"i <UNK> in the <UNK> , a women 's only <UNK> ."
this <#> was extra special as my mom extended a visit to see me race .
"i have never been at a more pro - woman , incredible event in my life ."
"last year was my first , and i was hooked ."
"the race is a <#> mile swim , a <#> mile bike ride , a <#> mile run ."
"but more than that , it is a chance for the women to shine ."
seattle 's race is the largest event in the country .
the sheer <UNK> - if i may be allowed such a word - is <UNK> .
"also , to see the thousands of volunteers and supporters ."
"boyfriends , husbands , kids , friends , parents all come out to cheer in a way i 've never seen at any other sporting event ."
just lots of homemade signs for mom or grandma or sue or <UNK> .
"the oldest participants were <#> - <#> of those ladies never did anything athletic until last year , when she did her first <UNK> at <#> ."
i was also running near some <UNK> - old girls and not a few cancer <UNK> .
( the race raises money for breast cancer ) .
"i 'm not a naturally athletic person myself - but in this kind of company , how could i not be inspired ?"
<UNK> to the few loyal members of my writing group ! as promised
"after much <UNK> , i have decided on <UNK> as my blog name ."
"i wish i could come up with a fantastic story behind it , but it is pretty mundane ."
"<UNK> and alone , i took to eating <UNK> <UNK> until i had enough sticks to built a small <UNK> of the new seattle library on my desk ."
inspiration came in the form of <#> small hungry children .
"occasionally , i make the <UNK> error of asking my <#> - year - old and <#> - year - old what they would like for dinner ."
their responses are <UNK> in both their creativity and their lack of <UNK> value .
"i do n't know why i 'm expecting them to say "" <UNK> vegetables "" or "" <UNK> chicken . """
"when i make the gentle suggestion of several <UNK> choices , their tiny faces <UNK> with despair ."
"i suppose this is like telling someone they 've won a fantastic vacation anywhere they choose in the world , as long as its <UNK> ."
"after several more minutes of whining , <UNK> , crying , etc ."
", i simply announce , "" fine , i guess we 'll just have spider soup . """
"after the look of horror passes , they quickly come around , <UNK> me that <UNK> and brown rice would be simply fantastic ."
"i guess that 's about as good a portrait of my <UNK> as any , the fact that my kids actually believe i 'd serve them such a dish ."
"but hey , i 'm not above using any tool at my <UNK> to get the job done ."
"i 'm not exactly coming from a position of strength , what with the <UNK> stick structures and all ."
<#> <UNK> km ) bike followed immediately by <#> mile on the treadmill .
i also went to <UNK> for my back again .
"when i started running more often , my back started acting up <UNK> i already mention that ? )"
"today , i <UNK> to work and after work i swam for <#> <UNK> <#> m , i think ) followed immediately by my ride home ."
i wore the <UNK> while swimming to get used to it .
<#> of the members at the gym told me that i could borrow her <UNK> .
she is doing the <UNK> canada in <#> <UNK> ! ! )
"so , i am going to try out her suit in the lake next week , and hopefully it fits ! !"
"tomorrow , i have a wedding to go to , so no <UNK> ."
this is not <UNK> related but it is fitness related .
"i recieved a phone call this morning , and was told that i was referred to the organization as a possible trainer to teach the <UNK> course ! !"
? that opens a few more career doors to me .
"well , my first <UNK> is in <#> days ! ! !"
i am doing the <UNK> distance at lake <UNK> .
i am so excited and nervous at the same time .
i love being able to tell people that i am training for a <UNK> because it amazes the shit out of everyone and it makes me feel really good .
i started training about <#> weeks <UNK> think ) .
"at that point , i had n't swam laps in about <#> years ."
the last time i did laps was for my bronze <UNK> in swimming when i was <#> yrs old .
i also had n't ran in a long time either . since my <UNK> was born <#> yrs ago
", i have had issues with my deep core muscles as well as my it band and <UNK> <UNK> that made it painful to run ."
"the good news is that i now can run <#> <UNK> minutes on the treadmill ) , <UNK> <UNK> , and cycle <#> km ."
"i did try a couple of brick <UNK> this past week : on saturday , i <UNK> <#> km followed immediately by <#> mile of running ."
i did n't realize that i had months of brick <UNK> under my belt already lol .
"yesterday , i <UNK> <#> km followed immediately by <#> minutes of swimming ."
", last night was my last weight training session before my <UNK> ."
i have been doing a full body weight workout <#> - <#> x week the last couple of months .
today is a well deserved and needed day off .
"i received a call today from m * * * * , who is <#> of the <UNK> technical <UNK> ."
"( we at the help desk are <UNK> as well , so i do n't hold that against him . )"
he had just completed replacing a hard drive and re - <UNK> a user 's pc and was calling for a windows password <UNK> .
""" is the user signing into the <UNK> or into the nt domain ? """
""" what ? "" i had to ask the question again and could tell things were n't going to be going well ."
m * * * * * told me that it was for the domain so i asked him to put the user on
so i could do the standard identity <UNK> with the user and <UNK> the password . except that the user did not have an account on the domain .
"it 's not unusual but , as it was a <UNK> password issue on a newly installed pc , it really should have been his responsibility to set up ."
except that he did n't know how to <UNK> as the administrator .
"oh , he knew that you entered an administrator password but did n't know what was . """
"do n't you need to know the administrator password to re - image the pc ? "" apparently not ."
we at the help desk have access to the <UNK> that <UNK> the administrator <UNK> .
"technically , we 're not supposed to have it but since we are required to <UNK> user 's <UNK> , we have to have the <UNK> ."
"* * give me the <UNK> , read it back to him and then plug the name into the <UNK> ."
"it 's pretty complex with upper case , lower case , numbers and special characters"
"so i carefully talk him through it again , using the standard <UNK> ."
i can tell he 's having problems because he 's calling from a cell phone and trying to type <#> handed .
"that 's all well and good , but the password contained a percent sign ."
putting the caps lock on and hitting the % key actually enters a <#> .
he solved that problem by having the user type .
we fixed that and it still was n't working .
after more frustrating attempts i read the <UNK> to him .
i read it to him <UNK> and realize that what he had agreed was correct twice was n't actually correct .
"so , i feed the correct name into the <UNK> and get another password . which does n't work ."
everything that he could do wrong he did do wrong .
he was going to have to contact network services .
i was surprised that he had n't locked the administrator account .
i carefully read off each character of the password <UNK> and had him type each <#> as i read it and . . .
"now this whole , process took nearly <#> minutes on me reading the password off to him and him typing it in again and again ."
"i mean , i do this stuff all the time ."
"so , why do n't i have his job ?"
"being a major bank , that means that half the jobs that i might apply for are probably <UNK> with or clients of the bank ."
"as i was walking from work to where i park my bike , i was approaching a couple walking in the other direction ."
i was long past looking like a high school geek
so i was curious about what <UNK> he had .
"just as he past me , he said , "" yo , man ."
i was n't disturbed that this guy might not have understood the logic of doing such a thing .
"after all , he probably had n't ridden a bicycle since he was in school and certainly did n't commute to work on <#> ."
"no , what bothered me is that he felt compelled to ask the question of a stranger walking down the street ."
"was this some low - <UNK> <UNK> thing to impress his girlfriend ? """
"yo , look at that dork with all that bike stuff and no bike . """
"yesterday , our users started getting e - mails with a subject line of "" price "" ."
"this , of course , was a new virus : urllink <UNK> ."
<#> saving grace is that the bank uses <UNK> notes for their e - mail .
in my <#> years of watching viruses coming through our e - mail program i have never seen <#> successfully <UNK> the notes address book .
"microsoft outlook might spread it 's legs wide and say "" rape me with your <UNK> and worms "" but , so far , notes has been <UNK> ."
"of course , we still get an increasing call volume at the help desk from users who tried to open the attachment ."
i have to open a ticket to send to second level support .
"about an hour into yesterday 's virus <UNK> , i got a call from k * * in notes support ."
"she was letting us know there was a problem . """
"we 're the first to find out when users do things they should n't . """
she <UNK> that the virus was <UNK> the user 's personal address book and i said that i <UNK> it .
"she looked at the <UNK> information for a number of e - mails and they all said <UNK> , which meant it was all coming from outside ."
customer <UNK> was being informed and they would be sending an e - mail out to all users warning them not to open the previous infected e - mail .
the real joy was going to be tuesday morning .
there was a queue as soon as i logged into the phone with all the expected virus issues .
the bank has its system set up to automatically update the user 's virus definitions when they become available .
user 's do n't even have to go through the server 's login script .
"at least , that 's how it 's supposed to work ."
"as with every virus <UNK> we 've had , <UNK> reveals that a number of <UNK> do not get their definitions updated as they should ."
some for as long as a year and a half ( when their machines were installed ) .
it 's a good thing notes is as <UNK> as it is .
"as of noon i have taken <#> calls , which is about the number i get on a normal day ."
"oh , and another thing . . . ."
"so , here management is specifically telling us to <UNK> and dodge the user 's direct questions ."
i 'm not going to lie to these people .
i 've been receiving this sort of crap on <#> of my accounts for quite some time .
"since that did n't work , i felt that i had nothing to loose by using the link at the bottom of their email that <UNK> to <UNK> me ."
"that , of course , did n't work either ."
i asked for the director of marketing and was <UNK> to a line that never answered .
"eventually i was disconnected and called back , this time asking to speak with someone in customer service ."
the person there tried to re - direct my call back to the person whose responsibility it was to take care of these things .
i was n't disconnected as before and the person in customer service took my e - mail address and assured me that it would be removed from the list .
"again , the <UNK> directed me to a number that never answered ."
i got back on with him and he said the director of marketing was in a meeting .
"( if he knew he was in a meeting , why did he direct my call to a phone that he knew would n't be answered ? )"
i was unwilling to leave my e - mail address again because that only succeeded in getting me more trash .
"tuesday , i forgot to take the phone number with me to work and so when i got home i called ."
the re - direct to the director of marketing never answered and again i did n't want to leave my e - mail address .
the <UNK> directed me to another mystery number when disconnected me .
"i called back , this time asking to be connected with someone in customer service ."
<UNK> in customer service wanted to take my e - mail address
"<UNK> said she could n't do that and , with panic starting to rise in her voice , said "" do you want me to loose my job . """
"could i speak with your supervisor , please . """
""" i do n't have a supervisor . """
""" you are working completely <UNK> . . . . """
so i called back and asked to speak with someone on the executive staff .
the <UNK> <UNK> saying that he could not connect me unless i give him a name .
""" is this the person who called earlier ? "" "" if you mean the person that has been hung up on <#> times already . . . """
""" <UNK> left the room crying because of you ."
""" "" who am i speaking with right now ? "" "" just <#> moment , "" and the <UNK> put me on hold ."
"when he returned , he refused to give me his name ."
* click * i called up again .
""" <UNK> direct , how may i direct your call . """
""" yes , i 'd like to . . . """
"of course , this was all just a waste of time ."
a search of the web makes it pretty clear that <UNK> direct has a long history of <UNK> customers .
i 'm sure their staff are experienced in giving people the run - around .
look at urllink <UNK> am i sorry i made <UNK> cry ?
she works in customer service and i 've been in that boat .
the first thing you do when someone asks to speak to your supervisor is give them to your supervisor .
the claim that you do n't have a supervisor is a <UNK> attempt to avoid dealing with someone .
i am cursed with an <UNK> sense of justice and feel that criminals like <UNK> direct should be made to pay for their crimes .
"unfortunately , even the federal trade commission seems unable to exact the proper punishment on these people ."
"i know , i have n't posted in a few days ( like anyone cares but me ! ) ."
"tonight , though , i have been working on spanish notes trying to get ready for the new <UNK> ."
mike <UNK> me and told me that dennis had been in an accident .
"he 's ok , and the truck is still <UNK> ."
but i am not sure about what really happened .
it 's about time for me to go home .
it is still hard to believe that my baby is all but grown up !
"i think he has had a good birthday , too ."
today we all met at becky 's house for a birthday lunch .
we made <UNK> and mexican rice and baked him a chocolate cake .
"dennis and i ( mostly dennis ) got him an <UNK> guitar , i got him some <UNK> books , becky and john got him a new ( used )"
"<UNK> for his electric guitar that has special features on it , and <UNK> gave him $ <#> ."
plus john got his car on the road and mike got to drive it briefly .
"dennis and i had a wonderful weekend , too ."
"friday night we just watched some movies at home , and cooked on the grill ."
"saturday , as i said , mike took off , so dennis and i had the day ."
when we got back into <UNK> we went to <UNK> 's for lunch and sat for a while just talking .
we headed back home to do some <UNK> and yard work .
we made it as far as to pick the remaining green beans from the garden and walk over to the next door neighbors to give it to them .
russ offered dennis a beer and you can about guess the rest !
"we all sat talking for about and hour or more , until i finally said i had to get my shower to get ready for our dinner that night ."
and that 's where i found him <#> minutes later when i came back !
"it was a wonderful day , i have n't laughed as much or as hard in more time that i can remember ."
only <#> things in this life are truly difficult to live with - boredom and loneliness .
boredom generally goes hand in hand with lack of <UNK> and purpose .
most of the same questions can be asked when you are alone .
and i have been in a room full of people and felt utterly alone .
"- i mean truly share it with - is pointless , empty , and hollow ."
but my life does not <UNK> on just <#> person .
"when i say he is number <#> in my life , dennis is number <#> , the center of my <UNK> ."
"not that long ago , my children where , and should have been , number <#> , but that is no longer needed or appropriate ."
"not only my center , but my best friend and he keeps me grounded , focused , and happy ."
"of course , though , next come my children , <UNK> and my son - in - law ."
"i am so proud of them all , and they have just barely begun their lives !"
"she could have so easily sat back and let herself became a welfare mother , but she refuses and continues to be the best she can be !"
i am so glad to see him finally happy and acting like a semi - normal teenage boy .
"<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , kevin , <UNK> and eric , mike and <UNK> , even sally , for that matter !"
how do i explain what it means to me to do something so simple that other people seem to take for granted ?
"not only do i never have to be alone or lonely , i have purpose in my life ."
"granted , not every day do i have wonderfully important things to do ."
"especially right now , often i wake in the morning and wonder why i should get out of my bed ."
it is a waiting thing ... and it is a summer thing .
"yes , right now it is extremely boring due to lack of people on campus during the summer ."
"i love the <UNK> , the discussion , the exchange of ideas ."
this coming semester is going to be a tough <#> . working <#> hours a week plus taking <#> credit hours ( <#> classes ) will not be easy .
"spanish ii , math , and <#> computer classes ."
all of them will be lots of work outside class .
"usually i have at least <#> class that i can bs my way through - mostly theory type classes , for example my <UNK> class and the history class ."
all of my classes this <UNK> will be long hours of reading and work at the computer .
but i can not wait for it to start !
"ok , these ramblings have been going on long enough for tonight . later !"
yesterday i spent the day cleaning house and watching sappy movies on the lifetime movie channel .
"actually i watch <#> that was pretty good , but the rest were just sappy ."
"i did n't go anywhere , do anything , was barely on the computer at all ."
i have been dizzy and light headed all day .
"i went in for physical therapy , but did n't finish it all ."
"when i got home , in the mail i found the letter from <UNK> finally ."
i do n't have a problem with that at all .
i am happy that i am no longer disabled !
i want to be able to take care of myself .
i ca n't get any straight answers out of the ss department about what the bottom line of my status is .
the paperwork sent me today said that i was a possible <UNK> for continued benefits under the <#> program .
but in another place it said that i am <UNK> for <UNK> under the <#> program .
i went in to talk to someone about it .
no <#> can tell me for sure if i will have an <UNK> in benefits or not .
i have to know and <UNK> to provide <UNK> so i can have my <UNK> <UNK> and apply for food <UNK> .
i had to deal with aaron 's about causing my bank account to <UNK> .
"he as was a total asshole , but eventually i made him understand that i could n't afford the $ <#> in <UNK> fees for their mistake ."
"so he <UNK> my account ( my aaron 's account , not my bank account ) with $ <#> ."
"of course , although that means i have n't got to make but a $ <#> payment next month , it does me absolutely no good now ."
my account is <UNK> by $ <#> and it will take most if not all of my paycheck on thursday to put me back into the black .
which will leave me with nothing to live on for the next <#> weeks .
"and beth was not in the office today , so i could n't get anything done about it ."
"and i was able to get my books for next semester , plus some basic supplies for both me and michael ."
and i still have plenty of credit left to go back and get whatever i or michael might still need .
so i had to get it back apart and set the old <#> back up .
i also <UNK> that the thing has a horrible <UNK> smell to it .
i cleaned it as well as i could with some wood <UNK> .
the guys leave at 9:00 and i am here alone from then until <UNK> .
"my web site is looking pretty good , i think ."
"i still have my "" kathy and the <UNK> "" story and "" choices "" story to put in , and an "" about me "" page ."
but i have n't got those stories ready yet .
"i might work on <#> of them tonight . then again , i might not ."
<#> hour and <#> minutes into the shift and not a single call .
"i will try not to complain , but it is difficult ...."
"and we spent <#> hours up at <UNK> 's , then took home supper and sat at home with mike - a quiet evening at home ."
"then friday , <UNK> , mike , amber and i ( and of course , <UNK> ) spent the day at the mall ."
then that evening they went to <UNK> 's and dennis and
we sat up at <UNK> 's again - i won $ <#> playing ship <UNK> and crew !
"the he took me to eat at <UNK> 's , and the to see i , robot ."
"he was so tired , though , he slept through the whole movie ."
"saturday , though , he did n't have to work at all - first day off in about <#> weeks !"
we drove up to <UNK> and he got new glasses and we went to the mall .
he bought me an outfit to wear to <UNK> and eric 's wedding next month .
"then we came back into town , relaxed a while then went to kevin and <UNK> 's for supper ."
it was so nice to spend some time with dennis .
the house is so quiet without him home .
"i have a money problem - <UNK> took out twice as much as they were supposed to from my checking account , causing me to <UNK> ."
"now not only am i <UNK> by $ <#> , i have no money for the week except the $ <#> and change i have in my pocket ."
i really am not good at yelling at people !
"oh , what a <UNK> night it was ! long and boring at work , very little to do ."
then an even longer night at home alone in bed .
at least not for more than an hour or so at a time .
"up and down , tossing and turning , dreaming <UNK> dreams , reaching for the <UNK> ."
"but now , at least the long night is over , and i can head back home to my family and friends ."
"messed up her ankle pretty bad , but she will not go to the doctor and have <UNK> 's comp take care of it for her ."
she ca n't - without risk of losing her job .
"the idiot smoked pot the other night , and of course they will require a pee test ."
"considering her boyfriend went through the same thing less than a year ago , you would think she 'd have learned and stayed away from the stuff ."
"of course , though , the <UNK> of youth is that ' it ca n't happen to me ' ."
"as usual , i have n't a clue what i am doing , but of course that does n't stop me even for a moment !"
"i love writing , but i do n't do it often enough ."
"maybe , if i can figure out all this blog business , this will be a way to get it done !"
"wow , i 'm here , i think to myself ."
so this is what it 's like to write to no <#> .
finally i can write <UNK> and no <#> will complain about the message size limit in their email box .
"well , i guess i can relieve some tension built up by tonight 's visitor to my door - [ insert drum roll ."
"he thinks the government has planted bugs everywhere , even on my front porch in my harmless little <UNK> ."
"he has never had a fair shake in life , rotten parents , no education , you know the type ."
"i was <#> when i met him , and he was my dream guy !"
"in other words , he was everything mom and dad warned me about !"
"* sigh * <#> years and <#> kids later , i now pity him from the bottom of my heart ."
"( yep , that was another <#> of his umm ... stories ) ."
"i think that is what it all <UNK> down to , and that is why i pity him the most ."
what is left when you have lost all hope ?
"yet , i will sit and listen to his <UNK> <UNK> , because i think i might be the only person he talks to ."
"we have n't ever really gotten along well since those golden days of new , first love ."
"i think it was inevitable that we would not last , but a know - it - all teenager like i was refused to see the inevitable ."
"what has lasted is my tolerance and understanding of him , and i do n't think anyone else could do it ."
"if i even dared suggest he seek <UNK> help , he would n't listen ."
"not only would he not listen , he would never speak to me again ."
"he is a sad soul with no peace in his tortured mind , and no hope left ."
"i think he still needs me , <#> years later , even if he would <UNK> deny that ."
"for our kids ' sake , i pray that his broken mind will find some kind of peace ."
"until then , he 's got me to listen to him !"
are you called to short - term missions ?
i work for a church in a north dallas ( tx ) <UNK> and help <UNK> trips to fascinating places all over the world .
"i have , however , always had a passion for people in other countries and <UNK> to travel to bring the word of god to them ."
"last year i had the privilege to speak on the streets of <UNK> , <UNK> and to a men 's prayer gathering in <UNK> <UNK> , mexico ."
the desire i held in my heart was brought to <UNK> a couple of months ago when i was transferred to our short - term missions department .
"i am preparing for a trip later this month - again to <UNK> , but this time we will also spend a few days in beautiful <UNK> <UNK> ."
"in november i will be going to the <UNK> , egypt and then to mexico city in december ."
god places in each <#> of us gifts and abilities .
"and for many of us , he also <UNK> a special desire and willingness to use those gifts and abilities in a foreign country ."
"if so , pray for an open door to explore the wonder of his will there ."
short - term missions are a way to test the waters .
are you called to be a <UNK> somewhere ?
"or , to use your gifts and abilities on a short - term assignment ."
can you do without the creature <UNK> of home ?
do you hold up well in an environment of change ?
"the second amazing thing is that he is , indeed , already there ."
the third amazing thing is that language is not that big of an obstacle when you are on a well - planned short - term mission trip .
"yes , you will not be able to carry on a conversation like you might like but that is actually a good thing ."
"with language out of the way , the only thing you can communicate is the love of christ ."
"it shows in your smile , in your work , in the way you carry yourself ."
the first day we were painting it was our team and a couple of teachers from the school .
by the end of the evening some other parents had joined in . by the middle of the next day
"an entire army of parents , students and neighbors had joined us , many of them bringing their own <UNK> paint <UNK> from home ."
we were the <UNK> that <UNK> a team effort to complete a very large task .
even if you only go once on such a trip i encourage you to go .
<UNK> - forget the <UNK> and wide smiles at recent high - profile <UNK> attended by united states president george w. bush and european leaders .
<#> p.m. <UNK> - associated press evidence of overwhelming and <UNK> fraud in the ralph nader for president <UNK> was released today by the service employees international union .
“ we can’t have him flying off the handle at the slightest <UNK> but we also need a president who is alert mentally . ”
right now i am planning of moving and trying to step up a little into the world with god 's help of course .
i need to move out before my son comes back home from his summer vacation with his dad .
i also want to welcome him home with a few gifts and a few cool friends of his .
"i m kinda nervous since he does n't get along with his <UNK> , which i do nt blame him at all ."
"well , "" oh well "" , like they say ."
my boy comes 1st b4 anyone or any man !
i know that someday my son is going to look back and thank me for it !
it 's been almost <#> long years that i have waited for this man to change .
"i have given him my all , i have put my world on hold for his butt !"
"i have stood my him in his worst of times , not his family , not his friends , but me !"
his wife ! the worst part of this whole thing is that he does n't appreciate me nor the things i 've done for him thru out the years .
i have given my all to this ' so called marriage '
"i have nothing to show for , i gained absolutely <UNK> !"
if anything i have never been so miserable in <UNK> !
i use to be an outgoing person and not to mention a very healthy <#> mentally and physically .
"i am so depressed , so tired all the time and i have never suffered from so many <UNK> headaches b4 in my entire life !"
he is so complicated and hard to get along with .
he is <UNK> and has a temper that makes <UNK> <UNK> .
i am the type and kind that loves to live and be in peace and harmony .
"i would never pass it on to my future children nor anyone , since it deeply could be so <UNK> to someone 's life in <UNK> ."
"but the point is , if anyone out there , is going thru something similar , do something ."
"it 's been heard for me to get any kind of help or support , since i have no family at all , none whatsoever ."
i do nt have no <#> to turn to in my times of troubles .
"sure i have my mom , but i m not going to burden her with my problems ."
she deserves to live the last several years of her life happy with her loving husband .
i owe myself that but even more i owe my son .
i just thought i stopped by and let you people know that i m still pulling and pushing to get where to i want to be .
"i do nt know how long it 's going to take me but as long as i m in process , i know i have to get there someday ."
"hi everyone , it 's <UNK> , and i wo nt stay up for to long ."
"i am really proud of myself for t his <UNK> , and i thank the lord above for given me such gift and talent ."
it 's title my dearest friend : and i want to dedicated to al the people that believe in true strong friendship .
"my dearest friend ; even thou <UNK> far apart , always know your in my heart ."
"for when there is true friendship and love , is enough to conquer all ."
"including all troubles pain and <UNK> , that lies deep in beneath our hearts ."
"so always know that i 'll be here , just call out my name , and i 'll be there ."
"i promise you i 'll always stay , just as long you wo nt send me away ."
my dearest friend ; forever <UNK> ! author ; the the urllink <UNK>
"but i honestly have n't been feeling well at all , none whatsoever ."
i never got these many headaches til ' i got married !
", he honestly thinks is all about him and only him ."
"not to mention , he thinks i owe him the world !"
"he is such a stuck up , and so needy , greedy , and so money hungry all the time !"
"i could care less for money , ' honestly ' ."
he is totally so screwed for life if he do nt change !
he is really gonna loose me if hw do nt wise up !
i m sick and tired for having to pay for everything !
so i do nt understand why he <UNK> it my bill and that i should have to pay for <UNK>
""" i buy the <UNK> and so much more .... etc ."
", he gets mad if i buy anything for the house or myself ! like not to long ago i had to buy me new <UNK> and a computer !"
i say someone 's <UNK> do it since there ai nt no <#> man enough in the house to do it !
"i guess he has it in his mind somewhere , that the less money i spend the more for him !"
i know what you guys are probably thinkin out there
", you guys must be thinkin that he is using me and that i m <UNK> for allowing him to get over on me ."
"a fool i m not , cus i will never loose , for i know god <UNK> <#> with a <UNK> , and shower ones with many blessings ."
"i have never in my life been of a empty plate on the table , nor have i ever need anything from anyone ."
"as i continue , i am goin to tell you of the many pain and <UNK> that i have to face day after day ."
life is not at all easy nor <#> piece a cake .
"right now , i m going ti take a break , i do nt feel well and going to take something for this headache <UNK> makin me so <UNK> !"
"i m sorry , but i will be back if not today tomorrow ."
"i love you people out there , and i hope from <UNK> my life experiences that it will help you to do something different in <UNK> the better ."
"today has been a normal day for me i would say , me and my husband were apart just about all day ."
"he was at the my <UNK> belongs to the house "" working til <#> pm . on a freinds car ."
<UNK> for <#> <UNK> that has truly depressed me this past month .
like <#> weeks ago i realized that i was missing $ <UNK> !
i honestly do nt want to go around <UNK> no <#> .
"but as some people out there <UNK> you reed my blog "" , that i do nt have any friends and no <#> ever comes in my house ."
"i use to trust people at <#> time in my life , but after more than enough <UNK> in my life , i had to <UNK> my life completely ."
"so that is why i m sure no <#> else could 've taken that money , but my troubled , <UNK> husband ."
"he is the only soul here with me , and i have never trusted him based that he has stolen from me b4 for many reasons ."
"i know my boy would n't do such a thing , nor even cross his little mind ."
plus i trust my son with my life totally .
"i love him so much , words are n't enough to describe what i feel for him ."
"a husband is suppose to protect and make the wife feel secure , but it seems it all the contrary ."
"i do nt feel any of the things i just mentioned , if anything , i feel insecure in <UNK> ."
"later as i write my blog , i will fill you in ."
i knew it was going to turn out this way .
"i should 've known better , but maybe it was necessary for me to go thru this drama , since i always learn from my mistakes ."
"i am a person <UNK> believes in second chances , but he has had <#> too many already ."
"<UNK> now ; everything has a <UNK> in life , and there are just some lines you do nt cross , <UNK> even go there !"
"it 'll be just a matter of time , before i start my new life fresh and alone ; thank you !"
"well time for a break , i have to take care of something extremely important b4 i head on to rest ."
"hi , i m <UNK> ; <#> of my <UNK> is ; silent tears ; why ?"
i consider <UNK> elf to be a very private person .
"but at the same time , for a long time , i have carried deep scars within my heart ."
does it help for anyone to be hiding so much pain ?
"no ! pain <UNK> up to a point were you feel there is no way out , at times making you feel helpless ."
i feel respect and understanding is a mutual thing .
i do nt ever want to treat anyone the way i was treated as i was growing up and most thru out my life .
"today i 've turned out to be a very , caring , loving and giving person ."
"i chose a long time ago not to have any friends , due to bad experiences ."
"my only best friend is me , myself and i. i grew up having a very extremely bad and abusive childhood ."
"it 's because of what i went thru , that i want to make sure , that no <#> ever has to experience such <UNK> if anything"
", i have grown to be the most sensitive , caring and loving person there is today ."
"i have learned not to ever pass on to my future children , what was done to me , and all the bad things that happened to me ."
"i promise to all , i will back to fulfill my journey !"
<UNK> bless you all ill talk to you later on today .
"` have a great <UNK> least i hope <#> of us will , , , , , ."
"i m a very caring , loving person , but since i m sensitive , <UNK> what you say to me cus i will <UNK> into millions of pieces ."
at lunch i decided to pop to <#> of the numerous sandwich bars that can be found in central london .
"when i arrived i was , as always <UNK> by the wealth of options for my snack ."
"then.. i noticed some of the pre - <UNK> sandwiches had a <UNK> red sticker claiming them to be a "" meal deal !"
"well i thought this sounded like a super deal , and purchased all <#> , although i do n't normally buy <UNK> ... but what the hell"
... it means i could get the deal if i had them as well .
i <UNK> £ <#> ( as promised it was less than £ <#> ) and went on my way .
"while sitting in a small area of <UNK> i <UNK> my deal , and had some time to think about the offer ."
when i <UNK> up all of the costs i realise that there was no special deal for buying all <#> .
"just adding them together , without any discount is £ <#> ."
"i know it seems petty , and probably it is , but i do n't like being controlled in this way ."
"i like to look for good deals , but i also like to just get what i want ."
if i am going to buy something extra as part of a promotion or deal then i like to actually get a deal .
"i was reading a "" yahoo "" short news article this morning and there was <#> about that most wonderful and amusing american president george bush ."
is it possible for <#> man to make so many vocal errors ?
it probably raises his ratings in the personality polls at least .
"the more i think of it , the more i think it ’s due to the "" simpsons "" effect ."
"perhaps george is trying to <UNK> that icon of the great cultural revolution "" homer simpson "" ."
"welcome to the world of "" basically irrational "" ."
"i love to listen to what is going on in the world , and most of what i hear leaves me wondering "" why ? "" ."
i have a <UNK> feeling that i’m not the only <#> who feels this way .
"sometimes it ’s international events of great world importance , and other times it ’s local <UNK> on that make my jaw drop ."
i thought i would start up this blog to share my views on some of the events that i see and hear going on around me .
what i would love is to hook up with others who are left <UNK> by life in general .
"perhaps they will live just up the street , or maybe half way round the world ."
i am going to write up my first story for posting .
if someone out there beats me to it then that ’s cool .
i hope you enjoy getting my views as much as i’ll enjoy getting yours .
wow ... it is august 7th and only <#> degrees in western kentucky this morning .

it never <UNK> to <UNK> me the <UNK> people will go to blame someone about something .
everyone wants to find someone to blame for <#> - <#> .
i for <#> do not see how that is possible .
can anyone honestly say that they could have believed something like the events of that day would have taken place ?
an <UNK> bombing or even an attack on a u.s .
"<UNK> <UNK> is <#> thing , but a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> attack on some of the largest buildings in the world ?"
i served in the navy as an intelligence <UNK> for <#> years and i have seen a lot of information from a lot of sources .
i have met and worked with some of the finest <UNK> that you could imagine ; people dedicated to thier cause and work to the point of obsession .
i can safely say that in the world of <UNK> analysis it is not always possible to get a complete picture of events that are <UNK> .
a little info from here a little from there ; some false info from over there and so on .
imagine being an <UNK> and knowing something was going to happen but not being able to put your finger on it .
there are <UNK> of something big somewhere but all the info just is nt there .
accept the fact that it happened and there was nothing we could do to prevent it and move in with this anti - terror war .
i heard someone say the other day that all this homeland security stuff was a <UNK> of shit .
they went on to say that nothing has happened since sept 11th and that why should we have these restrictions .
nothing has happened because people are doing their job .
do nt point fingers over this ... do nt try to find someone to blame
lets spend all this energy in <UNK> that those responsible are brought down .
that s the best memorial we could do .
well enough of my <UNK> on this issue ........... for now at least .
i will be <#> in a few months .
have been very lucky in all that i have been able to see and do .
i have a few things i want to do before i die ( hopefully a long time away ) .
just curious if there is anyone else out there that wants to do some of the same things .

"i mean how many times do you have to say , "" throw the empty fucking coke can away ! ! ! ! """

this looks like the stadium crowd for a little league basket <UNK> contest .
little would you guess it 's the stadium crowd for <#> of the <#> athens olympic games .
i was talking to a friend of mine here and he asked if i had seen any reports of how slack the attendance is at the games .
", we did n't have the luxury of escaping the city for the games like the rest of the locals ."

we had <#> hell of a security set up here and that was before <#> - <#> .
"not only did we have awesome security , but look where it got us ."
we allowed a <UNK> - <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> to kill <#> people with a pipe bomb in the city park .
"if your turn is up , your turn is up ."
"the olympic committee thought about giving tickets away , but they said that would n't be fair to those who paid ."

"thankfully , the <UNK> didn’t last on us too long ."
we stayed another hour or so and then headed from home .
"and here , my friends , is where things got very strange ."
"when i woke up , my upper body was <UNK> with pain ."
"my toe was purple , swollen , and i believe , broken ."
"i can only conclude that yet again , the aliens <UNK> me to conduct <UNK> on my body ."
they then obviously gave me some type of memory - <UNK> substance so i would not recall how i was injured .
to <UNK> <#> weeks ago i was suffering from <UNK> ass pain .
"it <UNK> for a few days , and i could never determine the cause ."
"i know what you’re probably thinking , but no foreign object had come remotely close to my ass ."
i remembered a non - fiction book that i had read back in college about someone who was <UNK> <UNK> by aliens so they could <UNK> his body .
"upon <UNK> this tale , i knew that what i was experiencing was the awful <UNK> of an alien anal <UNK> ."
it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it .
"the mysterious injuries , the purple bruises that i frequently wake up with it ."
"refer to the list , specifically items <#> & <#> : urllink <UNK>"
"if anyone else has had a similar encounter , please share it with me ."
the type of treatment a person has depends on how severe the <UNK> is and what parts of her body are affected .
<UNK> ( say : an - tie - mah - <UNK> - ee - <UNK> ) drugs to help treat skin <UNK> and joint pain .
"( <UNK> drugs are <UNK> used to treat the disease <UNK> , but some have also been found to work against <UNK> . )"
"some people take <UNK> , which are <UNK> that help fight fatigue and fever and some of the other symptoms of <UNK> ."
these drugs help hold back the activity of the immune system .
"they are very strong , though , and are used only when it 's really necessary ."
<UNK> are doctors who have special training in <UNK> and treating <UNK> diseases .
"( <UNK> diseases are sometimes referred to as <UNK> diseases , which is where "" <UNK> "" comes from . )"
a <UNK> will ask the person many questions about her health and look for certain symptoms of <UNK> .
"people with <UNK> often have a fever that comes and goes , weight loss , or painful <UNK> ."
"they may have muscle aches , a rash , loss of appetite , swollen <UNK> , and hair loss ."
"sometimes they have <UNK> pain , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
"other people with <UNK> are sensitive to the sun , or they have lots of <UNK> in their mouths ."
"we do know that <UNK> is n't <UNK> , which means you ca n't ever catch any of the <#> types of <UNK> from someone ."
"<UNK> can affect the skin , <UNK> , <UNK> , and other body organs like the brain , heart , lungs , and <UNK> ."
it 's a much <UNK> form of <UNK> than <UNK> .
"it does n't affect organs the way <UNK> can , but the rash can leave scars ."
drug - induced <UNK> is caused by a reaction to some kinds of <UNK> .
drug - induced <UNK> affects the body in the same way that <UNK> does .
"once a person stops taking the medication , the symptoms often go away ."
<UNK> ( say : <UNK> - <UNK> ) is an <UNK> ( say : aw - <UNK> - im - <UNK> ) disease .
but the immune system of a person with <UNK> gets confused .
it ca n't tell the difference between <UNK> and some of the body 's normal cells .
so it <UNK> by making <UNK> ( say : aw - <UNK> - an - tie - ba - <UNK> ) .
these are <UNK> that attack the body 's normal cells .
"it 's a little like a soccer game gone <UNK> : instead of the <UNK> of a team protecting the goal , they actually turn against their team ."
they begin attacking their own <UNK> and scoring on their own goal .
"i feel all soft , gentle , wide - eyed and warm ."
no i am not like you ; i just do this on the weekends .
the rest of the <UNK> ? the rest of the time i am healthy ?
"when i was young i thought i was unique , my ideas , and spirit . now"
as i get older i fear that i may be just another person with <UNK> potential .
"i’m messing up more relationships , <UNK> is a flirt and i am ?"
"i took what is mine , and it felt good ."
the teacher told me i write well word - wise but my <UNK> is poor .
"who knows , i have these wild mood swings . today was a good day , not great ."
chad came back to work and i realized i had missed him .
it is so bad and i can’t fix it .
"i can’t fix myself , so i have been drinking in an attempt to get to sleep but it is so hot ."
i got all this time to wait and hate what i am .
people care about me but i have no idea why as i don’t care about myself .
the switch was the problem and kenny had to do a lot of extra work and some fast - talking because i fucked up .
i felt like i wanted to disappear for a while but now i can see it is just a matter of learning from it .
like telling a <UNK> what a great lesson he <UNK> head is <UNK> between the <UNK> of the <UNK> and
i feel like i wish i were some place else .
i blew off <#> people to be alone with it tonight .
i didn’t want to break down in front of anyone .
"how are you , how was your weekend , hot <#> isn’t it ."
"it <UNK> it , so when you need it becomes meaningless ."
no that is not where i am ending it .
when i am confident i tend to self - <UNK> .
told the truth and took the heat for my mistake .
caught what s her name checking me out in class .
my essay remains <UNK> <#> hours before it is due .
"<UNK> says i will show you my tits if you give me that "" ."
i think that what which i want is not to be obsessive and know every detail .
"i think that what i want is <UNK> that person , maybe not her , ok her , but not the <#> who was checking me out ."
"there is nothing wrong with it , not that i thought there was ."
not that i felt anything really except tight on the inside .
"today i took what i deserve , what everyone tells me to take , what is mine ."
these are the things that happen when i trust a little .
"unable to establish a connection , surely the modem is correctly connected to the computer and phone line ."
anyway this is where you can spill you know that .
i did things wrong but at least i tried .
just because i like it simple does not mean i should not try .
i need to try harder ; fuck <UNK> goes the air <UNK> .
breath and go back to kenny and get it that is what this is all about just get it done and don’t worry and test the switch again .
you know you will do better in a small shop .
you’re not going to sleep until you finish the fucking essay .
i have to figure out what i am doing with the blog .
i should post the archives and set it up but i really need to do the essay .
"she stops and look at me , did lori just call you ?"
i feel like i should stick around and explain but i have to pee so bad .
"i am so lost , ( maybe ) and she said she was going to test us on it ."
should read but i fixed jessie 's car cross your fingers .
when i am confident i tend to self <UNK> and i do better .
"the owner of the <UNK> say , we got that situation worked <UNK> look at him <UNK> and he say the whole <UNK> in the cup thing ."
"i say yes and he says good , everyone makes mistakes ."
i try to think of the right thing to say .
thank you and he shakes my hand and i feel better so i go get high .
"i do make mistakes but i take them so hard , my own worst critic , it is going to be written on my <UNK> ."
"i am editing right <UNK> the blog , is that a <UNK> <UNK> ?"
i am getting rid of the <UNK> so i can have a faster loading the <UNK> is laid out so nice .
the style sheet is <UNK> but very clear where and you are in it .
"so here 's my new home , someone found me so i moved ."
i'll put the the archives some place and i am looking forward to playing <UNK> <UNK> .
i was late getting to the office this morning because urllink arthur smells too good .
it ’s the same reason i was late yesterday and the day before .
arthur needs to keep his good smells to himself in the morning .
"in particular , his back which always smells like baking cookies ."
but only in the morning . and only his back .
what a lucky combination of sleep smells to wake up smelling like cookies .
"that , mixed with the smell of clean sheets is exactly what i need to fall back to sleep after the alarm goes off ."
"but , if i’m going to get up in time for work , i’ve got to start feeding him garlic the night before ."
it is this : we in western society do not lead meaningful lives .
"we have more than everything we need , and we’re just not happy ."
"basically my argument is that we’ve completed <#> to <#> in urllink <UNK> ’s <UNK> of needs , but instead of pursuing self - <UNK> , we’ve <UNK> <UNK> ."
"it ’s all we have left , if you believe the media ."
"now , we’ve become obsessed with the <UNK> of material goods as a way of filling that void ."
we work <UNK> stressful jobs so that we can make money so that we can acquire more “ things ” that we are told will make us happy .
"so , we work even harder so we can buy better “ things ” only to find that those don’t really make us happier either ."
we consume and consume and are completely defined by our work .
what ’s <#> of the first things you ask someone when you meet them ?
"i mean , it ’s even <#> of the main profile questions in blogger , for christ sake !"
"go to other parts of the world where people aren’t as stressed , and no <#> asks you “ what do you do ?"
"now , everyone ’s on <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> to control depression , <UNK> , <UNK> , etc ."
you just don’t see a lot of buddhist <UNK> on <UNK> .
"having the latest <UNK> , <UNK> , or trip to mexico just isn’t it ."
"i’m not saying we should all quit our jobs or go back to believing in a god that , quite frankly is as <UNK> as santa <UNK> ."
how often have you walked down the street and avoided making eye contact with someone walking <#> feet away from you ?
it ’s part of our whole culture of <UNK> ourselves and our stuff from each other .
"customer service calls , <UNK> meetings , speed dating , mass <UNK> ."
"i do n't normally post jokes , and certainly not ones about someone else 's <UNK> ."
"but , i thought this <#> was pretty good ."
"thanks , mom ! the last <#> ex - u.s ."
"presidents are caught in a tornado , and off they <UNK> to oz ."
they finally make it to the <UNK> city and came before the great wizard .
""" what brings you before the great wizard of oz ?"
""" jimmy carter steps forward <UNK> : "" i 've come for some courage . """
".... , i ....... i think i need a brain . """
""" who comes next before the great and powerful oz ? "" up steps george bush <UNK> ."
", sadly , "" i 'm told by the american people that i need a heart . """
""" i 've heard it 's true ! "" says the wizard ."
""" there is a great silence in the hall ."
"bill clinton is just standing there , looking around , but does n't say a word ."
"irritated , the wizard finally asks , "" what do you want ? "" "" is <UNK> here ? """
heh heh . some guy in the line at urllink tim <UNK> 's asked me if i was a nurse today .
i thought it was some kind of strange pickup and gave him the shrug off .
"she 's not a nurse , she 's a <UNK> something - or - other , but it all makes sense now ...."
i ca n't help but notice how disgusting my keyboard is right now .
did you know that your keyboard likely has more <UNK> living on it than a public toilet ?
i 'd already been heavily into the punch by then .
his skin looked very tan against his white t - shirt .
he was fit and beautiful and he knew it .
"and when he talked , it was like there was n't anyone else in the room ."
"he knew who he was , and he did n't care if you liked him ( but he knew you would ) ."
""" as soon as he said it , he knew he 'd blown it ."
"the vodka made it easier to recover , thankfully ."
"having recognized his <UNK> , he made a quick exit and i went home alone ."
"i did n't know it then , but we would meet again . and eventually , against my better <UNK> , i 'd marry him ."
"i like your hair up like that , "" says little <UNK> ."
"i thought i 'd dress up today , "" replies mom . """
""" <UNK> <UNK> "" pretty ? "" mommy supplies . """
here ’s something i just dug out of the archives of my brain .
"there was this girl , well woman now , really , who ’s <UNK> me all of my high school dating existence ."
i don’t know why and probably never will .
we went to the same school from the ages <#> to <#> .
i even visited her in the hospital in the 11th grade when she tried to kill herself .
"apparently , she was also <UNK> , but not very good at it from what i could tell ."
"i can’t remember if this is totally accurate , but it contains the main <UNK> ."
"i mean , how many elvis ’s are there in any <UNK> town ?"
"i thought it was weird that she would date an ex , as my friends didn’t usually do that to each other , but what the hell ."
"she and elvis became really good friends , from what i’ve heard ."
"anyway , she went on to date <UNK> not too long after we’d broken up ."
"she went on to have a serious relationship with <UNK> , which i found <UNK> creepy , as we’d been quite an item ."
"he thought it was funny , but it just <UNK> my paranoia ."
apparently she also hooked up with shane after our romance ended rather <UNK> for reasons that i can only describe as “ very bad .
"i don’t know if she had the same problems with him that i did , but that ’s a different story ."
"anyway , at the time , i had no idea why she would want to date these guys ."
"in <UNK> , i think she had a lot of self - esteem issues and these guys were all readily available and recently rejected ."
"they were all from our high school , and i had broken up with them all rather <UNK> and without thought for their feelings ."
i always wondered if she <UNK> their wounds and <UNK> with them on what a nasty bitch i was .
"i used to think that i was just being paranoid and arrogant , but now i’m not so sure ."
"but , then i think that it ’s not important enough to worry about ."
isn’t . it just makes me shake my head a bit and smile .
i 'm also really glad that arthur and i never dated in high school .
update on the kitten front for those who are n't sick to death of hearing about it .
"so does <UNK> , but he 's not so obvious about it ."
"<UNK> either <UNK> in the corner , or in his <UNK> ."
"he does n't run away when i brush him , though , and his quiet little motor turns on ."
"as soon as <UNK> starts <UNK> , then sweetie <UNK> for no reason and pushes his head against my hand ."
"he wears his heart on his sleeve , that <#> does ."
"by the end of this week , i think we can consider them family members . :)"
"for those of you who have seen the urllink <UNK> commercials , do n't believe them ."
"basically , everything you see on the commercials is all that there is ."
"it has n't changed much since i went there when i was <#> ( that 's <#> years ago , for those counting ) ."
"you can buy food and urllink feed bears , deer , urllink killer <UNK> ( i 'm not kidding ) , and urllink <UNK> <UNK> ."
"there must be <#> bears in their exhibit , and they 're all begging for food ."
"you know a ride is not good when your <UNK> old tells you "" that was lame . """
"but the <UNK> was very good , and almost worth the <#> <#> hour drive to <UNK> falls ."
"arthur would n't take us to actually see the falls , though ."
"its funny , just yesterday i joined the tank along and now my tank is done ."
i think this pattern would have been better if written in the round .
i may <UNK> it for the round and try knitting another tank .
this will be the first time i have tried re - working a pattern .
"i used <UNK> cotton twist yarn , but i do not really like it ."
the yarn split very easily which made working with it difficult .
"so , this will probably be the last project that i make with cotton twist ."
we are starting our own digital photography business called <UNK> .
check us out at our website : urllink <UNK> .
you can scroll the image to show you the entire room as if you were standing in the room .
you can also <UNK> in if there is something you 'd like a closer look at .
"lastly , we can put in <UNK> which give more detailed information about the item in the photograph ."
today my daughter and i got italian charm <UNK> .
it is nice that they do not <UNK> down and interfere with my knitting .
"anyways , i thought it would be something fun to do together ."
she says that she wants a charm to remind her about her family .
"oh , i almost forgot -- <#> of my <UNK> is about knitting ! ! :)"
"as a christian and a <UNK> of christ , i know that i am in the world but not of the world ."
"lately , this truth has taken on a new deeper meaning to me ."
i used to think that it just meant that i am here only temporarily .
but i think it also means that there are times when the culture i live in will clash with my values .
this is particularly true during election season . because the republican party is pro - life ( or anti - abortion )
the truth is they are not any more christian or moral than any other party and they are not pro - life .
"if you show compassion for the poor and unfortunate , they call you a bleeding - heart liberal ."
they would prefer to leave the poor ( adults and children too ) starving on the streets .
"and we have many poor americans doing just that , right now , today ."
is the war in iraq pro - life ? ?
"speaking of war , watch out iran , it looks like you will be next ."
i think president bush is a war - <UNK> and he seems to be on the <UNK> .
"unfortunately , because he is the president of the united states , he has the power to take the entire country on the <UNK> with him ."
"that is , investment income from the stock market not <UNK> that <UNK> americans earn at their jobs ."
they say that most stock is owned by american workers -- but how much stock does the average american family really own ?
the people who own lots of stock and really benefit are the ceo - types .
these are the people who lay off the aforementioned hard working americans to make their stock rise <#> of a point .
the republicans claim to be financially responsible with the federal budget .
they cut taxes to the wealthy and then cut primarily social programs and borrow money to make up the difference .
"meanwhile , the democrats increase taxes to fund social programs ."
is <#> really any better or worse than the other ?
i certainly have problems with the democratic party too .
"they are trying to win the female vote by supporting "" <UNK> rights ."
they want to allow people to kill <UNK> babies for no reason other than the child 's life is <UNK> .
that is what <UNK> is for ! ! ! ! ! ! !
people need to think before they act ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"go ahead and call it a <UNK> , that does not change what it is ."
science has shown us that we are <UNK> and <UNK> have live birth .
that means that the child is alive before birth .
do you doubt it -- go listen to the heartbeat at <#> weeks <UNK> .
so abortion kills a human being -- plain and simple .
"then if i choose to go to the voting booth and vote my conscience on this issue , the democrats argue that i am forcing my opinion on others ."
you know why -- we live in a democracy ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the majority rules -- sometimes i am in the majority and sometimes i am in the minority .
i have just as much right to vote my conscience as anybody else .
pro - life people have just as much a right to vote as i do .
i will not stop voting my conscience just because someone else may not like my vote .
they can vote too and the majority will rule .
former president clinton was doing his thing with you - know - who while the government was <UNK> .
"come on , people , there is a time to focus on <#> 's job not <#> 's <UNK> ."
i was a <UNK> federal employee wondering when i would get back to work and how was i going to pay my bills in the mean - time .
congress did eventually decide to pay us because the stale - mate was not our fault .
"however , there were many businesses and others also affected and they were never <UNK> ."
because the democrats and the republicans could not work and play well with others .
"there are many things in both parties that <UNK> christianity , but i have to stop somewhere ."
what it <UNK> down to is if <#> party if for something the other will be against it .
it does not matter if the subject in question makes sense .
what <#> is for the other must be against .
i do not believe that jesus would be a card - carrying republican .
in the bible there were the <UNK> and the <UNK> .
today in america there are the republicans and the democrats .
this decision is not the no - <UNK> that the religious right wants me to think it is .
"we are to love god with all of our heart , soul , body and mind ."
i did not check my brains at the door when i gave my life to christ .
instead i will think and pray and do the best that i can when i vote in november .
my political rant is now over and i shall return to the knitting already in progress .
i just tried on my <UNK> tank and the fit is <UNK> .
i still have to knit the border onto the neck line and the <UNK> .
i wish that it was written for knitting in the round because i really do n't like to <UNK> .
i think that this is because i knit <UNK> and it is difficult to get enough tension while <UNK> .
i did get lots of <UNK> practice with this project and i can definitely <UNK> faster and better than before .
i 'll post some pictures after i get the border finished .
"right now , you can see my bra and that is not a good sight ."
"my <UNK> had been small and <UNK> , but then <UNK> got paid and i went shopping ."
now i have lots of yarn and <#> projects on the needles .
"i get a lot of pleasure out of living in a organized , <UNK> - free space ."
"so , i found some neat storage <UNK> that i can stack on top of each other ."
"i divided my yarn into <#> categories : <UNK> , cotton and wool ."
then i put each group in its own drawer .
"best of all , the <UNK> were on sale ."
i love a bargain too . just a quick update on my knitting progress :
i have finished the front of the <UNK> tank and i have started the back .
the pattern says to bind off the shoulders and then <UNK> the front and back shoulders together .
"however , i prefer to avoid sewing so i have decided to leave them on stitch <UNK> and then i can do a <#> needle bind - off instead ."
"it looks like it may be coming out a little long , but i think this will be ok ."
the pattern calls for a lot of sewing together of pieces .
"so i thought that instead of <UNK> off the <UNK> , i would change to my main color and keep knitting in the round for a few inches ."
this would also increase the length of the sweater .
then i thought i would put the <UNK> for the front on stitch <UNK> and do the back .
lastly i would come back and to the front .
"for the collar , i will pick up stitches ."
hopefully i wo n't have to do any sewing .
"besides , it will be a while before it is cold enough for <UNK> to wear it ."
we had a nice celebration for him -- spaghetti and <UNK> for dinner followed by cake and ice cream .
"it was a small celebration , just us and some friends of the family ."
"his <UNK> includes : <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> toy story <#> version , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"red metal old - fashioned radio <UNK> <UNK> and helmet , and a remote control car ."
it is a simple figure <#> <UNK> with wind - up cars .
allen and sean even <UNK> their own version of a <UNK> <UNK> .
he also got some buzz <UNK> t - shirts .
today was katie 's last day of swimming lessons .
"she had lessons for the past <#> weeks at camp <UNK> in <UNK> , wa ."
she has learned so much -- jake the instructor was awesome .
"woo hoo . while katie had her lessons , sean got to play in the <UNK> pool ."
sean is very comfortable playing in the <UNK> pool .
he does n't even need me to go in with him .
my goal for katie was that she learn to swim and she did .
my goal for sean was that he become comfortable in the water and he did .
i messed up on my <UNK> on the <UNK> tank .
i thought i was knitting <#> <UNK> but in reality it was more like <#> <UNK> .
the result is my tank was coming out way too big for me .
"so , i am sending it to the frog pond and starting all over again ."
"well after a break from the heat , it is getting hot here again ."
my little son has decided that he want to wear his <UNK> ( the long pants kind ) .
"he never liked them before , but today , when it is hot , he wants to wear them ."
i took the kids to swimming lessons today so they got a chance the cool off and play .
"while they were doing that , i sat in the shade and cast on for my urllink <UNK> tank ."
the yarn i am using is <UNK> 's cotton twist color # <#> which is a nice shade of red .
"i had originally bought the yarn to make the <UNK> tank , but decided that the yarn was n't suitable for that project ."
"since the yarn itself is great yarn , i decided to switch projects ."
i did a lot of casting on this weekend .
i cast on for my urllink <UNK> -- the yarn for this project is <UNK> yarn 's <UNK> silk .
it will be nice to see all the finished <UNK> out there .
the absolute best thing about today is that my husband and i got a year 's of free gym <UNK> .
we are starting a digital photography business <UNK> in <UNK> photographs .
we did a set of <UNK> free for our gym so that we could use them on our website as an example of our work .
they loved them so much that they asked if we would do <UNK> of their other <#> <UNK> .
so they are giving us free <UNK> in exchange for the <UNK> .
"sadly , tomorrow is the last time ds will have a session with his speech therapist ."
he is turning <#> on saturday and will be too old for the birth to <#> program .
he did qualify for the <UNK> <UNK> at our public school .
"so he will get more speech therapy , but not from laura ."
we 'll miss laura and hope we can keep in touch with her as friends .
allen and i looked through the fall <#> issue of <UNK> <UNK> and he really liked the basket <UNK> <UNK> .
so he chose a yarn that he liked and i ordered it .
i have never knit anything that required so much yarn as this <UNK> will .
"so , i must be crazy , but i am going to do it ."
"i think that if i start now , i may have it finished by <UNK> ."
the yarn he chose was brown sheep 's nature spun and the color is <UNK> coffee .
"see , he really is a coffee - <UNK> ."
i made the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bag from stitch '
n <UNK> i made it about <#> % wider and taller than the pattern called for .
i am going to use it for carrying our stuff to the kids ' swimming lessons .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i took it to the pool today along with my digital camera to take pictures of the kids .
i realized that it would be nice to have a pocket on the inside for carrying my camera .
"i have some leftover yarn , so i am going to try making a pocket and <UNK> it to the inside of the <UNK> bag ."
"the little <UNK> bag , whatever , was really nice for holding my car keys ."
"i 've seen other people 's blogs , and i thought <UNK> not try making <#> too ?"
i have no idea how often i 'll be posting here .
i 've played around with the templates and i found <#> that i like .
i also discovered that i can edit my posts .
i am such a <UNK> and i love improving things .
"but , you know what , knitting is helping me overcome <UNK> ."
"every time i started to knit something , i would tell myself that this <#> will be perfect ."
"then i would make a mistake , but not discover it for a while ."
"i was forced to decide , is it worth it to fix it ."
i am going to find a nice photo of myself to add to my profile .
it sure looks like it could use a picture up in the corner there .
my friends and i are planning a tag sale in september .
we will be offering <UNK> cottage style goods in a beautiful setting in the evening under the stars .
we have been buying and <UNK> some great <UNK> finds for the sale .
our plan is to do these sales <#> - <#> x per year .
"creating displays or settings with our "" finds "" is very important to our sale mission ."
"stay tuned for more "" tag sale "" details :)"
this morning i went to <#> estate sales looking for <UNK> goods .
i have a mental list that keeps me focused .
the first sale i arrived at was limited entry .
"there just happened to be another sale <#> blocks away , so i <UNK> out of line and headed to the next <#> !"
it was a little creepy on the outside and almost as creepy on the <UNK> i <UNK> through to the <UNK> and found some wonderful things !
my eye caught the site of a lovely white on white <UNK> - but geez - no price .
i decided to hold on to it any way and check the price out .
then i found a pretty plate with a <UNK> lady on the front with mint green trim .
before heading to the front to pay i also noticed <#> white <UNK> table <UNK> .
the dealer quoted me a price of $ <#> for the white on white <UNK> and that came home with me also !
i then went back to the limited entry estate sale - and was glad that i did not stay in <UNK> was way to high ! heading closer to home
i found a bag of great black and white photo 's that had some funky <#> 's style pictures that i bought .

"there is alot of fear involved in living an "" alternative lifestyle "" ."
"then why judge someone who tries so <UNK> and fails to <UNK> to your <UNK> "" norm "" when he finally says "" enough is enough ? """
this goes on for <UNK> all over the world .

"you try to date boys if you are a girl because that 's just what you do when you are a "" normal "" girl ."
"the reverse , of course , is also there ."
the pain of knowing that you are not like other girls ( or boys ) but are expected to be so is crushing .
and so we learn to deny our true selves .
we try to adapt to society in order to be accepted .
"but while we are trying to do what this society demands , we slowly crush our spirit by denying our truth ."
"and so while there may be more than meets the eye with the <UNK> story , sure , judge him if you must for having an <UNK> affair ."

"my wife stated that she thinks "" <UNK> "" is a gender unto itself ."
this is a term i have long loved and used to describe myself .
and i could definitely claim this <UNK> as my gender .
i have always seen myself in conflict with my male and female sides .
the label of <UNK> would very well resolve those conflicts and give me a sense of identity i otherwise feel i lack when it comes to gender identity .
"so if i were the only person on the face of the earth , would i go thru surgery ?"
"well , i am not a <UNK> but i have had the pleasure of talking to several ."
"some say that yes , they would still want surgery in order to find that peace within themselves ."
"some have said that without other people to act as their social mirrors , they 'd feel no need to go thru surgery ."
"therefore , gender is both a social <UNK> and hard - wired ."
i suppose the answer to this question would lie in which of the <#> <UNK> is strongest for you .

"this event looks at the many issues surrounding gender for <UNK> , genetic women , <UNK> women ."
"no matter a woman 's status on her journey , she is welcome with open hearts ."
"i am truly blessed to really be present to take part in such a wonderful event , celebrating <UNK> in all its <UNK> shapes ."
we had wonderful hosts who shared their land and their home ( and hot tub ) with us .
we had <#> acres of <UNK> land to explore and rest in .
we saw <UNK> and <UNK> and enjoyed the utter <UNK> and quiet of the country .
"and i actually had wonderful vegetarian food and ate like a horse , which my beloved wife was happy to see ."
i had forgotten the pleasure of being in so much <UNK> <UNK> female power .
it reminds me how <UNK> i am to be able to <UNK> my story and appreciate my <UNK> .
let the party begin so i decided as my wife was working late to set up a little blog .
i became addicted to life at tj 's and decided i have a big mouth and <UNK> fingers .
so what do i hope to accomplish ? to just assault you with my regular brain <UNK> .
a little about me : i am a <#> year old happily married woman to my same - sex partner of <#> years ( yay portland ! ) .
"i am the office manager at the software company she founded ( hey , <UNK> is ok as long as you keep it in the family ) ."
"in addition to my <UNK> work duties at this small <UNK> , i am going to school <UNK> to ( finally ) earn my bachelor 's degree ."
this has only been <#> years in the making .
"once upon a time , i thought i wanted to be a social worker ."
but then i decided i would be likely to punch out people who abuse their <UNK> or kids .
not exactly the type to be an effective social worker .
"so recently , i saw an ad for this online university ."
fits my schedule ( barely ) and give me a degree in a field i am interested in ( <UNK> with focus in human resources management ) .
the kids are grown and almost all are out of the house .
so now i am left with my <UNK> kids ( <#> dogs currently in jail for escaping the back yard while we were at work ) and <#> <UNK> .
"we occasionally have a visit from <UNK> and a long time ago , there were <UNK> <UNK> at night ."
"i am no more than <#> hours from the mountains or the water and contrary to popular belief , it does not rain all the time ."
"in fact , we too are suffering from the <UNK> ."
i have lived all over the country and this is my favorite by far .
i 'll post whenever i need to de - stress from the hectic environment at work . or if bush pisses me off again .
well times are really hard at this time .
we made the decision to ask the group that was causing us grief and working against our mission to leave .
we have the full support of our dc however other staff are causing <UNK> for us because of the government funding .
it is going to be tough for some weeks now and we are in the middle of a lengthy process .
sometimes we have to do hard things to remain true to what god has called us to .
it just feels a little black at the moment but i am sure god will shine through .
i am in ministry in <UNK> which is the island state of australia .
my extended family and <#> of my sons are on the main land of australia so there is a stretch of water that <UNK> us .
being brought up in a close <UNK> family this really bothered me at first however i count my blessings because where god has placed me i am really fortunate .
they care for each other and they care for us as we care for them .
i thank god because there are not many churches that have such a wonderful atmosphere to minister in .
where else would i be blessed to be able to part of this kind of ministry .
where else would i be fortunate enough to engage with the world in this way ?
it has been a really hard week in ministry .
( the conflict is <UNK> our energy levels )
the police arrived on our <UNK> with <#> children that are part of our corps family as their mother had been beaten senseless by her partner .
the police said that children 's services would nt respond so they brought them to us .
this makes a total of <#> of us in the household .
<#> of our saints is dying in hospital his daughter rang to say he is at his last .
"we have finally found a site for our new <UNK> shop , the <UNK> works for our employment programs are going along steadily ."
"the variety and business is always rewarding however , the conflict , <UNK> conflict <UNK> energy <UNK> that could be better used for ministry ."
well god is bigger than all of this and we need to trust our situation into his hands .
"well , i feel as though we are at present being tried by fire ."
it is difficult when things happen that are so out of your control and you have to face the music .
we have the backing of our bosses now so that is good but the in - between guys are making life difficult .
we just want this to end so we can get on with god 's business .
sometimes i feel as though i wish god would just remove some of the passion that flows through my vein as it often causes me deep pain .
i sometimes have moments when i wish i could just be content with the status <UNK> and just go with the flow .
"the program is a joint program between the salvation army and another <UNK> , the staff are not christians and do not share our mission goals ."
"does anyone have this answer , i 'm sure it is the same in other <UNK> also ."
our corps members are clearly focused on mission and are looking forward to the new corps based employment programs to start soon .
but maybe god will give someone some wisdom to pass on .
"anyway , enough need to focus thoughts on worship , i love <UNK> it takes you away from life for awhile into the <UNK> ."
"it 's saturday morning and we finally have a chance to catch a day off ,"
well hopefully it will be a day off .
we are never too sure what the day will bring .
we see these programs as a way of <UNK> the sense of community that we hope to create at our corps centre .
i love it and would n't change it for the world
", you never know what a day will bring and it is real <UNK> ministry just being there for people ."
it is just being where god needs us to be .
i am always thankful for the opportunities he opens up for me in ministry .
the frustrations are always <UNK> by the opportunities ( well almost always ) <UNK>
"well , i have enjoyed adding comments to other peoples blogs , now i am going to have a go at doing this myself so here goes ."
the department of family services would nt have sam back the <UNK> refused to take sam .
so my husband brought her home to be safe whilst her mother got rid of the violent partner .
"i was a little <UNK> , sam is a very <UNK> <#> year old girl who has been around awhile ."
we have <#> teenagers ourselves and <#> <#> year old .
i must give my children enormous credit as we often have <UNK> like sam in our home .
i thank sam for what she has taught me .
i 'm an emotional basket case ... tonight is the gathering .
he 's in l.a . and taking a nap at his hotel .
i ca n't figure out why this gets to me so much .
"the writer probably wo nt ' be there , so it looks like it 's the girls and jason and his other buddy ."
at least he 's listening to me about it and not getting angry .
"he said not to make up a fake reality about what 's going on , but he understands the fears i have ."
he promises that it will all be okay .
"i guess i just worry that he 'll drink too much and not be rational , then get himself in a position that could be <UNK> ."
i know it 's irrational of me to think like that . and
"there will be pictures , and i 'm sure they will be up on <UNK> ."
it really affected him when i told him how it made me feel like i did when i was with jeff .
and i think he realizes that i wo n't stick around like i did with jeff .
i hope he sleeps through it all .... that 's mean .
"i want him to be happy , but i do n't want her to be there ."
i told him it 's hard because she 's with him and i 'm not and i should be the <#> there with him .
that 's when he told me not to make this out like it 's something that it 's not .
i think he 'll honor his promise to stay away from her .
i hope he does n't lie anymore when he 's finally here .
it would be devastating to our relationship if he did ....
"so i started this blog with a bunch of depressing , relationship centered junk ."
it 's definitely time to get things back on track and start new .
jason 's and my reunion in a few days will be great and will be the beginning of a new chapter in our lives .
i think we go through things at particular times in our lives in order to shed that skin and move on .
"some people just get stuck , but fortunately jason and i are moving forward ."
"as long as he does n't continue that behavior , and as long as i am not obsessed with it all that is ... new <UNK> ... scary ."
we have moved thousands of miles from where we started .
we have gone through more in the <#> years we 've been together than most people go through in <#> .
"through it all , we continue to fall in - love all over again ."
i would count us as some of the lucky ones .
sometimes that 's difficult to see though .... and sometimes i do n't want to give up that much of myself .
but i think this last episode made me realize that i ca n't continue to hold back .
i need to give my all to this relationship if i expect the same in return .
i 'm not saying that i hold back my love for him ... that 's never been a problem .
i protect myself from hurting too much ... from being too disappointed .
"i still get hurt , and i still am let down ..."
i used to be a mess when i was sad .
"now i know i 've built up this protection measure , but it really holds me back from experiencing all that i can as well ."
i 'm not like most people ... this i 've known for a very long time .
i think ( just based on how others deal with stuff ) .
what i mean by that last statement is that i believe myself to be an <UNK> .
i tend to take on the emotions of those around me .
sometimes it 's quite overwhelming to be in a room full of people because the <UNK> are just so intense .
i also confuse things alot and that makes me feel emotions that i probably would n't feel under normal circumstances .
"when i 'm happy , i 'm really happy ."
i 'm sure there is some wierd chemical <UNK> somewhere in me ... but i think that spiritually i have some big lessons to learn .
"i do nt ' really trust people ... why , i do n't really know ."
"i 've been hurt all through my life , but i still like people ..."
i just do nt ' trust most of them .
"anyway , all this leads me back to what i started here , i need to give in and allow myself to open up to my husband ...."
i need to allow myself to feel every aspect of this relationship and to allow him to share in that .
i need to be more vocal about my feelings instead of being afraid of them .
i want my daughter to see me as someone who is n't always afraid .
i want her to be honest and open with her emotions and to trust .
i want my husband to know all of me and to enjoy it as much as he does now ...
i trust that he will love me even more ...
i will continue to help him learn to be honest ...
i will continue to strive to be the best i can be and to have the best marriage possible .
i will dance and i will sing and i will laugh .
so jason and i finally had a real honest to goodness talk about everything .
"he was n't happy with my email , nor with the fact that i still questioned him ."
"we discussed how he felt and i told him my fears , <UNK> it started out awkward and sad ... with alot of frustration ."
but it ended very nicely with some understanding .
the next day was better ... and the day after that even better .
"last night we had a great talk , all night actually for me ( <#> hours difference is really messing with us ) ."
"he was <#> % open to discussing the party and who would be there ... and who would n't , namely her ."
i guess his friend said she was n't going .
so we 'll see if she shows up ... but i wo n't make an issue out of it because i know he 'll be honest about it .
he told me the place he 'll be staying - a hotel near the club .
he said he 'd call ... then he said he wanted me to get on a plane and meet him there .
was really <UNK> that i go and said he missed me and wanted me to be by his side so we could have fun together that night .
i told him i could n't leave <UNK> all night just yet .
he was really wanting me to think about it and look into the possibility of it happening .
he <UNK> my mind on so many issues and i feel that he really wants to make another attempt at gaining trust .
i felt like i was falling in - love with him again last night and was really missing him . <#> more days ...
<UNK> has been really <UNK> her <UNK> lately to everything .
"she has <UNK> the word "" no "" and "" do n't "" and uses them freely ."
i think jason is going to be shocked when he sees her .
she 's so cute and smart and knows how to use her <UNK> already to make things happen .
she is very loving when in the mood too .
"but man , if she 's pissed at you , then she 's pissed for awhile ."
"she 's not happy with me leaving her sight for even a moment , no <UNK> ."
"it 's funny most of the time , but can be frustrating at other times ."
"quite the surprise , but makes me understand more why i was so <UNK> .... life goes on ..."
so i am having flowers sent to j for his last day at work .
"i found a nice tropical arrangement at a local <UNK> in hawaii , so he should n't have any problems getting them on time - friday ."
he is so anxious to get out of there .
i felt the same way when i was leaving for here .
now i am thinking i should have stayed longer ... considering all the problems we seem to be having now .
"this is what i said : "" hey ..."
i am really missing you this morning and feeling kind of down .
- <#> weeks feels like such a long time .
i guess i 'm just feeling emotional after everything that has gone on
"it seems whenever we have a problem , you holding me tight always makes it better ."
i feel like crying and do n't want anyone here to know that i 'm sad right now .
"so i guess i believe that if i talk to you about it , i will feel better somehow ."
i just do n't know what to do with all these emotions .
"nothing so bad happened that it 's the end of the world , but enough happened that i just feel worn out i guess ."
and i know it does n't help that you and i are apart right now .
i just love you so much jason and i do n't want to lose you ...
"i feel like i 've lost some of my sense of direction and i 'm struggling a little to find the path back , you know ?"
"i do n't know what to think , where to go or who to talk to ."
i feel alone and hurt and sad and all i want is you here telling me
i want you to run your fingers along the inside of my elbow and help me fall asleep at night .
i want to feel your kisses and see the truth and love in your eyes .
it 's just the emotional <UNK> that is catching up with me .
i do n't want there to be an <UNK> ... i do n't want there to be a wall ...
i know it 's in me and i have to deal with it .
... it 's just so difficult at times to push it out of my head .
"i am hoping all this will bring us closer , but i 'm afraid of being pulled apart too ."
"i 'm a drama queen , i know ... it 's no wonder our daughter is so dramatic ."
"i also believe that it is n't fair to either of us for me to keep my emotions bottled up because they are valid , you know ?"
you always ask me what is going on ... and i am telling you now .
i love you jason ... you and the kids are my life .
"i just want to feel okay again ... """
it 's a bit depressing and i am now <UNK> that it was so long .
"he commented on it , said he was sorry ."
we really did n't have a chance to talk much about it actually .
maybe he 'll email me later when he has a chance - although somehow i doubt it .
i think he just wants it to go away .
so how long to i dwell on this ?
i 'm beginning to bore myself with it all .
i guess i 'm afraid of letting it go because i still do n't trust that he is <#> % honest with me .
i think ... i guess time will tell .
i 'm having trouble believing in someone who i should be believing in ... and i 'm a bit sad about that .
"nothing earth - <UNK> occurred , but enough of a <UNK> was present to shake me up ."
now i 'm trying to build back the trust that was taken out of me .
i ca n't wait until he is home again in my arms - <#> more weeks !
"plus there is the party coming up ... and she 'll be there with him , while i 'm here with our baby girl ."
we are in the middle of moving several thousands of miles from home and i 'm where we are settling while he is finishing up some loose ends .
she said she felt <UNK> ... he told her she was beautiful ...
then he told me he said it all out of pity for her . what ? !
"i did n't believe any of that , but i let him talk and use it as an excuse ."
the <UNK> of it all just cut me .
"he tried to make her feel better , but was making me feel worse ."
"i did n't feel like i came first , and she was just some freakin stranger trying to cause trouble ."
"i let him listen to me cry on the phone , not because i was trying to be <UNK> , but because i could n't stop crying ."
he felt really badly about it and we started moving forward .
"then the new <#> came along , or rather had been there for awhile <UNK> to me ."
several of these internet <UNK> are apparently getting together for drinks while my love is in that part of the country on his way to me here .
then all of a sudden it was a party .
"i knew that was a lie , i know he invited her himself"
... it was n't a surprise for him .
"and i know he wo n't back out of it now , even though we 've been dealing with all this <UNK> !"
he did tell her that he could n't talk to her in i
"i emailed her as well , <UNK> her for understanding ."
she wrote back a very nice email and i appreciate it alot .
he said he wanted me to know that she meant nothing to him and that he would do anything to make our marriage the best it could be .
"i still am not comfortable though with it all ... and i realize why , because he lied ... and kept lying ."
he told me he was afraid it would be wierd for me ...
"he thinks it 's over , at least until the party comes up next week ."
"it 's because of my first husband and all his secrets ( which is <#> of the reasons he was my "" first "" <UNK> ..."
"it 's because i feel betrayed , even in a small way , and i did n't see it coming"
and i know he loves me just as much - but he still hurt me
... it 's because he 's so far away and i ca n't see his eyes telling me the truth ...
.... it 's because i 've seen his comments online about other naked women ....
it 's because i 'm scared of losing him ...
it 's because my heart has been broken over and over and i 'm afraid that <#> of these days it wo n't repair itself ...
"it 's because i 'm insecure , sad and lonely right now ...."
it 's because some days i feel <UNK> of a lasting relationship ...
"it 's because i want so badly to talk to him about it and to really understand , but am afraid to open the wound back up <UNK> ..."
"it 's because he 's not here with me , but will be there with her - even if it 's just having a beer together ."
i 'm hoping that this will help me sort some of this out .
"i 'm hoping that as soon as he 's here , it will all go away ."
"and i 'm hoping either he does n't go to the party , or she does n't go ."
"i feel rather ancient today , if truth be told ... yesterday i finally organised insurance cover for <UNK> to drive my car ."
"i 've never been a great <#> for white - <UNK> rides , but have to say that her driving was really quite reasonable ."
"after all , an unexpected traffic <UNK> after a <UNK> <UNK> might surprise <UNK> and there is no doubt that her <UNK> is excellent !"
i know she 'll be back on tuesday ( albeit briefly ) but this is a <UNK> at least ....
not quite sure where this week has gone : <#> <UNK> in <#> days probably has alot to do with the speed at which time <UNK> past ...
"i know they are all special to the families involved , and believe me we do our <UNK> to ensure that they feel this ."
"i rather think god does <UNK> , though , you engage differently in different <UNK> , and some touch you personally more than others ."
"yesterday 's was for a lady whom i 'd been <UNK> to spend a long afternoon with , only a few days before she died ."
"in the event , the church was full and the little house afterwards <UNK> with love and concern , under which the family <UNK> ."
<UNK> that the wife and mother who was so precious to them was loved and <UNK> in so many different <UNK> .
"thank you to everyone who prayed , supported and responded to yesterday 's blog ...."
"it would be too much to say that things are brighter today , but the weight of misery is maybe slightly less overwhelming ."
"so we played in the sunshine and "" they "" did the grown up bits inside the church .... and a good time was had by <UNK> )"
i had never seen myself as a mrs <UNK> but clearly i have these tendencies ... to no avail .
"all i can do is stand at the foot of the cross and weep ...... for which , of course , there is rather a <UNK> ."
thanks to those whose <UNK> in the sadness made this more possible .
is it purely the <UNK> of countless <UNK> of my <UNK> past ... or is there something inherently special about the words selected and arranged thus ...
"some words , i 'm sure , are themselves <UNK> ... they achieve what they <UNK> or describe ."
"i suspect this may be a glimpse of the <UNK> obvious , and something others have considered long since ...."
"<UNK> anyway , and nobody forced you to read to the bitter end , did they ? ?"
"today , my day off , i decided to <UNK> myself with the children by a proper day out ."
"amazing beach , with huge stones , and <UNK> rocks which make most convincing sleeping dragons ... plus handy cave for lunch in the rain ."
"all very happy , then as rain <UNK> and swimming looked increasingly unlikely , we went in search of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
the church itself was tiny and quite appealing ... on the edge of a tiny <UNK> of <#> houses .
"it houses the smallest and least threatening <UNK> i 've ever <UNK> so much "" <#> feet above <UNK> "" as "" a small step above uncertainty "" ."
""" g <UNK> in some disgust that only i could find myself in the middle of <UNK> doing theological reflections about dead flowers ...."
"sadly , i fear he might not be right ... and that others might also see it this way ."
"the thing is , it 's not just professional <UNK> ..."
"this morning i visited a family who come to our "" <UNK> and <UNK> "" <UNK> church ..."
"<UNK> , they had asked for a service of thanksgiving rather than baptism for the younger children , and when i met their dad it all made sense ."
"he was a really thoughtful guy , with no <UNK> <UNK> whatsoever , who nonetheless said that he "" respected church too much to make empty promises there "" ."
"it turned out that this is a second relationship for his mother , and that the father of the girls , is going to adopt j too ...."
"hard to tell which of us was more thrilled , really ..... and they call this sort of thing "" work "" ."
"when i first went with michael to visit her , he warned me that she might be a little cool , given her strong views on <UNK> ."
"a quick visit last friday morning turned into nearly <#> hours , we had so much to say to each other ."
a return trip was in the diary for today ... but it 's too late .
she waited until her daughter and family returned from holiday in the states on tuesday ... fell into a <UNK> on wednesday and moved on yesterday afternoon .
"she 'd allowed us to come so far along the road with her , it hurts that neither of us were there at the end ."
"go well , <UNK> , straight into the loving arms of god ."
my bedroom looks like a teenagers room ; or atleast like mine when i was a teenager ... <UNK> through clothes in various piles of <UNK> organization ...
"i 'm having trouble really wanting to put away , make pretty .... too much moving ."
"but this morning , i do n't care ."
"if you do n't take some guilt free time "" off "" , life is just too hard ."
how can i ask my daughters to do what i do n't feel like doing ?
their rooms are a <UNK> bit better than mine ...

ok so this has been a weird week .
and now i 'm getting a cold and hopped on on cold meds - so it 's a good time to talk about it right .
i talked to him for a couple of hours last night .
and i had all but forgotten how to flirt .
it 's good to know i still know how ...
might actually come in handy for real <#> day .
the coffee is n't ready at work - but the internet radio just played al green . and life could be worse .
so here 's my link for the day - cause it makes me laugh . and will make todd insane urllink <UNK> and check out ..
but i have noticed that i 've been on the phone like a <#> year old lately .
ok fast forward to this morning .... get up a minute or <#> late - no <UNK> - but i was still way tired
. luckily for me - it was still <UNK> <#> .. and i managed to avoid too much neighborhood interaction .
now i have to see if the coffee has been made yet - and if not ... kill people !
that read almost - i did nt ' hit anyone ... yet )
so then i turned on a local radio station and check this .
"they were talking to women , local atlanta women , who were writing love letters ( and meaning it ) to scott <UNK> ."
"this woman on the radio "" emily "" kept saying how someone was innocent until proven guilty in this county .... ok that 's true ... but come on !"
"ok , <#> - you 're looking at someone on tv ."
"that 's like me saying when kevin <UNK> acts on screen , he 's acting straight to me ..."
um ... someones <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> .... .
then started talking about how attractive he was .
"this man is accused of killing his wife and <UNK> baby ... in <UNK> world , you lose cute points for that ."
not in the de plane de plane way ... but in some ways a fantasy nonetheless .
"every once in a while , this girl needs an island day ..."
"these days can be even better when you have someone to nap and <UNK> with , but today i had to be content with the dog ."
"at this moment however , i 'm suffering the after effects of the <UNK> day - serious cabin fever ."
"but i have an awsome dog and access to ice cream , so i think i 'll survive another day ."
so last night a friend of mine had a <UNK> birthday party .
"either way - if you 're in atlanta , i <UNK> the <UNK> area ... but i digress ..."
".. so we get there <UNK> climb up about <#> stairs to this "" party room "" that 's attached to a bar downstairs ."
dear readers ( both of you ) i have <#> words ...
no air conditioning .... and a few more words ....
"there 's a band downstairs warming up right underneath us - so there 's the whole "" our "" music competing for "" their "" music ."
just wish there was a boy there saying such things - but whatever .... .
so she was <UNK> ... and that 's cool - she was thrilled to see her friends from college there .... then the music started - loud .
this is where i realized i 'm too old .
i was starting to be real ready to go and do something else .... so us being us .... what did we do ? ?
a little veggie sushi is good for whatever <UNK> ya .
then i headed back home to mike .... listening to al green all the way ....
maybe i 'll find that guy at the next party .
"ok , so this didn’t happen to me but <UNK> it ’s funny ."
"no wait that ’s too obvious , let ’s call her “ ms ."
"( ok we all know i stole that from dusty , but it ’s funny –"
is waiting with her son for his bus ( btw – he just started kindergarten –
"i can’t believe that <UNK> anyway <UNK> <UNK> it ’s actually cool outside here in the morning today … prolly due to the hurricane , but whatever –"
"so this morning the wee child says something along the lines of “ mommy i’m cold ” … to where ann , er ms <UNK> replies …"
i know it is cool outside <UNK> child <UNK> “ i have <UNK> all over my legs <UNK> and points to mom ’s <UNK> and says …
you’ve got those <UNK> ” or something like that .
prolly on advise from jerry <UNK> or some other <UNK> .
i also liked the <UNK> in the <UNK> where the girl is <UNK> a bible at someone yelling “
i am filled with the love of christ ” …
"i don’t know why , but damn that cracks me up ."
"so like to hear it , here it goes <UNK>"
. <#> . along those lines i have an <UNK> love of hair color .
in high school it <UNK> itself in <UNK> of <UNK> possible .
"from cherry red , to hot pink , to <UNK> . now that i’m in my <#> ’s the love is still there –"
the color choices just <UNK> i’m sporting a dark dark brown ( <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ) <#> .
i have a full on girl crush on <UNK> <UNK> .
i have pictures to prove it … but that ’s another story for another day <#> .
i am prone to fall in love really easily with many things <UNK>
"right now i’m in love with <UNK> <UNK> , justin <UNK> , <UNK> , stacey"
", stacey 's brother - he 's hot i tell you hot - and sounds like a sexy <UNK> on the phone !"
"<UNK> , mike , sleeping in , comfortable <UNK> , and other <UNK> i 'm not ready to mention in print yet ."
i have a purse <UNK> that i’m working on <UNK> .
a nail polish <UNK> i have no plans on <UNK> <#> .
and i’m funnier than <UNK> he knows who he is !
the peanut will be back on the 15th <UNK> it wrong that i’ve sorta missed him …
i think i’ve never actually been “ in ” love before –
loved often but not the permanent <#> <#> .
i wear almost all black all the time <#> .
i’ve given all my <UNK> away except <#> … ( the big <#> of course ) <#> .
i have a sock monkey who has an outfit that matches my parade outfit !
"i 'm driving home from a very "" challenging "" job ."
but i 've had <#> training and have been thrown to the wolves in it ... but that 's another story .
"anyway , long ass day - i 'm finally on my way home ..."
"i wanted to ask toby , "" does that often work "" ?"
( for my stories .... most of the moron 's are going to be named toby .... .
"i want to know a. what kind of man really does things like that - did they learn nothing from calling <UNK> and <UNK> "" <UNK> "" ?"
what kind of woman would then show him said <UNK> ?
now those who know me know i 'm not opposed to the flash - i find <UNK> fun and when unexpected hysterical ...
so i 'm not asking this from a <UNK> stand point ...
"i think i 'm gonna make a sign that says "" show me your ..."
"well show me nothing - get off the goddamn phone and drive """
.... if you know either a. what song that line is from or b. who sings that song - i will kiss you full on the mouth .
it was <#> of the <UNK> things i 've ever done -
but i feel better for just having done it .
i just hope it does n't effect my ability to rant ... cause damnit - i 'm really really good at that .
so i 'm on my lunch hour at work - sitting at my desk listening to al green and eating the spicy cheese its .
started with van <UNK> - cause it was all <UNK> and dark - perfect for <UNK> honey and into the <UNK> ....
i managed to actually have an umbrella in the car when i had to park <#> miles away from the office .... .
this weekend i 'm going to a <UNK> birthday party for a friend of mine that 's turning <#> ... and it 's at a <UNK> bar .
i 'm having posting issues - but if i have anything really profound or funny to say - i 'll start calling people and letting you know ! !
"it seems that even when things are their <UNK> , i 'm still <#> funny <UNK> ."
i make her <UNK> with laughter so i knew my work was done .
"well , those were n't the words that were used - but the message was the same .... ."
last night was better than the night before - even though it still included crying on the phone to the west virginia <UNK> .
but my beloved friends talked me down from the tree and made sure i was ok ....
"it was sweet , she asked if i was "" safe "" and i assure her i was much more <UNK> than suicidal ...."
i knew if i could still make a joke - we 'd all be ok for <#> more night .
i love all of you - and still ca n't wait for the under the sweater action from you .
ie - who care 's if someone is gay or not .
i was witness to a discussion today about homosexuality and it still sorta <UNK> me .
"i can understand <UNK> , <UNK> , even to some extent racism in the "" older "" generation - but when it 's people my age - ish ..."
i come from the school of thought of why the hell would i care if someone is gay - i 'm not .
but why would they care if i 'm not ? ?
"is their love or emotion or joy any less "" valid "" than mine - cause i happen to dig the men ?"
and my follow up to that is who cares ?
like my stance on abortion - if you 're against it do nt ' have <#> ...
i do n't understand the logic behind even the question ... and people like to throw the whole bible thing in there to state their case .
now using the bible as a weapon of judgement and hate is a good way to piss this girl off .
i do n't need someone else to act as a go between me and god ... nor does anyone else ....
i know this is <UNK> - but <UNK> - this is my blog and i can say what i want to .... i guess long story short -
ever have that day where even van <UNK> and a good cup of coffee ca n't make you happy ?
i have finally come to the place where i can admit that i have a problem with depression and i 'm gonna do something about it .
the past <#> months or so have been the worst ever <UNK> it 's time to go about turning that around .
i 'm not exactly sure what that is going to look like .
i 've considered selling my house and finding another job in another town and getting out of dodge .
"i 've considered going back to school for something way different than social services , i 'm considering becoming that size <#> alcoholic i always knew i could be ."
"but what i do know , is that i ca n't feel like this anymore ."
i ca n't feel alone every moment of the day .
"i ca n't be sad doing things that used to make me happy , i ca n't <UNK> my happiness for someone else 's anymore ."
and i ca n't wait for other people to approve for me to do what 's right for me .
i 'm tired of doing everything to please everyone else but me .
tired of saying yes when i want to scream no .
tired of doing something cause it will please someone else when all i want to do is be alone .
tired of being alone when all i want to do is be with someone else .
tired of not being comfortable in my own skin or happy in my own house .
but maybe with therapy and <UNK> - i can find the happy <UNK> again .
there are few things that <UNK> the <UNK> joy of waking up when you are good and goddamn ready to .
"i mean not having the dog wake you up , not the phone , nor the alarm"
... just you going <UNK> - it 's time to get up .
"so <UNK> a completly different topic , i was thinking about this whole blog thing today ."
is it wrong that at first the only question was did he set himself on fire with his crack pipe ?
"of course i ask this on the heels of <#> of those <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> ( the joey with <UNK> , thanks for asking )"
so everything is getting a little bit slower of a reaction time than originally <UNK> .
i 'm sure my compassion will work it 's way around soon .
could be cool - but i 'm gonna need mas beers to think this <#> thru .
"ok , so i have several dear friends that do this blog or diary thing where they post their <UNK> thoughts and then ask for comments on them ."
i 'm not sure that i 'm the girl for that - since i welcome criticism about as much as the <UNK> <UNK> free thought .
... so i 'll be back - after a trip to <UNK> 's !
paul of <UNK> practiced guitar this morning until my <UNK> broke .
black hills jack gave me a guided tour of <UNK> .
i was a little disappointed that the original <UNK> ’s town is now a <UNK> canyon .
the town that is now <UNK> is kind of a <UNK> - wannabe .
"a row of small <UNK> in <UNK> buildings , it just doesn’t do much spiritually . <UNK> to the seth <UNK> <UNK> on mt ."
drove up <UNK> canyon and walked across the field where the final scene of dances with wolves was filmed .
lots of <UNK> plants grow <UNK> <UNK> and choke cherry .
still a few bikes around from the <UNK> rally .
kind of glad the timing let me miss the crowds of hot august nights in <UNK> and the <UNK> rally here .
seeing the great <UNK> and the black hills for the first time brings a constant sense of wonder and appreciation .
"the beautiful people who have lived here for thousands of years , developing spiritual <UNK> based on <UNK> <UNK> of the divine in nature ."
it always <UNK> me as a kid to read bible stories about <UNK> trees and olive <UNK> couldn’t relate to them until i lived in california .
- black hills jack said goodbye to black hills jack this morning .
i told him that i truly appreciated the generous <UNK> and especially the great conversations .
i told him that i was <UNK> by the huge <UNK> in his life for me .
"he smiled and teased me saying , “ well , i was raised roman catholic and of course we are taught to suffer ."
i hope i see him again in this lifetime .
"stopped at the gas station in pine ridge , where it seemed just about everyone in town has lunch ."
a round building there <UNK> the american indian movement .
"i found an fm radio station out of mission , <UNK> that played only indian artists ."
they played an enjoyable little <UNK> song that i liked .
turns out the artist is a woman from round valley ( <UNK> ) california .
i may have to look her up next time i’m in <UNK> county .
mary is on a spiritual retreat with several women with whom she went to <UNK> .
our dinner was <UNK> paid by a member of the <UNK> ’s family .
louis to develop a new type of alternative energy .
i’m hoping he will have time to get started on the recording this week .
in the early <#> ’s the prophet sweet medicine lived several years in the bear <UNK> .
"upon his return , he delivered to the <UNK> people the way in which the people would <UNK> a legal system , code of ethics , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"he brought with him <#> medicine <UNK> a <UNK> of sacred <UNK> , the other a medicine hat <UNK> ."
<UNK> black hills jack wil and ron told me that bear <UNK> was an important place to visit on this <UNK> .
they both simply told me that the <UNK> is a sacred place .
what they didn’t tell me is that bear <UNK> is an american mt .
"the <UNK> trees are filled with prayer <UNK> and tobacco ties , so it is a colorful hike up the hill ."
"from the top of the <UNK> , you can see <#> states ."
i want to climb the <UNK> on my return trip to california .
i felt a strong presence of the holy there .
"on my birthday , <#> years ago , george a. <UNK> walked on bear <UNK> as part of his science <UNK> ."
"strong winds today , so my offering of tobacco was quickly carried away ."
i noticed a sign that says human remains and ashes are not to be left on the <UNK> .
my wife had a dream about the <#> of us in a precious place in the <UNK> .
i think i need to bring her here someday .
pretty sure this could be that precious place .
jack and i also stopped at a us <UNK> <UNK> children buried there .
some of the most beautiful buildings are homes made of stone built by german <UNK> during <UNK> ii .
he has wonderful <UNK> of all sorts hanging on his walls .
<#> wall is completely covered with crosses and <UNK> of many cultures .
each piece has a story that bill tells well .
he took us to the sugar <UNK> for “ the best <UNK> in the hills ” .
"the place really is a <UNK> , and the burgers really are quite good ."
"jack woke up at 4:30 this morning , so he had a long wait until i showered and appeared around <#> am ."
"he immediately called bill and said , “ the bear has emerged from his cave ! ”"
"last night a dinner , a gay waiter asked bill where jack found “ that <UNK> of a bear !"
i have a feeling that i will be referred to as “ the bear ” for the rest of my stay in the black hills .
bill worked for the <UNK> for years as a high school english teacher at <UNK> river indian <UNK> in eagle <UNK> .
"both he and jack have <UNK> knowledge of the <UNK> people , so it is easy to simply sit and listen to the stories and be fascinated ."
so i spent some quality time with my guitar .
i need to practice hard on saturday to prepare for sunday morning worship services .
"when jack awoke , we took a drive to catch a peek at mt ."
"<UNK> and crazy horse mountain . enjoyed a light dinner in <UNK> , <UNK> at the purple pie <UNK> place to <UNK> ."
tomorrow will be my last day in the black hills .
we plan to visit <UNK> entire town is a historical <UNK> .
jack continues to tell wonderful <UNK> entertaining is the story of the night kevin <UNK> stayed here .
"jack points to the couch and says , “ he slept right here ”"
"then hold up a pair of white <UNK> shorts and says , “ and he wore these while he did his laundry ."
” he really enjoyed his time creating <UNK> for the dances with wolves movie .
"<#> mess <UNK> hand in the living room along with a hand drum , <UNK> , <UNK> and paintings ."
"my favorite is a <UNK> - style last supper with jesus and the <#> wrapped inn colorful blankets , some with cloth <UNK> ."
they are all standing and looking very <UNK> with their faces surrounded by <UNK> .
remember the <UNK> and keep it holy . —
law of <UNK> yesterday was a day of rest and not driving .
"especially enjoyed browsing at the <UNK> edge <UNK> huge , beautiful building full of high end <UNK> art ."
"gorgeous buffalo <UNK> , dance clothes , paintings , <UNK> , rare <UNK> wonderful ."
rapid city has bronze <UNK> of american presidents <UNK> at every street corner .
i especially liked ronald reagan in cowboy <UNK> and jimmy carter with his jacket over his shoulder smiling and waving .
today i arrived at black hills jack ’s home .
he immediately made me feel right at home and we enjoyed several hours of good conversation before joining his friend bill for dinner at a very nice italian restaurant .
jack also welcomed me with a gift of a <UNK> cross to wear with my <UNK> .
we plan to visit bear <UNK> tomorrow and to take a <UNK> at the crazy horse <UNK> .
"wil and ron , friends of mine from cleveland encouraged me to visit black hills jack and also to visit bear <UNK> ."
many people consider the <UNK> a sacred place .
"my favorite guitar player , wayne <UNK> is having health problems and can not travel by plane ."
lewis and i were hoping we could fly him up to <UNK> to do a session for the new project .
"wayne is , however , planning to visit his son in indiana , so a car trip may be possible soon ."
"because of this , i may have to begin work in <UNK> next week and then travel back for <UNK> fair the following weekend ."
"if that is what it takes to get wayne ’s contribution on the recording , then it will be worth it ."
black hills jack owns a crystal cave a little ways from here .
i’ll probably walk over and take a look at it tomorrow morning .
jack told me several great stories i had never heard before about good friends of mine .
we were both amazed at how many people we both know from ohio and pennsylvania .
"big dinner , good music , lots of stories to <UNK> i’m pretty tired ."
the evolution of the world is a great <UNK> of god .
"not only am i a part of this <UNK> network , but i am and <UNK> part ."
"it is not only theology that teaches me this , but it is the truth that <UNK> shout from the <UNK> ."
every living creature is an essential part of the whole .
<UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> thanks for the quote dr .
i realized this morning that i spent a good chunk of this weekend in the company of really fine men and women .
big feast last night followed by <UNK> and round dancing late into the night .
john <UNK> and i were chatting a couple days ago
and i asked him if <UNK> ’s coffee ( my personal favorite roast ) had any <UNK> in los angeles .
"he laughed and said , “ let me go <UNK> you a cup ” ."
he brought a pound of <UNK> to the <UNK> !
"john and lisa , the <UNK> of <UNK> are not far from the realm of god ."
"uncle frank and stood near <#> <UNK> canvas white , the other shades of dark gray ."
i read that <UNK> warriors <UNK> in dark <UNK> .
"so i asked frank , “ is that <UNK> for <UNK> ? ”"
i think that <UNK> was bought from the dances with wolves movie set .
the set <UNK> dyed the canvas to get the right <UNK> .
” frank is a man who knows many things .
"on the <UNK> <UNK> , sunday morning worship is still “"
<UNK> people attend roman catholic and <UNK> churches while <UNK> attend <UNK> and <UNK> .
francis catholic church is being <UNK> for sexual <UNK> by a priest .
i joined about a dozen <UNK> in the <UNK> to hear pastor jackie moon preach .
very kind and welcoming people at the united <UNK> church in mission .
david from italy rode with me from mission to rapid city .
i arrived at <UNK> and <UNK> ’s house as david just finished <UNK> an interview with <UNK> <UNK> .
we all sat around the <UNK> dining room table searching for something worthy of saying when you know you won’t see each other for a long time .
and so we broke a lengthy silence with laughter .
first stop was <#> town home of the horse cisco that kevin <UNK> rode in dances with wolves .
they have a large collection of dances with wolves items on display .
the <UNK> was the same color as the <#> at the <UNK> .
david from italy and i ate dinner at a <UNK> place recommended by <UNK> and <UNK> .
"as soon as david ’s bus <UNK> , i went to my room to take a hot shower , write this blog entry and begin some serious sleep time ."
"yes , god is <#> but it is very complicated ."
we will watch over you as you <UNK> your knowledge .
most of my birthdays have been spent entirely outdoors .
i opened my eyes this morning to the sound of calvin jumping bull over the loud speakers and i <UNK> when i heard the drum .
ate a couple of hot dogs at the <UNK> <UNK> breakfast then remembered i was supposed to sweat at <#> am .
you don’t want to eat just prior to a sweat .
i danced hard throughout the second <UNK> session of the day so that i might <UNK> those <UNK> before the decorated the hot rocks .
david from italy decided that he would leave the <UNK> and stay at the <UNK> house .
he wanted to spend the afternoon <UNK> an interview with <UNK> <UNK> .
"david said his goodbyes ( <UNK> ) to the camp and we drove past the <UNK> dogs and <UNK> from the <UNK> horse looking , <UNK> ."
<UNK> was waiting for us in the sweat <UNK> .
dana is <UNK> with the <UNK> nation in montana .
the <UNK> are the only nation to pierce at the <UNK> .
"the <UNK> , according to dana , have a <UNK> that is very much an <UNK> event ."
he said the <UNK> is really hard to accomplish .
<UNK> passed an impressive pile of hot rocks into the sweat <UNK> .
enjoyed my first shower in <#> days under a garden hose .
<UNK> served up quite a feast featuring chili <UNK> .
several of <UNK> and <UNK> ’s friends joined us for a green chili feast and a wonderful conversation .
<UNK> called a friend who <UNK> a nearby <UNK> church to find out what time services start tomorrow morning .
i plan to worship there before driving with david from italy to rapid city .
"returned birthday <UNK> from my sister , my lawyer <UNK> and my wife ."
"she is <UNK> her career , her children and her <UNK> with the same predictable <UNK> as life generally <UNK> to her ."
<#> of the better gifts i can give to her is not let myself be another time investment to <UNK> .
"after all , she is the <#> who is going to have to hear all the <UNK> essays i deliver on “"
i felt very relaxed today and spent most of the afternoon dancing near the <UNK> or sitting and listening to the <UNK> conversations at the camp .
calvin teased me again about my notebook and i told him i was only writing down the jokes that were really funny ...
so i didn’t have much to write thus far .
i did write a general observation about what it feels like to be <#> years old .
— <UNK> <#> the cook ’s cabin keeps <UNK> out the meals to feed all the people .
i sat with francis bird after eating breakfast this morning under the canvas <UNK> that cover the picnic table area .
i heal the blind using the lord ’s tears .
” francis bird tells the story of healing a blind man named charlie holy bible .
francis used the lord ’s tears to heal him .
this afternoon i sat across the table from <UNK> .
"he said , “ dan , dan , <UNK> you know these things ."
let me ask <UNK> are you still a christian ? ”
i laughed and gave him an answer similar to <#> given by <UNK> <UNK> jan <UNK> when she was asked the same question but
i added that the christ in people i knew gave me great strength in my darkest hour .
"returning to camp , i sat next to new mexico david ."
"a good guy to have around , david will make sure you do things correctly when approaching the ritual ."
he brought his brother dan and his <#> sons to the <UNK> .
i sat next to him and noticed a boy carrying a large puppy towards the fire pit .
i had heard that <UNK> warriors will <UNK> a puppy then boil it .
a real <UNK> can fish the dog ’s skull from the boiling water .
<UNK> and i stood still as we received blessings from the dancers .
"at the end of the healing ritual , <UNK> whispers to me , “"
now we go from the good to the bad .
” the drum <UNK> in speed and volume and a new song was sung .
"as the <UNK> stood in a circle , the <UNK> danced wildly ."
the dog skull was held out for all to see .
<#> <UNK> in black and white paint suddenly became a face i recognized .
""" quality is the continuing <UNK> which causes us to create the world in which we live ."
"it is the track that <UNK> the train . """
— robert m. <UNK> - zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance very cold last night in the lower <UNK> needed all <#> blankets .
some of the <UNK> are <UNK> even though they <UNK> this morning prior to the first dance session .
i am amazed more by the <UNK> factor of dancing all day than the piercings .
i am also amazed at the <UNK> sing <#> song that lasts for the entire dance session .
some of these sessions last up to <#> hours !
the driveway runs through a couple dozen <UNK> homes used by the school staff .
"when you face west , you can see a light purple <UNK> <UNK> the playground and tennis courts ."
i tried to enter the <UNK> but it was locked .
i couldn’t find a priest anywhere on the campus .
part of the campus is the <UNK> memorial <UNK> museum named after the <UNK> priest eugene <UNK> .
he came to south dakota from holland in <#> to minister to the people who gave him the name “ black eagle ” .
"during his <#> years with the <UNK> , he published <#> books in <UNK> language ."
"after his death , his <UNK> of almost <#> words were <UNK> and published in a <UNK> - english dictionary ."
"in <#> , the museum was built to celebrate the <UNK> anniversary of <UNK> as a <UNK> ."
most of the displays are from his collection including a fully - <UNK> <UNK> cap for an infant and <#> sets of ghost dance clothes .
"i watched another round of piercing today standing next to a fellow equal to my size from <UNK> , florida ."
some of the dancers were suspended from the tree by the chest piercings .
<#> dancer hung for quite some time <UNK> <#> wing fans as if he was flying .
little thunder was a great leader of the <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> bear ’s death .
as immigrants traveling to montana and california they passed through <UNK> hunting <UNK> .
<UNK> with little thunder ’s security guards would lead to the <UNK> wars .
"sadly , that is still about <#> years passed the average <UNK> for a <UNK> indian man ."
<UNK> bird sat at the end of our camp table slowly smoking a cigarette and staring at me .
he seemed to be under the influence of something .
"after he left , <UNK> told me that i needed to talk to him before the <UNK> is over . according to <UNK>"
you can’t do anything in life if it doesn’t have meaning .
the <UNK> tree represents the creator that gives us life on the earth .
i don’t trust people who write in <UNK> all of the time .
calvin jumping bull <UNK> left hand bull brought a group of about <#> air force medical <UNK> here to study alternative medicine .
the dancers enter and exit from the west entrance to the <UNK> into a pine covered <UNK> .
it is quite a sight to see them emerge .
we are not to cross the <UNK> <UNK> .
"at the end of each session , some of the dancer ’s <UNK> are handed to individuals outside the <UNK> ."
the <UNK> <UNK> the pipe and takes it to a group and they smoke it .
david handed me a pipe and the bowl fell off .
"we were being careful , but i felt terrible about it ."
although i wasn’t blamed for the incident ( thanks be to god )
i was extra <UNK> about handling any pipe handed to me for the rest of the <UNK> .
pipe wisdom ; store your pipe away from your home .
"when you fill the pipe you start by facing the west , then north , east , south , up , down and to the great mystery ."
no animals should be around when you fill the pipe .
you plug the tobacco with a <UNK> of <UNK> .
"when you light the pipe , remove the <UNK> plug first ."
"frank said , “ when you handle a pipe it ’s like handling a loaded gun ."
"you hand it to another with the stem facing straight up , not pointing towards another human being ."
men are pierced either on the chest or back .
<#> slices with either an eagle <UNK> or a <UNK> then a small piece of wood the size of a <UNK> rod is <UNK> between .
"ted <UNK> , the man who made the teasing signs for <UNK> and calvin dragged <#> buffalo <UNK> from his back piercings ."
"david , from italy , got a call that the <UNK> found his luggage and sent it to the <UNK> house ."
uncle frank asked me to give david a ride to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ’s home on the other side of the town of <UNK> .
david and i had a great conversation on the <UNK> wrote his graduate thesis on the <UNK> for a university in <UNK> .
<UNK> is the director of economic development for the <UNK> nation .
"he is currently making plans to build a full service truck stop next to the <UNK> casino , but like many development projects there is some political opposition ."
i <UNK> immediately that he is a deeply spiritual man .
he works <UNK> as a private <UNK> some pretty famous <UNK> .
i asked him if the churches were doing anything productive on the <UNK> and sadly he couldn’t think of anything .
"he grew up on the pine ridge <UNK> which has many roman catholic and <UNK> communities , but he said the people are returning to the traditional spiritual practices ."
he said that the <UNK> and roman <UNK> need to come up with <UNK> as inviting as the <UNK> .
had a dinner of buffalo and chicken with a side of fresh <UNK> .
they invited david and i to sweat with them on saturday at <#> am .
i am very thankful that frank sent me to visit with the <UNK> .
white buffalo <UNK> woman came from god and brought the sacred pipe and rules for the <UNK> .
you do not change the ceremony god has given us .
"” — uncle frank red and yellow , black and white ."
it is <#> am and already so much has happened i can’t write it all down .
at <#> am the <UNK> were singing and a truck drove through camp <UNK> it ’s horn .
"i heard the chief loudly ask , “ what ’s the <UNK> ?"
soon calvin jumping bull was on the microphone telling us that it was time to get up .
"a very nice man from <UNK> , montana told me that my coat looks like <#> roger <UNK> used to wear ."
i told him that roger gave me the coat before he died .
"just as the eastern sky lit up , the drum fired up ."
<#> men and <#> women danced in single file into the east entrance of the <UNK> .
the <UNK> was moved and the # <#> tin cans with <UNK> were <UNK> the dancers .
the <UNK> was replaced after all the dancers entered .
it was quite a <UNK> red clothing and the magnificent tree of many colors .
"they were all bare <UNK> wearing <UNK> , mostly red ."
about half of the men had scars on their <UNK> and backs from previous <UNK> .
<UNK> wrapped in red cloth were worn as <UNK> and <UNK> .
about half of the men had <#> <UNK> sticking up from the <UNK> <UNK> .
the women wore <UNK> <UNK> also that looked like <UNK> .
the dancers all sleep in the same area near the sweat <UNK> .
i believe they <UNK> just prior to this morning ’s dance session .
uncle frank gave this explanation : “ do not touch the dancers .
contacted to the mother earth and to the father through the tree .
they will bring balance to the earth for <#> more year .
"only the leaders can touch the dancers , but we would rather wait to shake your hands until sunday at the end of the <UNK> ."
you do not change the ceremony god has given us .
"i know some of you won’t like this , but we sing the same songs , <UNK> , same songs . ”"
"i gave <UNK> left hand bull , the lead singer for the drum an <UNK> shell wrapped in sweet grass and filled with cough drops ."
the dancers blew eagle bone <UNK> and many had <UNK> with eagle heads on top .
they danced around the <UNK> of the circle then would <UNK> move to the center and touch the tree .
small groups of the dancers would move again to the center and touch the tree and pray .
<#> man got on his knees and was moving in a circle with keith in a <UNK> walking around him and leading him .
they stopped and raised their hands to each of the <#> directions .
"a <UNK> man standing next to me said , “ i bet you are wondering why that man is on his knees ” “"
” “ he had a dream of being a buffalo .
"” i asked , “ have you ever <UNK> ?"
"” he started <UNK> his shirt as if to show me the scars on his chest then he <UNK> <UNK> and said , “ never have ."
i’ve been taught that you have to have the dream first .
it can take <#> years of <UNK> to get that dream .
"” i asked , “ should you tell someone else your dream ?"
"” “ you can ” , he said , “ but it is better to write it down ."
"if you tell someone , it should be someone you really trust ."
"the sign at the entrance to camp reads : the holy circle <UNK> <UNK> horse looking , <UNK> ."
"this is a <UNK> day , but everyone is in good spirits ."
fill bucket <#> cents per glass the <UNK> springs singers are <UNK> a flag song now .
"found uncle frank who smiled and said , “ dan , i was worried that you weren’t going to make it ."
frank introduced me to a fellow named john <UNK> .
"my friend mike <UNK> from athens , ohio told me several times about john and that i should look him up whenever i was in southern california ."
"john <UNK> me to his father - in - law carl <UNK> , a <UNK> <UNK> went to <UNK> with my friend from <UNK> bay <UNK> <UNK> ."
as the people say here “ we are all related ” .
"as i was getting <UNK> with the group sitting around a picnic table , chief calvin jumping bull looked up and said , “ the tree is here ” ."
at the top of the hill came a huge <UNK> tree being carried by <#> or so <UNK> and women .
<#> young men in <UNK> <UNK> walked in front of the tree along with <UNK> arena director .
several women were carrying # <#> tin cans attached to cut off <UNK> <UNK> .
some of the cans were filled with burning <UNK> .
the tree was carried to the center of the dance <UNK> .
the entrance to the <UNK> was a road of fresh <UNK> that runs around the inner <UNK> of the <UNK> .
the <UNK> took off their shoes and as each entered the <UNK> they raised their hands into the air and spun around .
"they all did that on the way out of the <UNK> , too ."
<UNK> were tied to the top of the <UNK> tree .
<UNK> <UNK> the people ’s prayers were tied to the branches .
"red , black , white and yellow <UNK> were wrapped around the trunk of the tree to <UNK> the <#> directions ."
the tree was especially chosen because it had a fork .
it <UNK> a human being lifting up his/her arms in prayer .
<#> drum sang a long song as the people brought the tree to the <UNK> .
another drum sang a long song as the tree was prepared and raised .
"following the tree raising came a wonderful dinner with several <UNK> , and hot pie filling served like choke cherry pudding ."
boxes of clothes were laid out for people who wanted them .
"it was a good thing because a young man named david came here from a small town near <UNK> , italy and the <UNK> lost his luggage ."
he has a garbage bag full of clothes to get him through the week .
i took a nap in my <UNK> to my friend jackie burns <UNK> me an excellent air mattress .
"the part about the <UNK> is true , but i strongly doubt there was a buffalo <UNK> with my name on it ."
a fellow from <UNK> named <UNK> walked up to me and asked if i had a <UNK> .
he lost the key to his <UNK> van and needed to get home
i <UNK> out a big <UNK> from my van and we searched for about a half an hour .
<#> woman told <UNK> that some kids found a key and it was supposed to be taken to uncle frank .
"as i spent most of the evening in a short - <UNK> cotton shirt , i saw many people with heavy <UNK> <UNK> ."
i let a few folks borrow blankets from me .
there are <#> sweat <UNK> set up near the <UNK> with a huge pit for a huge fire .
they had over <#> stones baking today but i haven’t seen anyone using the sweat <UNK> tonight .
"since there are no shower facilities here , i’m pretty sure i’ll be doing a sweat or <#> before the week is over ."
"uncle frank introduce me to a few folks by saying , “ this is dan ."
"he is a christian minister , but he <UNK> ."
” tomorrow frank and calvin will fire up the pa system at <#> am to wake us up to celebrate the sunrise and the dancers will begin the ordeal .
they were not to touch water after noon <UNK> drink or wash in it .
water is the source of life and the dancers have committed themselves to give up their lives to god this week .
day <#> christian leaders can not simply be persons who have well - informed opinions about the burning issues of our time .
— <UNK> j. m. <UNK> visited mary ’s <UNK> and office this morning .
then off to see <#> of the <#> places where jc works .
my <UNK> <UNK> test to see whether or not i am still a worship nerd comes from the energy i get when i walk into a place of worship .
often i get a feeling of soul expansion at these moments .
i got a driving tour of the <UNK> and the <UNK> reservations .

the cost of a freshman tuition and board is about $ <#> — $ <#> less than my <UNK> <UNK> charges currently .
at the top of the hill sits a memorial to black <UNK> .
john <UNK> the poet who had long conversations with the <UNK> holy man and <UNK> “ black <UNK> speaks ” lived in this area .

"a fine <UNK> , a fine man and i’m pretty sure he is a <UNK> too ."
"” instantly scott <UNK> - <UNK> grabbed my hand and said , “ dan paul , how is pacific <UNK> ?"
"sadly , it took me until the middle of the worship service to recall how i knew scott ."
<UNK> and i invite <UNK> to stay in our home during the annual meeting in pacific <UNK> .
after the service we had a little time to have a real conversation .
got to chat with <UNK> a bit as well .

"as i was walking back to my van for the drive to jc and mary ’s house in wayne , <UNK> i shook hands again with tom <UNK> ."

"the music was very white bread , but performed with <UNK> and extraordinary <UNK> ."
there are <#> visitor ’s centers on the <UNK> at the north gate and <#> at the south .
the north gate center houses a model of the ancient jerusalem temple .
i tried to convert a <UNK> <UNK> to become a <UNK> of christ but failed .
:-) the south gate center seems to be focused on <UNK> family <UNK> driving home the “ god <UNK> ”
<#> large sign claims to have words supporting the family by the savior .

"to completely <UNK> the reason , let ’s just say i was depressed over a girl ."
once i had a fairly steady calendar i only worked <#> hours a day .
"this <UNK> has nothing to do with depression , in fact i believe i accomplished something <UNK> <UNK> told <UNK> “"
the secret to <UNK> is taking it before you absolutely need it ” .
"i feel pretty good these days for a <#> - <#> - pound , middle - aged white guy ."
i’ve been sitting in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in downtown <UNK> trying to figure out how to connect this laptop computer to the wireless <UNK> they <UNK> here .

"<#> good friend , pat bruce offered to buy me breakfast here — he ’s not here right now , but he works here ."
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sits above a wine store decorated with competitive <UNK> <UNK> .
gore - <UNK> shirts framed and signed fill the walls and <UNK> jazz plays loudly over the stereo system .
"as long as my hair is getting , i have the <UNK> hair in the room ."

steve is an <UNK> <UNK> minister who was a fellow student at capital university with me <#> <#> years ago .

i hoping steve can lay down some hammer <UNK> tracks over the weekend to use on the new album .
<#> of steve ’s best friends owns a studio in ft .
<UNK> that should have everything we need to do the job .
this evening i will be dining at colin and <UNK> ’s house .

he has a steady gig <UNK> <UNK> up to the constant winds of <UNK> heat .

we were comparing notes yesterday afternoon about having a profession that <UNK> a lot of close relationships .
my <UNK> with the christian church <UNK> me this <#> month period at the end of every <#> years of service as it ’s pastor .
"when i earned the masters of <UNK> from the pacific school of religion in <#> , i asked some elder <UNK> to mentor me ."
"most of them strongly recommended that i request <UNK> <UNK> time and that no matter what is going on in the church , i take it ."
it evidently is a self - care issue .
i was working through my last semester of <UNK> studies and i didn’t have much time to think about what i needed to bring to the discussion .
"i contacted my regional minister and he said , “ did anyone tell you to insist on <UNK> time ?"
"it was a problem , because this delicate meeting discussing my salary , benefits , and other expectations was not <UNK> to the congregation ."
"they demanded , “ who told you that you would get that much time off ?"
thanks be to god cool heads <UNK> and the initial discussion was remembered .
the current board of elders wrote the <UNK> language into my fifth annual <UNK> .
i plan to collect wisdom about this question during the next <#> months .
steve <UNK> called today to say “ happy <UNK> ” .
steve was driving by a <UNK> church with god doesn’t take a vacation ! on the <UNK> .
i’ll take special note of wise people who give me their definitions of <UNK> in the next few months .
"i have a great person ( what are they called , teachers ?"
"she is the same <#> <#> of my friends have , both who have lost a lot of weight ."
i am hoping they will be a wonderful influence on me .
i decided that i will stick with it come what may .
"i know there will be times i will gain a few <UNK> , maybe even pounds ."
"times when i stay the same for weeks at a time , but i am going to stick with it ."
"sure , it is <#> a week , but really , what is that , <#> <UNK> ."
<#> <UNK> i should be bringing from home anyway .
"<#> <UNK> of gas , <#> <UNK> of milk , <#> package of <UNK> , i could go on and on ."
i have not done so much counting since 6th grade math .
i am heading to the store shortly where i will take my little chart with me and pick some low points food .
i want some good snacks around here for when i feel like i am not eating enough .
"those <UNK> points will be saved for mexico , because i can tell you , i might rather go without eating to have a <UNK> <UNK> in la <UNK> ."
"the problem is i do n't have just <#> , try <#> or <#> ."
it is hot down there ( okay not really )
but it is vacation and i have <#> kids !
"so check back every wednesday night , i will have an update after my meeting ."
i am hoping that having to post my <UNK> and gains here just might help a little bit every time i choose something to eat .
"maybe , just maybe , the next time you see me , you will see less of me ."
just in case this <#> ( which is our dream )

<UNK> and tori ( her cousin ) playing at the park .
are n't those <#> of the cutest girls you have ever seen ?
she will be starting the week i return to work .
but why does she have to be so big ?
"she is <#> and a half now , and i wonder where the time has gone . was n't she just born ?"
did n't we have her first birthday only a few months ago ?
"for the few moments we were there , she was already playing ."
"she will do find without mom and dad for the day , but will we ?"
i know there will come a day when she will not want to come home because she is having too much fun .
"we want her to have fun , fun , fun , but never so much she does n't yell "" mommy "" , "" daddy "" ."
"i know who this whole <UNK> thing is going to be hard on , us !"

"yes , that is us , the <UNK> 's with <#> players of the la galaxy ! chris <UNK> , # <#> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , # <#> , is holding <UNK> ."
when he went to pick her up i told him to be careful that she is heavy .
"there sitting on the couch in the luxury suite , was <UNK> 's very pregnant wife ."
she was really sweet when <UNK> went over and started talking to her .
"now , of course we are fans of the la galaxy !"
last night we attended a game that we did not <UNK> have tickets for .
"these seats for $ <#> included <#> general admission seats , <#> hot dogs and <#> <UNK> . what a deal !"
where else can you have fun with the whole family for that kind of price .
"the seats were pretty good too , behind the goal , and <#> sections to chose from ."
next season the <UNK> usa will be playing at the home depot center as well .
we hope that this might add to the fans not take away .
"if you ever want to attend a game with us , let us know ."
we are always happy to include someone else in the fun we have there .
"besides nothing is <UNK> then hearing <UNK> yell "" gal - x - ee , gal - x - ee "" , "" <UNK> ! """
"while driving in the car with her daddy , <UNK> told eric , "" green means go "" ."
"then he asked her what does red mean , she said "" stop "" ."
"then he said what does yellow mean , she did n't know ."
", she said "" i 'm not driving , i 'm good at the lights "" ."
"she always asks which direction we are turning , and every now and then gets it right ."
"( left , right , she has a <#> chance , really ) ."
"now it makes me wonder , is she really incredible , or just aware of everything around her ?"
"she is <#> years old , <#> months , and <#> days ."
"i guess eric was the same way when he was a kid , so maybe it is n't so amazing ."
"it could be that she has <#> adults talking to her all the time , not to mention her grandma ."
"whatever it is , i am amazed everyday with what she knows ."
"we are currently working on <UNK> training , i would like to have day time done before she goes to <UNK> late next month ."
"she loves her new <UNK> pull - ups , but the princess <#> 's make her happy too ."
i told her i will not buy her anymore <UNK> .
have you ever had a car that felt like an <UNK> of yourself ?
"as though the minute you sat in it , you were sitting inside yourself ?"
"and to be perfectly honest , i never knew that i could feel that way about a car ."
"a machine , something to get me from <#> place to another ."
"if <#> can love a car , i loved that car ."
i had never even heard of land <UNK> until eric said i should look into <#> so we could off - road .
"the minute i drove it , that was that ."
"i liked to look out the window and see it there in the drive , waiting to go on an <UNK> ."
"after work , it was as if a loved <#> was waiting there for me ."
"( go ahead and hit me , i probably wo n't even feel it ) ."
"now , do n't get me wrong , i loved that car ."
"but i saw it for what it was , a piece of shit ."
that car was in and out of the shop so many times .
"it would <UNK> , so i never got to use the air ."
the jump seat were only good in a pinch because there really is n't a lot of leg room back there .
"nothing was cheap to fix , no <#> had parts , it had to be someones <UNK> to work on that car ."
"it has been gone <#> months now , and sometimes , just sometimes , i forget i no longer have it ."
i knew i had to get rid of it .
we were expecting another baby and needed more room and more <UNK> .
"now i am driving a <UNK> <UNK> , and i have no complaints ."
"that van is great , especially for a van ."
"it fills all the needs that my family has , but it is not my disco ."
if we were going to buy another we would be able to make a wiser choice .
"i dream of having another , maybe when <UNK> and <UNK> are older and no longer go anywhere with us ."
in <UNK> for always taking care of me and my disco .
"little red disco , where ever you are , i miss you ."
i love the way i felt when i was driving you .
thank you for letting me know that someone can actually love a car .
i would n't have thought it was possible before you .
no <#> will ever be able to fill your leather seats like me !
"it has been wonderful to rent dvd 's online , pay no shipping or late fees and have them sent directly to your home ."
"we wait for those lovely red <UNK> to come , watch as soon as <UNK> possible so we can send it out and get another ."
we started with the <#> out at a time plan and we are now on the <#> out at a time .
"if you have never heard of <UNK> , or would like to know more , check it out ."
"they had that <#> day rental , then opened hollywood video which allowed <#> day <UNK> , what does blockbuster do , change policy ."
<UNK> opened ( years ago ) now blockbuster wants part of that too .
( do n't even get me started ) wants a piece too .
i guess it is easy to steal people 's ideas .
"( wal - mart seems to have "" borrowed "" something from itunes too ! ) ."
"is n't that what this country is all about , the american dream ."
you can be and do anything you want if you work hard enough .
"well , only if wal - mart or blockbuster or some other <UNK> huge company does n't want a piece of that action ."
i can only hope that <UNK> has built up enough devoted customers that do n't mind paying a mere few dollars more for excellent service .
is n't that what a return customer is all about ?
remember all the wonderful mom and pop stores ? me neither !
"check it out , <UNK> , and maybe you can see why we are so happy with it ."
how is it that it is now hotter then when the sun was <UNK> ? !
"if i were in <UNK> right now , it is only <#> degrees ."
"of course even if it were n't cooler because of the ocean , i would still be in <UNK> ."
"i could be here hot , or be in <UNK> hot ."
"hmmm , you decide which is better ! ! !"
"what do people who are home all day , do all day ?"
how many loads of laundry can <#> do before going nuts ?
i often have to check to find out what day it is .
"i like being lazy in the morning , eating a real breakfast sometimes , cleaning a little before i dress ."
"but really , have i come to be <#> of those people who values themselves because of the job they do ?"
am i only worth something when i go to work ?
i have no income so i am <UNK> on eric for money .
i actually had to ask for money to go shopping .
"( well not ask , but you know what i mean ) . and he is wonderful ."
he loves that i am home for an extended <UNK> leave to be with all the kids this summer .
he has not said anything about staying home all day and save money .
i think i blame the lack of complete happiness on my personality .
i am not the type of person who enjoys being by herself .
"i am enjoying my time home because it is limited , but frankly if i was a stay at home mom , what would i do ?"
"once the kids go back to school , what will that be like ?"
what does <#> do with <#> 's self all day at home ?
are most stay at home moms expected to have dinner on the table when the husband comes home ?
"( sorry eric , you know that wo n't happen ) ."
i often do n't even think of dinner until eric is home .
"should the house be <UNK> , lord help us if we are waiting for me to do it ."
"i realize my faults , i know i should do more ."
thank goodness i usually have the excuse of work .
"i know that i am loved and accepted no matter my faults , by those around me ."
"<UNK> , i feel as though i go on and on and do n't get anywhere ."
"i love my husband , i love my kids , and i love my dogs ."
"i love my life , i know i have it a lot easier then most ."
"i think , though , that i also love my job ."
"i do n't mean the job i do , i know i love that ."
"i did n't spend all those years of college to do something i do n't love , but i think i love who my job makes me ."
i love the person i am at work as well as at home .
"i would like more time at home , but i do n't think i could ever give up my job ."
are n't i <UNK> to want to be home with them all the time ?
that working mothers only work because they have to ?
"maybe i do n't have to , but i sure like to most of the time ."
"well , i think diego might have fallen back asleep ."
"i think i will go climb in bed and hold <UNK> very close to me , smell her , and give her a <#> kisses ."
"today , he <UNK> <#> pounds and <#> oz ."
"he is as cute as can be , <UNK> at everything ."
"smiling when he sees something he likes , and we have even heard a laugh or <#> ."
"of course , <#> shots later , he is <UNK> away ."
<UNK> no guess which way i am voting !
"it is almost like being little again , back in jackson , <UNK> ."
"when you knew what everyone was doing at just about any time of the day , like instant messenger ."
"because even when people are not there , they often leave a message so that i can know what they are up to at any time of the day ."
"michelle is at the beach ( that 's <#> days now , michelle update that thing will ya ? ) ."
it looks like <UNK> is going to the mall .
"my mom is available , so it says , but i know if i send her an i m , i will be waiting forever . and"
"i can tell that my husband , who is only a few feet behind me at his computer , is not currently listening to any music ."
i am letting everyone know that <UNK> turns <#> today !
"i mean , geez , how cool is that ."
the minute natalie signs on i will <UNK> on her and tell her about my dream .
"no more bothering to call people , no letters and less e - mails ."
"some might say that all this is causing a down fall to relationships , i say no sir ."
"first off , in order to talk on the phone with any <#> person , i have to have time ."
"first off , do i have <#> minutes to spend doing nothing else but chit chat ? and"
is that person going to be available at the same time ?
"at that point they write back when they have time , saying just what they want to say and send it along ."
"no more being bothered while eating dinner , while watching a movie , or giving the kids a bath ."
"we can send links back and forth , talk about the kids without them hearing , and just send an "" i love you "" ."
"okay , so you might think we do n't talk anymore , but i can tell you , eric is happy for the quiet once in a while ."
"i am waiting for my mother in law to get i m , we need to get her dsl first ."
"she will be able to keep in touch with everyone , especially the kids ."
"now , we are a mac family , so i can easily voice or video chat ."
i can also send photos over my i m with ease .
"well , <UNK> is trying to figure out where she wants to eat for her birthday dinner ( what is it a special day or something ? )"
she has changed her mind at least <#> times already .
"we will watch the la galaxy on tv and then head to dinner , because frankly nothing comes before the galaxy ."
<#> days ago we put in a bid for ocean view property in <UNK> and still we wait .
"it is where we will spend endless days on the beach , hosting parties , relaxing , and our retirement ."
"great , have i <UNK> it now , does this mean they will say no ?"
of course eric and i kick ourselves for not getting in years ago when we first thought of it and it was much cheaper .
"everyday we hope for an e - mail , a phone call , something ."
"not quite as bad as when we bought our home , but close ."
"well , i am going to go wait some more ."
sometimes i feel as if i am going to go out of my head being at home with <#> kids .
"i count the hours until my husband is home , an adult , someone to help spread the madness ."
how can they be so dang cute and so annoying all at the same time ?
"so , as i think , wow i need to run away , i think a i only have <#> days until i go back to work ."
"i love my job , do n't get me wrong , i love my kids too ."
i try and remember that i probably ( although i do n't see how ) get on their nerves as well .
"if we decide to go to the park , everyone is excited ."
"if we go to the dog beach , woo hoo ."
"but somewhere between the going and the being there , the outing loses some of its appeal and someone is complaining ."
"so , easy enough to fix , hey you do n't like it stay home and do chores ."
"god i 'm bored . only <#> weeks to go till the move , thank god - i am well ready to leave this town ."
read an interesting essay by <UNK> <UNK> entitled ' why lucky jim turned right ' ( from a collection called ' what became of jane <UNK> ? ' ) .
though written in the late <UNK> ( with an <UNK> <UNK> <#> ) it still speaks to me .
the other book i 'm reading there is ' trust ' by francis <UNK> .
"it 's all about the vital role trust plays in building <UNK> , stable societies and how it can be <UNK> ."
"he argues that in italy and france trust tends to <UNK> in the family , and french and italian people are therefore uncomfortable doing business with strangers ."
"for this reason , though there are many small family <UNK> and large state companies there are not enough in between ."
"although this is currently <UNK> , which is worrying ( <UNK> has written about this in bowling alone ) ."
i may take this idea and try to apply it to the eu for my <UNK> .
"to me , this should be a key task of the eu ."
"do we try to raise everybody 's game , or do we just sink to the lowest <UNK> n <UNK> ?"
"do we want the eu to have the ethical standards of sweden , or of <UNK> ?"
"( <UNK> know it 's not a member yet , but it soon will be . )"
"meanwhile , i have been in <UNK> with the head of administration at the place where i am taking my course ."
surely any course that calls itself european studies should have that as the first port of call ?
"though <UNK> by this , i ca n't help wondering why this appears to be a brand - new idea to them ."
"where are all the hundreds of thousands of people leaving notes , <UNK> by my musings ?"
"this blog is a bit <UNK> , since i 'm still in london ."
in fact not moving to <UNK> till the 30th of this month .
"but what the hell , i wish i was there already so no harm in starting early ."
"worried about a math test that i have to take on monday , august 23rd ."
"i know i passed the <#> last semester , but honestly i believe it was all <UNK> !"
"i know <#> gets <#> chances to pass it with an <#> % , but i am still nervous ."
i want to go in and kick butt and be done with it .
then i just plain out scared to death about this upcoming <#> <UNK> .
i am already tired and classes do n't start till the 30th .
"so , a big ole ' hot fudge <UNK> sounds good ."
"okay , so i said i was going to write down my thoughts , but i have decided to just let it go ."
"i am on my way , shortly , to pay the first installment of this years tuition for my children ."
i will be paying damn near as much for <UNK> a month as i do for rent .
and i do n't really care for this school .
"so , that , in itself , makes the experience extremely painful ."
"i shall have to endure the pain for at least <#> more year , then we can check into st ."
"and i really like that , but they did not have a full - time <UNK> ."
answers the question of what i am suppose to do with the kids while in school and at <UNK> .
"luckily , i have the world 's greatest mother in law , if it was n't for i would n't have made it this far ."
"she watches my kids , makes sure they get to school and never <UNK> about it ."
"i think she really , really wants me to <UNK> and i appreciate all that she has done to allow me the opportunity ."
they always seem to have something that you need to buy and forgot to mention at the end of the school year .
", like i need another friggin ' bill this month ."
"but , we will survive , with minimal <UNK> to show for it all ..."
:p may the blue bird of happiness visit you today !
"for the love of god , someone please let me know !"
* <UNK> * i will post later today .
need to get my thoughts in order and i have been <UNK> on a particular subject for a half an hour .
"but , i am positive that it will rear it 's ugly head again and then you all will get an ear full ."
"so , all i have to say <UNK> , the butterfly wrath is coming ... to local <UNK> near you ."
you play the lead in a specialist team of us green <UNK> <UNK> ' ghosts ' because they move <UNK> and without <UNK> .
"you 're in control of a group of <#> soldiers , and are able to switch between them at the touch of a button ."
"the squad management has been handled well , as have the controls ."
"the variety of commands at your <UNK> is limited but my view is that this is a bonus , as it keeps things nice and simple ."
"completely <UNK> , although on xbox live it is promoted to must - have status ."
"even if you 're not nuts about biking , you 'll still enjoy <UNK> <#> ."
"this game offers so much more than the <UNK> , <UNK> world of car <UNK> ."
"it 's simple and stupidly , mind - <UNK> fast ."
"the detail is amazing , sometime it feels like you 're watching a <UNK> race ."
layer after layer of extra details <UNK> to the bikes and the tracks .
bikes are ridiculously well detailed and the colour <UNK> has been used to the full .
"the extra effort in <UNK> has been matched in the <UNK> department , crowd and engine noises are <UNK> ."
the feeling of being slap - bang in the middle of a race is intense .
"but it 's the divine , subtle handling that makes me really love this game ."
there 's also a very deep career mode that will hook you in and never let go .
the addition of <#> - stroke engines means there 's more scope for improvement .
"they are harder to ride , but can offer faster times ."
it 's also possible to race on xbox live and this adds a whole new <UNK> to what is already an accomplished single - player game .
"the feature of xbox design that comes closest to the player , the xbox <UNK> is the most sophisticated <UNK> input device ever created ."
"<UNK> as they ask <UNK> em in the face d : set them on fire , etc the list goes on ) ."
".... do nt let the "" coffee wars "" missions put u off ( i know they re <UNK> )"
"the game addresses a number of the flaws in last year 's version , and it adds online play via xbox live ."
"fans of the sport will appreciate the game 's depth , but it 's not very accessible ."
"whether or not you 're a fan of <UNK> racing , the first <UNK> option you 'll want to take a look at is the master class tutorial section ."
"the car setup options in the game are extensive and , if you 're not <UNK> about such things , they might initially seem a little <UNK> ."
"with that said , those of you who already have knowledge of such things will be at a definite advantage ."
"the game contains <#> tracks , though since they 're all about racing on an <UNK> , there is n't a whole lot of difference between them ."
race length options start at a mere <#> laps and go all the way up to the full distance of <#> laps .
"unlike most racing games , <UNK> series <#> , like the sport it 's based on , is quick to punish you for even the <UNK> of errors ."
"both of these advanced techniques are <UNK> simply by tapping the <UNK> stick , and they are actually a lot easier to use effectively than they sound ."
"generally speaking , the <UNK> comics legend spider - man has always done reasonably well for himself in the world of video games ."
that trend continues with the latest team - up from <UNK> and <UNK> in spider - man <#> .
the main <UNK> that makes spider - man <#> worth playing is the way you swing around the city .
"the game loosely follows the plot of the new film , which <UNK> spider - man against the <UNK> doctor <UNK> ."
"but since only <#> <UNK> does n't seem like enough for a game , spider - man <#> <UNK> in a few others , like the <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"the game is relatively short on story , however ."
even the game 's dull boss encounters seem to come out of nowhere .
"it has a handful of <UNK> to accompany the more important <UNK> , though most of these <UNK> <UNK> are simply used to briefly set up an action sequence ."
most of these in - engine <UNK> look pretty bad because the character models really do n't look so hot up close .
"unfortunately , much of your time playing the game will be spent <UNK> relatively little content spread across an admittedly large environment ."
"the game is broken up into chapters , and it feeds you <UNK> as you proceed ."
"each chapter also has an <UNK> goal that <UNK> you a set number of "" hero points . """
"and while there are a number of different ways to earn the extra hero points you 'll need , none of them are particularly interesting ."
the game forces you to take on a lot of extra <UNK> just to earn enough hero points to proceed .
"or , sometimes it 's an <UNK> , and you 'll just have to fight your way out of it ."
"thankfully , these core story missions are more interesting ."
"by and large , most of these challenges are n't especially difficult , so you 'll likely get through each <#> on your first or second attempt ."
"admit it , no game on xbox live has ever been as fun and <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> , this however could be set to change ."
i have managed to get myself a copy of pro race driver <#> and i can honestly say it is pure class .
"the graphics are smooth , and easily as good as project <UNK> <#> ( if not better ! ) ."
it was paul from my local gaming <UNK> .
.. and that the copy was mine if i wanted to come and get it .....
ten minutes later a very large and orange <UNK> <UNK> bike <UNK> into life and headed for the local <UNK> of all that is wonderful and <UNK> <UNK> .
i popped open the wallet and <UNK> them the required amount and they went into the back to get the box for me.. .... ....
the guys kindly lent me a telephone cable from the shop to strap this <UNK> to the rack on my bike .
ok now for the stuff that you are reading this review for .
the box was opened and inside was some very surprising things .
so in time <UNK> tradition i <UNK> the <UNK> over my shoulder and <UNK> straight into the game .
", you are sat in the <UNK> with another enemy <UNK> right outside the <UNK> door <UNK> the life out of it and trying to get at you first ."
you press a button to close the <UNK> and then thumb the <UNK> button to start the system up once you are <UNK> in the <UNK> .
it is at this very moment that i am <UNK> senseless and on the top right hand side a very large red button flashes with some <UNK> .
this is where the foot <UNK> comes in handy .
if you are walking <UNK> and press it then your <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> at extreme <UNK> and the same if the <UNK> is in reverse gear .
"use this <UNK> wisely , for once it has <UNK> pressed it has to <UNK> itself from the generator core which can take a few seconds ."
"so , now we think we can dance rings around the enemy in this baby and <UNK> him senseless into the next life - hang on a moment !"
"<UNK> is a warning called "" <UNK> "" what does this mean ! ,"
the <UNK> button flashes and this time i manage to <UNK> out and save my life .
ok this dude is going down if it ’s the last thing i do .
"you know the rest , stamp stamp stamp , lock on , machine guns <UNK> - <UNK> do their thing and before you know it ...."
"there are <#> <UNK> online which consist of campaign and free mode , and it ’s free mode that is probably the best to start with ."
this is where you will meet like minded <UNK> players and the not - so like minded ones .
"this is where you will find people willing to be a buddy with you , for the plain fact that you are from their country and have this game ."
online is the bit you will learn the most from this game and you will start to <UNK> what the <UNK> don’t and won’t tell you .
<UNK> has provided the bare basics of background and information which i think is a good thing as it helps you <UNK> deeper into the steel <UNK> world .
"i will see you on the battlefield , where no doubt i will be <UNK> johnny <UNK> into a fight ."

"<UNK> has always placed a higher emphasis on artificial intelligence , and halo <#> is looking to be no different ."
of your marine allies has been <UNK> up as well .
"soldiers <UNK> assault <UNK> and <UNK> will advance to the front lines , covering each other ’s backs and warning <#> another of any potential <UNK> ."
"<UNK> will typically seek out a good <UNK> point up on a hill somewhere , then proceed to let loose on their <UNK> targets from a safe distance ."
marines even have the ability to flip over objects and use them for cover as they see fit .
", it ’s safe to say that we’ll be seeing a lot more of them in halo <#> ."
"a large part of what made halo ’s combat such an intense , strategic experience was the weapon selection ."
"that ’s why the introduction of new weapons must be done carefully , with regards to <UNK> the delicate balance found in the original ."
"we now know of <#> new weapons so far that have made the cut for halo <#> , <#> of which was <UNK> in the aforementioned trailer ."
"the weapon from the trailer is a combination of the <UNK> rifle and assault rifle , which has come to be known as the battle rifle ."
"of course , there are many more that have yet to be revealed , but the old standards are sure to be there as well ."
"to go along with his new look , the chief will also have a handful of new tools at his <UNK> ."
"and if that were not enough for you , then perhaps you’d prefer the idea of combo <UNK> attacks ."
"if you time your button <UNK> properly , you’ll be able to string together up to <#> <UNK> attacks into <#> skull - <UNK> combo ."
"lastly , the master chief will have the ability to pull down his weapon and break into a full <UNK> ."
"according to <UNK> , halo <#> will more than double the amount of vehicles from the original ."
"there ’s also an <UNK> , which basically looks like a <UNK> - down <UNK> ."
"the vehicle has no weapons , but can carry a single passenger faster than any other vehicle ."
"halo <#> also has <#> different models of the <UNK> , each suited for different <UNK> ."
"again , this is only a small taste of what ’s to come ."
the level design in halo has long been a topic of debate .
"many areas were <UNK> similar in design , and some even <UNK> on <UNK> painted onto the ground to keep players from getting lost ."
– <UNK> had to work under a very tight development schedule to get the game out in time for the xbox ’s launch .
"but with halo <#> , which <UNK> already been working on for nearly a year , the team has a lot more time to work on the level design ."
"it will be an entirely different experience , and the new setting will likely hit some of us a lot closer to home ."
"we all know the levels in halo <#> are going to look a whole lot better , but <UNK> isn’t content to stop there with the <UNK> ."
certain <UNK> will also allow you to shoot out lights and hide in the shadows to take out the <UNK> .
enemies may even come equipped with <UNK> for low - light situations such as these .
but keep in mind that the <UNK> have no intention of turning the game into a <UNK> - based affair .
"this is still the same old halo , only in a delightful , <UNK> <UNK> form ."
the <UNK> aspect of halo <#> will be <UNK> to support <UNK> games over xbox live .
"there will be plenty of original maps , with a stronger focus on outdoor , vehicle - based levels like the ever - popular blood <UNK> map from halo ."
"<UNK> , the game will not include <UNK> <UNK> , as <UNK> would rather have people playing online or via split - screen ."
"the developers <UNK> large - scale , squad - based online games , something that will be made possible only through <UNK> ."
"as i’ve already <UNK> at , halo <#> is not simply an add - on to halo , nor is it halo <#> ."
we all have to wait until the release though to see <UNK> it turns out .
it ’s pretty obvious what a success <UNK> ’s console <UNK> of the rainbow <#> <#> series has been on the xbox .
you don’t stay at the top of the sales charts and manage to be the most played xbox live title for nothing .
"while the single player campaign of rainbow <#> <#> ( <UNK> ) was solid , its real pay off was in the <UNK> ."
the team based <UNK> was nearly perfect aside from a few early <UNK> and <#> cal happy <UNK> that didn’t care to get into the heart of the battle .
"a max of <#> on <#> players , fantastic level design , and <UNK> content ; how could you not love this game ?"
we’ve had some quality time with <UNK> ’s killer <UNK> and bring you our initial thoughts .
"first off , rest assured that black arrow is a <UNK> game and not a simple expansion pack with only a few new levels ."
<UNK> <UNK> will immediately feel right at home being that the game interface is almost identical to the previous game aside from the new features .
"the game is live aware , so you’ll automatically be logged into live if you have an active account ."
"it ’s also good to know that the controls are exactly same as the last game , so no surprises there ."
"that ’s right , no more <#> cal my little <UNK> friends ."
single player i know more people that own rainbow <#> <#> and have never played its single - player game <UNK> than any other xbox title out there .
black arrow ’s campaign mode contains <#> new levels that are a good mix of indoor and outdoor settings .
"stats are now kept not only for <UNK> <UNK> , but the single player <UNK> as well ."
"lone rush is a single - player game only , so no <UNK> here for assistance ."
"luckily bonus time is awarded for every terrorist killed , <UNK> saved , or bomb <UNK> ."
there are plenty of bad guys spread throughout the level that put up a stiff challenge even for the most <UNK> <UNK> player .
any method that gives you an edge on the <UNK> and outs of a map will prove to be extremely valuable online
this is a review and pre - view database of all things xbox
i had <UNK> show up this morning to give me am estimate on painting the upstairs rooms .... they decided they could start immediately .
they will be mostly done tomorrow ... which is cool ... but
now i have so much to do and am still <UNK> ...
have my bed that is still not here.. still have no <UNK> for it
... still <UNK> to get the carpet in ...
i know its a never ending battle but a <UNK> would be nice .
i do not think the kitchen has been that clean since before my back was hurt .
he kept checking on me making sure i was not needing anything as he worked .
he fixed a meal i could eat ... and enjoy .
served it to me and kept the girls entertained while i ate .
i am thinking it maybe time for a small <UNK> for reward for his <UNK> hard work .
maybe something can be worked for next week .
would like to have <#> room <UNK> ... so no sooner than the end of next week .
already thinking about what we can do for the play .
heh what the hell i am doing up at this hour i will never know .
my jaw still hurts from the dentist . and my neck and back are giving me arguments also .
i am excited that my sub will be here today .
i think he is going to clean the kitchen too * sigh * poor thing its a mess and a half .
perhaps i am giving away some of my secrets lol or causing <UNK> too many ideas lol but here are some of the links i regularly use .
.... urllink <UNK> search not <#> i have used a ton .
urllink resources urllink passion magazine urllink <UNK> page urllink rob and <UNK> teasing and denial page urllink the crystal bridge - exploring alternative <UNK> urllink anna 's art
i was talking to another <UNK> friend of mine the last few days .
she thinks i am a bit <UNK> since i am not into the intense <UNK> and humiliation she is =p .
lol guess that is <#> reason i did not get along so well with many i have met since i am <UNK> of others .
she is a very very sweet lady ... who uses her <UNK> like paper ...
literally ... she has never shown any concern for them at all .
she will only play with those who show great tolerance for pain and <UNK> .
"the others she allows to clean her house , do her shopping , run errands , etc ... with never even a word of praise or thanks ."
and she is the <#> with <UNK> <UNK> lined up at any <#> time ...
i used to wonder what i was doing wrong .
was i too nice to be a <UNK> .
should i learn to <UNK> and do the intense <UNK> .
in a scene i can do the <UNK> ( some ) and i do enjoy light <UNK> .
but i decided much the same thing in my vanilla relationships as i did in these ...
i have always believed that everything we have endured in our life makes us the person we are today .
if we do not like that person then we can change ourselves .
others will like us or not ... but what is important is that we like us .
i have been asked why i did not have more <UNK> .
# <#> i can not devote my time and energy to more than <#> at a time .
and to me it would be doing a <UNK> to the sub ( who is a person ) to do any less than <UNK> myself to the relationship .
# <#> the <UNK> in the area have not been interested in service really .
they are only <UNK> in what i can do for them .
and the ones i talked to were into the <UNK> stuff than i am . and
# <#> they wanted to play the very first time we met .
i have to meet someone and get to know them before i can even consider to play with them .
since i have had a fun day thanks to the local dentist this may be a bit <UNK> .
i confess i am in a bit of a shock . to have found a sub who loves to <UNK> and care for you
i <UNK> i was disappointed that he was unable to do the things he thought he would sunday .
but he did seem to take things in <UNK> and adapt well to a day of relaxation for me .
friday was <#> of the most relaxing fun days i have had in a long time .
although i think he felt he was a star in a comedy of errors .
after my last blog he asked if we could talk on the phone .
i found that talking to him was very easy .
he managed to follow my jumps in topic and <UNK> .
* i do not know which was more amusing .
the fact that nothing seemed to go exactly right for him or his reactions .
i literally laughed more than i have in a long time .
"he was <UNK> , <UNK> , lol and amusing ."
he arrived a bit early lol and proceeded to win the girls over .
first i forgot the <UNK> that had the <UNK> for the <UNK> we were checking on .
then we get to home depot to see what was available and find that the truck has a flat .
so we head back to the house to drop that truck off .
"when we return to the house , he offers to drive ."
first we go the wrong direction lol but i have never seen a vehicle that could not turn around .
lol there were a lot of little things that seemed set on frustrating him.. lol and <UNK> me .
even the stops we made ... things always went a bit off .
a store that almost always carries what i went for was out ...
i have to admit i was still a bit <UNK> .
probably because we are still in this getting to know you stage and its awkward and <UNK> .
well this has definately been a most interesting few days .
i had pretty much taken myself out of the scene <UNK> .
the <UNK> were giving the impression like the entire scene was a competition .
"who could play with the most "" boys "" or who could make the most "" boys "" safe out ."
"most of the <UNK> treated the "" boys "" as if they were <UNK> and <UNK> ."
whether these <#> attitudes fed on each other or not ... it was not something i could deal with on a constant basis .
with my husband out of the country and all the added <UNK> ...
i left my personal information on <#> sites and stayed on the discussion group but i stopped attending <UNK> and <UNK> .
i like being able to get to know someone .
"over the last year of low activity from me , i have gotten maybe <#> contacts via these sites ."
none <UNK> out when they learned i had not done cyber <UNK> and did not want a cyber slave .
so when another email came in from someone with dom in their name ...
"imagine my surprise when within <#> emails i found an intelligent , funny man who already had made me laugh ."
he was appropriate in his <UNK> without being <UNK> .
i doubt i have laughed that much in my life .
even for being a smart ass he is hilarious .
we can talk as friends and that is a huge bonus to me .
we managed to meet ... and i was impressed .
i was almost <UNK> i would have to go into big bad <UNK> mode for the entire time but
instead i was able to relax and be myself .
something i prefer greatly anyway since i already wear enough masks .
well for some reason the word <UNK> pops into my head .
it is hard to describe what was going through my head at the end when we decided we would like to try to get together .
i was <UNK> that i made such an impression i suppose . then despite myself the worries set in .
i have been through a lot in life and most of it was caused by males umm well basically lying to me .
i <UNK> made the decision to give it a few days and see if the attitude changed .
"i suppose i have been expecting it to , and it has not ."
he is still as interesting and fun and i have to stop making things so hard .
today on the drive home i ran over many things in my head .
i got hit with a major case of the <UNK> .
heh even doing the dishes has been too much trouble for me the last <#> days .
"so the bedroom is still not finished , the dishes are not done , and the house is still not cleaned ."
now i just have to find the music to go with them and program them into the website ...
mom had asked me to come down to her house and spend the night saturday night .
her church was having a gathering sunday morning and a singing
drew and cat had both said the previous week that they would come and watch the dogs saturday night .
to me this sounded like he was still coming .
i left saturday about 1:30 headed to mom 's .
sitting on the dock and watching the water <UNK> .
<UNK> fried fresh fish for all and we had a good dinner .
mom had even gotten me a birthday cake for sunday and <#> of my sisters had her family were coming too .
about <#> pm i called home to check on things .
( note ... only reason i worry about my dogs is my closest neighbor hates dogs and shot <#> recently ) there was no answer .
i called cat to make sure she was still planning on heading to my house and got no answer .
she informed me that she had been drinking and had forgotten she was supposed to be there .
so i start trying to track down drew and find out if he was on the way or what .
these poor puppies had not been able to go outside for <#> hours at this time .
after trying to reach someone for <#> hours i gave up and started home .
* sigh * so <#> hours sleep friday night ... <#> miles and <#> hours of driving .
my mom and i do not have the greatest relationship anymore and the fact the visit was going so well was wonderful for me ...
then to have to cut it short because my friends could not keep their word ...
finally managed to crash around <#> ... and i get a call at <#> am .
a sub i have been watching out for had another crisis .
he is trying to live on his own in a new town and feeling very vulnerable and alone .
so he calls and talks and talks and talks .
"* sigh * so i am <UNK> , dating counselor , lol damn and support group for him at this time ."
i have never met a person who had almost no <UNK> in <UNK> at all ... not in any of their abilities or anything .
he is totally self <UNK> and will not even try to see the abilities he has .
so after talking to him for a while sunday morning i was wired and bored =p .
so i start surfing and went shopping some to umm raise my spirits =p .
"finally broke down and bought the <UNK> set i have been looking at , a new <UNK> , and a few other neat <UNK> ."
matt called and we got to talk for quite a while .
he is definately ready to get a break from the sand and heat of <UNK> .
we talked over some of the plans we have for his leave when he returns .
i am trying to work out a surprise for him to go to a <UNK> <UNK> concert in november .
but he loves <UNK> so it would be cool .
ok this is longer and more rambling than i had intended ...
lol what a <UNK> time of the morning .
but mom has asked that i come down to spend the night with them .
i do not like being separated from my dogs .
and mom will not allow dogs inside =p so they will stay here .
i have always believed that the choices and experiences we have throughout our life make us the person we are today .
"i may have been through hell a few times , but it gave me unique and different <UNK> on life ."
someone today asked me why i became a <UNK> .
i do not believe that is a simple answer .
then again i do not choose to label myself a <UNK> all the time .
i like being able to have heated discussions with people ...
i like being able to disagree with them ... and not have them just roll over and give up .
i run into so many <UNK> about <UNK> in general .
"and i know up to a few years ago if a woman said she was a <UNK> she was seen as an <UNK> , or a freak ."
the location i live in today is still that way ( <UNK> certain circles ) .
strong women of any type are looked down on and <UNK> .
i have been <UNK> with the name <UNK> for years simply because i would not back down to the men in my life and work .
i have seen some <UNK> who went out of their way to be overly cruel because that is what they thought they had to do .
i thought <UNK> my <UNK> side would free me in a way .
allow me to explore the side of me that always seemed present .
but my question is ... am i ? in reality being <UNK> has done little but cause me problems in many ways .
my first marriage was ruined because of many things .
<#> of which was i was not enough of a <UNK> for him ( started as a vanilla marriage ) .
it wars with the ideals i was brought up with .
"a woman is to be <UNK> , <UNK> and mild ."
<UNK> to her mate at least in public and letting him have the lead .
a woman 's place is the home and her job is to care for her family .
"if she works , she is to put aside the things she wants to do to still care for home and family ."
although i have never had a sub clean etc for me ... its not something that would cross my mind
". if he volunteered or did it without being told , i would accept it ."
but i am still <UNK> with those <UNK> ideas .
"and now i am constantly <UNK> by <UNK> who ... at least give the impression ... want to be used , but never perform service or really be dominated ..."
most i have been <UNK> by seem to want to top from the bottom ...
they do not give the impression of being willing to release that control .
i have seen many <UNK> who seemed to want to play with as many <UNK> as they could .
for me at least there has to be some connection ... and i have to be able to talk to them ... as a real person .
i am not <#> for <UNK> in my <UNK> handle .
i have never done much online ... except looking at reference sites .
i just can not get into the <UNK> and playing online ... even in vanilla <UNK> its not something i have been able to get into .
i am much more a <UNK> person and its something i have not really <UNK> .
<UNK> i had <#> dom tell me i could not be a <UNK> cause
lol god that started a discussion that he came out loser in =p but maybe wiser .
i love to learn new things ... and very few things would i say out and out no to .
"i am usually willing to try something , provided i can do it safely for my partner ."
lol ok time to go lose my mind in more games .
i have fought and fought over starting a blog .
but i have started to realise that this may be the best format for me at this time .
today is <#> days before my <UNK> birthday .
"although i am a bit of a <UNK> and love my alone time , i am starting to get tired of spending all important days alone ."
"well ok not alone , i do have my dogs ."
but they are hard to have good conversations with =p .
with the most important person in my life thousands of miles away again things around here get rough at times .
"i am a very self sufficient person , used to being seen as powerful and strong , but not feeling that way at this time ."
i am hoping this will not become a lesson in frustration lol so am ending it for now since that is all i feel at this time .
the question in my profile requested me to write lyrics to a new national anthem using an animal sound more than once .
"well , there was barely any room to write a thought ."
"<UNK> , use your imagination to figure out who in your life this may apply to ."
"lyrics : ( okay , probably wo n't fit to music , but it is deep ) what happened to our glory ?"
"we were settled by people looking for freedom of belief , why are we settling for narrow - minded , <UNK> , <UNK> , war <UNK> leadership ?"
over the past few years i 've had a growing <UNK> of being an american .
"i feel i should become more politically <UNK> , but when i try i am so overwhelmed by all the double - speak ."
"after <#> , with all the blind patriotism , turning into <UNK> , it 's gotten worse ."
i wish i knew what i could do .
"i 've tried to make a difference , working in nursing homes for <#> years ( horror stories ) , <UNK> ( ca n't stand the <UNK> ) ."
now that i 've done it i 'm not sure what to say .
i just got turned on to this phenomenon yesterday while searching for a laptop sleeve for my new <UNK> tiny sony <UNK> .
"anyway , got sent to a girl 's post about her search for a similar bag ."
"i know that my daughter and her friends are into on - line <UNK> , but this was cooler ."
"i read <#> girl 's blog today , who does most of her entries as <UNK> - like poems ."
this is the link to a band cd that my daughter gave me that really <UNK> me .
i was listening to a <UNK> <UNK> the other day - i mean
", those guys were totally hilarious when i was a kid , and frankly , i still find their show rather amusing when i happen across it ."
"me , i always associated myself with mike - which <UNK> me in later years when it was <UNK> that mike was the only musician in the group ."
"<UNK> was too much of a <UNK> , peter too much a waste - case , and mickey was too scattered ."
"granted , they did it very well and the tunes were actually hits - who has n't heard "" <UNK> believer , """
"granted , this is what music is all about today in the pop , rock , and alternative world ."
cookie - <UNK> bands that all sound alike shoot for that top spot on the sales charts .
"frankly , i do n't really find this all that horrible - its a business model that works for them and the public seems to like it ..."
"<UNK> fed something they enjoy , so no big deal ."
"when you talked about "" a new sound , "" you really were talking about something nobody had done or heard before ."
it had to be an <UNK> wonderful time for music and musicians as walls were torn down and <UNK> were created .
"that 's something new "" was when rap first made a <UNK> on the collective consciousness in the early <#> 's ."
"since then , nothing new has really come about ."
"but now , anything new ( if there is such a thing ) is considered too much of a risk to spend money on by the record companies ."
where is the next musical revolution going to come from ?
"where are the beach boys , roger <UNK> 's , and beatles of our day ?"
"i think someone must be grabbing them , taking them out back , and shooting them , if they exist at all ."
"actually , i have a problem with sex being considered <UNK> in the first place ."
"sorry , but i tend to shy away from sex if it is filthy or dirty ."
"a nice <UNK> bath is a great way to start things off , for instance ."
"i guess really bad sex could be considered foul ... or sex with say , oh , bill clinton ?"
i promise not to get political for the rest of this entry ... )
<#> ) <UNK> <UNK> ; <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> .
"if sex is depressing , then there are problems with the relationship ."
<#> ) morally <UNK> : “ the <UNK> details of his <UNK> <UNK> under his very <UNK> ” ( james joyce ) .
wow ... a quote from joyce to support a definition .
"knowing joyce , there 's no telling what he meant by the term <UNK> !"
"just spend a few hours with <UNK> 's wake to understand what i 'm talking about ... morally <UNK> , eh ?"
the problem here is that i do n't tend to accept the typical moral structures of society .
"morals are quite personal , though most people tend to define their personal morals via a higher authority ( religion , typically ) ."
"mind you , there is morally wrong sex ( sex with a child , for instance ) -"
"but i have no interest in talking about that , unless i get pissed - off enough about some situation where it is <UNK> ..."
<#> ) <UNK> <UNK> ; <UNK> oooh ... that 's a good <#> !
"frankly , any sex that can be described like this must be describing as sex done by a sex <UNK> ( a <UNK> ) ."
i was amongst a group of slightly drunken <UNK> the other night and they decided that we all should go to a strip club .
but i was really annoyed by what i saw there - the art of <UNK> is <UNK> !
these women looked like they were sleep - walking through everything in a <UNK> mechanical manner .
i 'm amazed anyone was turned on ... maybe i needed to me more drunk ...
"mind you , the person who posted the request for <UNK> sex info has a moral structure that is based on more mainstream codes than mine ."
so sex may very well be <UNK> at times for them .
"in all honesty , i 'll bet that makes it more exciting in a way ..."
"so for the balance of my <UNK> 's school years , the wife and i have home - <UNK> my <#> daughters ."
"however , as they made more and more friends with regular - school children , my yard - <UNK> decided that they wanted to go to public school ."
we were n't going to keep them from it if they thought it was where they wanted to go ...
"so yesterday , they headed to their new <UNK> to begin a more typical stage to their childhood in the 4th and 5th grades ."
"honestly , i think the schools will do a fine job of teaching them what they need to know ."
that 's not all that big a deal to me .
i 'm frightened that my kids will end up as just another couple of <UNK> .
my first example of this was provided when they returned from school yesterday afternoon .
my children have never been fans of jeans - you 'd have to make a deal with them to wear anything but shorts or something fancy .
"but after a day at school , they were <UNK> for a new wardrobe of jeans and t - shirts since everyone else wore jeans and t - shirts ."
"my kids have never wanted tennis shoes - <UNK> sandals ( flip flops , usually ) or even better - no shoes . but tennis shoes ? """
"it 's what everyone 's wearing , "" explained my <UNK> ... who <UNK> the most wonderful <UNK> of any <#> year old i know ."
"maybe they 'll just do what is necessary to fit in , but not lose the magic beings they 've come to be ."
but i 'm in mourning for my daughter 's rapidly <UNK> <UNK> .
"its a better title than blog entry , i 'm afraid ."
i 've been <UNK> sick the last week and it just got worse over the last few days .
the last thing i 've been interested in doing was <UNK> out words into the <UNK> - that would require putting hands to keys which was just too <UNK> .
perhaps i 'll write something on this <UNK> title as sex seems to pull people in from all sides .
they always tend to bring the <UNK> out of the <UNK> .
elections are a great engine for <UNK> the country .
i am also regularly amused by the local press .
"its <UNK> , though often short - <UNK> ."
"so , here we have an extreme left wing letter ..."
then a little further down the page is an extremely conservative letter about the evils of the library ( discussed in urllink my first blog entry ) .
"i mean , having to tow the state line all the time just is n't much fun ."
"its getting further away from us all the time , now , but some of us still remember pictures of eastern <UNK> countries and the people there ..."
he laid out the situation with the presidential election ...
it was possible that the person with the least votes could actually win ... the electoral college <UNK> with the final result anyway ...
"i mean , really - the old style voting <UNK> where you poke the paper is a gas ."
its such a satisfying sound when the paper gives way .
"i 've not tried <#> of the electronic ones , but that 's got to be at least as fun as <UNK> - off with my <UNK> ."
have a few drinks with friends and go as a group ...
"during the meeting , <#> of the members was called out of the room for a moment ."
he was just another k of c member who agreed to go along with the little <UNK> - to prove a point .
these peace - loving christians were ready to kill someone because they were acting as a group ...
he was <UNK> wanting me to beware of such things .
"according to my grandfather , they were sworn to <UNK> that the event had occurred ."
"but when he told me about it , he noted that the message was too important to hide , and was many years gone anyway ."
there 's a movement here in <UNK> county by some concerned citizens to address how books are being <UNK> in our public <UNK> .
"personally , i think every <UNK> should read positive stories about gay ducks to help us all live together in harmony ... but"
i know that 's not how the rest of the world thinks .
<#> of these right - <UNK> wrote a letter to the local paper and even quoted george washington ( um ...
<UNK> he die more than <#> years ago ? )
"so we must be against ' em ! "" ) ."
"i just wrote a poem called "" falling apart again "" and put it to music ."
"it took me about <#> minutes to write the poem , and about <#> minutes to write the vocals and music ."
i remember when i was in the hospital after <#> of my <UNK> .
i had an internal infection and they did n't know if i was going to live .
"i wanted to see the sky , so the nurse <UNK> my bed to the hall where there was a big window ."
my wife was too fucked up on <UNK> and <UNK> to come see me .
i was in the hospital for over a month and she only brought my daughter <UNK> to visit me twice .
"the hall was glowing from the sunshine , and i thought maybe this is the angel 's hall and they were coming to take me ."
"i remember being <UNK> to the window , and thinking if a <UNK> comes to me , my time is up ."
i <UNK> the back <UNK> at core creek park to play my guitar and sing .
"i saw several <UNK> , and it reminded me of when i almost died in the hospital , looking for <UNK> in the angel 's hall ."
it 's a beautiful day with <UNK> clouds <UNK> up in the sky .
the butterfly visited me and the <UNK> flew away .
"i can sense that my love is out there somewhere , and her spirit has found me ."
"it 's coming together now , but it still falls apart ."
"they say if a <UNK> visits you , it 's a sign of death ."
"i 'm up , i 'm down , i 'm up , i 'm down ."
and it 's falling apart again ... falling apart again
( notes & poem from <UNK> ) it 's so beautiful here in the old growth forest .
these trees are <#> - <#> feet tall and <#> feet in <UNK> .
i 'm surprised i did n't come here sooner .
i wish i could 've shown this to my daughter <UNK> .
maybe someday ... it 's been raining a lot this summer .
"i just wrote a poem called "" <UNK> trail "" ."
when i fall in love i 'll write happy poems .
"what i write now are deep , emotional , <UNK> soul - searching poems ."
"i 'm here where i want to be , and i love it here in the mountains ."
"i do n't like being around crowds , and i love to hike <UNK> where no <#> 's around ."
it reminds me of the emptiness in my heart .
"i sit here where i 'm happiest , but i 'm so sad and lonely ."
"i come to these places and take in the beauty , longing for someone to share it with ."
"when this lonely feeling hits me , i do n't feel like being around people ."
i want to love someone and someone love me so bad .
someone who would love to hike in this old growth forest .
"that was me long ago , with <UNK> , <#> years old , asking her daddy questions like "" daddy , are there any bears here ? """
""" daddy , can you put me on your shoulders ? """
"this pain , this loss , is driving me ."
"the sun will shine again , shine down on me , and i will be happy again ."
"she 'll be smiling for me then , on <UNK> trail ..."
i have to hike down the mountain and then drive <#> <#> hours .
i do n't want to be driving on the <UNK> late at night .
the last time i did it changed my life forever ...
"urllink my pack ; <UNK> , blue , and thunder ."
i love her so much and i love my baby boys .
i wrote a poem that i 'm going to put to music and make a song .
my new pack wanted me to take them to <UNK> and be their tour guide since i 've had previous experience with ghosts there .
"i learned how to sing and play "" when johnny comes marching home "" ."
i wanted to <UNK> to the haunted spirits that <UNK> the fields and woods of <UNK> .
i am just trying to live to its fullest and <UNK> at the moon .
"well , we got to devil 's den at <UNK> pm ."
my camera is at my ex wife 's and i 'll probably never see it again .
we walked to the <UNK> field and i started singing lightly ( without guitar ) .
"at the top left corner of the <UNK> field , i started feeling a cold spot , then it got hot ."
my chest felt like it was getting squeezed and electricity was running through my veins .
we walked into the field and the feeling left .
we ran into a couple from illinois taking pics .
"the lady told us last time she was there , something pushed her from behind real hard , though no <#> was there ."
we left the <UNK> field and headed back to devil 's den .
it was 10:00 and the park closes at <#> .
"we went back to the truck , and i pulled out my guitar and sat on the wall facing the <UNK> pen in front of <UNK> run ."
"i started playing and singing "" when johnny comes marching home "" ."
"i learned to play it nice and slow , giving it a creepy , eerie , haunted sound . about halfway through the song"
", i heard a woman singing with me in front of me ."
"at first , i thought it was our pack female , but she does n't sing ."
then i heard more voices singing both in front of me and behind me .
"when i finished , i said to <UNK> , "" were you singing ?"
"she said no , but she heard a whole bunch of people singing and it was n't coming from our pack !"
i played it again and i had a haunted chorus join me .
my whole body felt like it had electricity running thru it and was surrounded by some kind of energy field .
<UNK> was trying to figure out if the voices we heard were just some kind of echo playing tricks on us .
"but the singing was on time with me , with no delay , and i could <UNK> between a female voice and several other deep male voices ."
"i had to stop because i was shaking so bad , and was also worried about the park cop showing up and giving us a ticket ."
my body felt like it was being <UNK> and running with electricity .
i thanked whoever was out there for singing with me .
i said maybe some people were on top of devil 's den and their car is parked behind it .
we drove around devil 's den and there were no cars anywhere .
"this was wednesday , and i still have that feeling <#> days later like i am surrounded by an energy field and something is <UNK> my chest ."
a former pack member of mine lives down in florida .
urllink <UNK> i sent him <#> of my poems and he put music to it .
"well , here 's the email that i sent him describing how i came up with another poem , and the poem itself ."
"i ca n't get rid of this weird feeling , like i 'm <UNK> or something ."
this all started when i was singing and playing at devil 's den and i ca n't get rid of this feeling .
"speaking of creepy , i came up with this poem , mixing the experience of that night , along with some civil war stuff and you coming home ."
emily was a real rebel female soldier during the civil war .
"she asked for someone to deliver a message to her dad to "" forgive your dying daughter "" just before she died ."
rock creek is a creek at <UNK> where they setup a field hospital in the woods at rock creek where many soldiers died .
"devil 's den is the haunted place at <UNK> where i sang with the ghosts "" when <UNK> comes marching home "" ."
i do n't know how men can be such jerks .
i guess being raised by women and not growing up with a father has something to do with it . especially after being lied to about his existence .
"for some reason <UNK> to me , i was afraid to ask my mom about my dad , and she never talked about him ."
i asked my aunts and cousins who he was .
<#> aunt told me he was a no - good drunk and i did n't want to know him .
"i always wondered why i did n't have a dad , and was ashamed to tell anyone ."
back in the <#> 's it was <UNK> to not have a dad .
( my mom stopped taking me to church at an early age for some reason ... )
it was <UNK> to see other kids with their dads .
"i remember when i was <#> years old , and my mom and i moved to another relatives house ."
i ended up making a friend with a kid named <UNK> .
<#> night he started <UNK> about where his dad worked and telling me about how strong his dad was .
i told him i did n't have a dad .
"his jaw dropped , his eyes nearly popped out of his head , and he said to me , "" that means you 're a bastard !"
"he said he had to go , and never talked to me again ."
( i believe his family was <UNK> catholic . )
the reality of the situation really started to hit me that night .
not having a dad was a lot more serious than i thought .
"i do n't know why he called me a son of a bitch , and i later found out what a bastard was ."
i never again told any kids i did n't have a father .
i lied several times to other kids about my dad after that episode .
i found out i was half italian when i was <#> .
i managed to lie through school saying i was <#> % irish .
when i was <#> my uncle asked me if my mom ever told me who my dad was .
( my uncle will be another post ; a big post ) i told him no .
he must 've said something to my mom and she called me and asked me to meet her .
"apparently , his wife and daughters did n't know about me ."
"after i found out , i got really drunk with my friends and went to his house ."
i knocked on the screen door and his wife was sitting on the chair in the living room .
"she looked up at me and said "" what do you want ! """
"i told her i 'm ( my mom ) 's son , and i 'm here to see joe ( my father ) ."
"my father came around the bar , <UNK> a drink , looking at the door ."
he came up to the screen door and we just looked into each other 's eyes for what seemed like an eternity .
"he finally said , "" can you come back another time ?"
i just wanted to stop by and say hello .
"well , i guess i let the cat out of the bag ."
you know he still never tried to contact me .
i guess someone will tell me when he dies .
i never got the balls to contact my sisters .
"i do n't know them , and i do n't know if they know about me ."
"if so , do they hold me responsible for their parents divorce ?"
i do n't remember the <#> girls from school .
<#> are older than me and <#> are younger than me .
"gosh , it 's been so fun the past few days shopping for new school clothes and buying books ."
i went out to dinner last night with my honey .
i wore my black lace top with my <UNK> than <UNK> squeeze jeans and heels .
"the place we went to was <UNK> , in fact , everything was <UNK> - <UNK> ."
"of course , it is just the calm before the storm because classes begin on monday ."
"i wish someone else could just sit in for me , take my tests and do all my homework ."
so i am working out in the gym on campus today .
"<#> totally old , totally not rich - to - make - up for - their - <UNK> , men want to get their game on with me ."
"liver spots are okay if you <UNK> them with a fat , fat wallet ."
"like i am going to hook up with some prof on a <#> to <#> dollar a year job , in kentucky no less ."
"in my opinion , the best these old boys can hope for is a blow for a good grade ... <UNK> !"
so i am getting started on my reviews of the <UNK> .
"ah yes , the good ole u.s . of a. , where <#> can be an ass of a human being and still <UNK> out a living ."
see why i am so frustrated with the <UNK> of my royal life ?
so do you think you may have been switched at birth ?
"think you may be a princess , but somehow were denied your <UNK> ?"
"well , you do n't have to be a urllink little girl to have your <UNK> ."
this urllink kinda stuff happens a lot .
"urllink <UNK> ginger is probably <UNK> as well , although her accent is a bit rough ."
"let me tell you , it is n't easy having royal blood flow through you veins while you are living on a used shoe string ."
instead it comes across as over - produced <UNK> pop with an <UNK> title and bad cover art to boot .
""" new moon on monday "" is okay , but then the tracks <UNK> into <UNK> pop <UNK> . """
"cracks in the pavement "" and "" i take the dice "" are pure <UNK> <UNK> ."
"union of the snake "" is solid chart material , the strongest song with a solid <UNK> bass beat , excellent <UNK> and some good horn work . """
"the album ends <UNK> , far short of it 's intended goal ."
"this album needs a serious "" director 's cut "" style updating from nick and simon to bring it back to <UNK> ."
buy this version only if you have to have it to complete your collection .
i 'd give it a solid <#> stars .
"matt <UNK> continues to impress in his most "" <UNK> "" role to date as jason bourne ; half lost soul , half trained killer ."
<UNK> does an excellent job of <UNK> the <UNK> of his character and the <UNK> it places on bourne 's psyche .
well worth the full ride fare to see it in theaters .
ohio swings hard to bush ; last <#> polls he has <UNK> lead : urllink <UNK>

urllink <UNK> kerry has even dropped <#> % in maine ...
"bush is gaining in the polls and kerry is slipping steadily , day - by - day ."
we will have a <#> player game at my house this friday night @ <UNK> .
we may have a new player from poker <UNK> .
let me know by email urllink <UNK> before friday how many you will bring so we can make sure we have enough tables .
so far we are <UNK> <UNK> <#> but can break out a 3rd table if we get more .
we did not have our normal friday night game due to charlie but the next day i headed on over to <UNK> and joined the <#> player tournament .
"i finished 4th and here the notes i emailed jeff w. > > > "" now to the 4th place finish notes ."
"it all started with my lucky "" <UNK> "" jersey ."
i wore this jersey when i finished in the money in 12th place
so i <UNK> to wear the same last sat .
: ) basically i was at break even chips when they broke up my first table .
<UNK> way i won was basically only playing level <#> hands and playing them with an all - in raise .
"in the <#> hours that i played , i got <#> pocket <UNK> , <#> pocket kings , <#> or <#> big <UNK> , and that 's about it ..."
i won all the show downs with the <#> or <#> all <UNK> that i <UNK> so i did get great cards that day which helped .
i also got a great straight draw on the river late in the tournament with an <UNK> vs <UNK> to keep me alive .
<#> ) the last play of the tournament in which i was on the big blind with a <UNK> with <#> chips left after the big blind of <#> .
no raise from the little blind ( 2nd most aggressive of the final <#> but a very <UNK> player which i learned after this trap ) .
this guy would go all - in at any sign of weakness just like the guy to my left .
after the flop of <UNK> i check with my weak <UNK> to the river which produced a <#> for my <#> pair .
so i went all in and knew i was in trouble when he immediately called me as i was reaching for my chips .
if i folded then i believe i would have made it to 3rd or more as the blind would put the other player all in .
all in all it was a great tournament and i learned alot and will try to repeat soon .
i think the key is to wait for the level <#> cards to play and play them strong and hopefully they will hold up .
the best hand of the tournament for me was getting aa on the big blind and having a mid position player go all in with <UNK> !
i won that <UNK> as well as <UNK> vs aj which got me enough chips to make it to the money .
"i 'm <UNK> that <#> - <#> chips should be enough for you to sit on to make it to the money . """
some of our league members are playing the biggest nl <UNK> in tampa bay today - the <UNK> <#> player no limit <UNK> tournament at <UNK> lanes in st .
( urllink <UNK> <#> - <#> - <#> .
<UNK> this tournament sells out at the open because they allow you to pre - register friday starting at noon .
most players purchase their seat the day before .
"since <#> weeks ago , this tournament has sold out every saturday ."
i know a player who finished 4th a few weeks ago and it paid $ <#> .
we had a good game friday night at dale 's .
"gene , a new player , won the top prize of $ <#> ."
bad beat # <#> : casey had <UNK> and the flop gave him trip kings ...
casey then goes all in and was called by <UNK> who had a pocket pair ...
<UNK> hits trips and takes casey out with a full house .
"and i feel , so much depends on the weather so is it raining in your bedroom ?"
"and i see , that these are the eyes of <UNK> would you even care ?"
"stone temple <UNK> i’ve been listening to core for the past few weeks , on and off ."
"the critics dismissed <UNK> ’s first album as a mediocre nirvana <UNK> , but what do they know ?"
"i got the cd from bill , after he found a <UNK> cd in my truck ."
<UNK> is good music to experience road rage by .
i learned to drive in boston and new york .
the campus and the job were fairly close to each other .
"so i would either drive from brooklyn ( <UNK> park area ) in my <#> <UNK> <UNK> station wagon , or take the ll train into manhattan ."
i learned to <UNK> the regular <UNK> pattern of the island ’s streets and <UNK> quite well .
"listening to the radio at high volume , and stoned more often than not ( most mornings i would take a <UNK> on the <UNK> for ‘ breakfast ” )"
", i’d laugh hearing the drivers who would scream “ your mother ! !"
” out of their windows if someone cut them off .
"that same year , i returned to boston in late october , <UNK> school , and got a part time job driving cab ."
( hack <UNK> were only $ <#> then ) .
i quit that job the same night i got robbed at <UNK> after dropping off a fare in <UNK> .
"i rarely write about my sexuality , and generally don’t post my darker <UNK> here ."
"my 4th step ( aa ) is being ( <UNK> ) completed , rather like <UNK> the gas <UNK> , and then immediately <UNK> on the brakes ."
"lots of black , smoking tire marks on the road ."
we were talking briefly on our chat yesterday about trust .
"i said that i trust myself ( sometimes ) , my cat , and my truck – but that ’s about it ."
"the walls that <#> nearly always builds around oneself are marked by bloody <UNK> marks , <UNK> those times that i tried to scale those walls ."
i suspect that i will soon be making the effort once again .
problems that occur in business processes are frequently the result of frozen accidents .
"when they do that , they become very invested in the results of those <UNK> ."
"when someone tries to later re - engineer things ( e.g. , why ca n't we just do it this way )"
", they encounter tremendous resistance due to those <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"its thesis is that , for good communication , a person should focus on not trying to control the other person ."
"let 's call this "" rogers ' style . """
an alternative to this is just telling people what to do .
"when you tell people what to do , all sorts of negative things can happen , as people skills points out ."
my guess is that powerful individuals do not practice rogers ' style communication .
"they listen , may ask for a few ideas , then tell people what to do ."
"there may be some exceptions in companies that are not currently struggling , individuals that are enlightened , or personal relationships that are warm and balanced ."
"in situations where you actually do have power , it 's just extra work to practice rogers style techniques ."
"in fact , if you 're under time <UNK> , or you have a vision that others do not buy into , <UNK> communication is in fact more effective ."
"if you 're in power , you want to be able to do what you want ."
"if you 're not in power , you want those in power to be more <UNK> to you ."
i just finished james <UNK> 's terrific the wisdom of crowds .
"the thesis is that large groups , in many different situations , can provide better <UNK> than the best individuals ."
the <UNK> example is the jelly bean count : have a group of people guess the number of jelly beans in a jar .
"the "" best "" member will not be consistent ."
"from this he <UNK> that there are no real experts , and that the crowd is better for getting the decision right ."
"the following tracks are taken from "" urllink <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> "" ( <UNK> for kids ) from <#> , performed by a children 's choir in <UNK> ."

"there is great chaos going on around you , caused by a hurricane and severe <UNK> . . ."
. there are huge masses of water all over you . . . .
you are a <UNK> photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster .
"there are houses and people floating around you , <UNK> into the water ."
nature is showing all its destroying power and is ripping everything away with it .
"you see a man in the water ; he is fighting for his life , trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud ."
suddenly you know who it is - it 's john kerry !
"at the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away , forever ."
"you can save him ... or , you can take the best photo of your life ."
"would you select color film , or rather go with the simplicity of classic black and white ?"
"i 'm so not in everyone 's league at this blog so , i 'll resume the role as comic relief ."
like it or not i do have the right to post here .
man kerry goes <UNK> and locks up the democratic nomination and the news just stops .
it 's not like there is n't lots of <UNK> .
how about the guy bush put in charge of making more jobs ?
"yep , the <#> that had just closed his u.s ."
factory and closed <UNK> <#> jobs only to <UNK> in china with <#> jobs .
i 'm not understanding how we 're supposed to believe the junk they throw out .
i actually heard <#> of them saying that sending jobs overseas was akin to computers replacing <UNK> .
have they never studied the logic of argument ?
computers replacing <UNK> is a function of higher technology replacing older tech .
"moving jobs overseas is about greedy , <UNK> assholes that care only about themselves and the dollar over the worker ."
all we want are a few good men and women .
"think it ’s a joke – you know , like urllink bush ’s <UNK> earlier this week about looking for wmd ?"
( bet urllink lori <UNK> ’s <#> small children are going to <UNK> with laughter when they’re old enough to understand . )
"reports were recently <UNK> that a "" special skills "" draft was on the table specifically for people skilled in computers and foreign languages ."
armed forces – either with a special skills or regular draft .
"rather , the agency remains prepared to manage a draft if and when the president and the congress so direct ."
"this responsibility has been ongoing since <#> and is nothing new . """
"however , the bush administration 's military goals can not be met without forced <UNK> ...."
"read more at urllink "" the coming draft ' ... and then tell me again why i should n't vote against bush in november ?"
"speaking of november , the urllink colorado democratic party <UNK> last night to ask for money ."
"in case you have n't heard ( yeah , right ) do go urllink read this ."
a county in oregon is no longer <UNK> marriage <UNK> at all .
they were threatened by the state attorney general to not issue marriage <UNK> to gay couples because it <UNK> with a state <UNK> .
she claimed that when a state <UNK> conflicts with the state constitution she just felt her hands were tied .
this is what comes of mixing religion with law .
<#> should simply never let the <UNK> religion of a country or state run it 's legal system .
simply by deciding to live by <#> code of moral conduct <#> must needs reject other perfectly respectable codes .
are yall aware that unless you have over $ <#> <UNK> the death tax will not help you ?
so all of you $ <#> <UNK> get together and try to convince yourselves of how screwed you are by the system .
there needs to be a system of income <UNK> in a system dependent on competition .
the only folks that want the death tax <UNK> do things like own walmart .
", the ones that use their vast income to <UNK> folks at <UNK> wage , and work them too few hours per week to qualify for benefits ."
.... should we reward the greedy <UNK> of society so that we can come up with the <UNK> dollars over the next decade to replace what they save ?
"yes , lets do reward the greedy <UNK> ."
do n't cha just love the new book out from <#> of the <UNK> employees ?
for years the word was that nothing ever <UNK> out of the <UNK> .
it 's kinda fun to see the assholes that used <UNK> and outright lies to <UNK> the <UNK> have to defend themselves against truth from within .
and they say there is no justice in the world .
there being so many kinds of <UNK> around these days .
political <UNK> training meeting tomorrow night that ought to be fun .
i 'm hoping that i get out without having volunteered to serve as a <UNK> lamb for a local office .
"or maybe that happens the second tuesday in april , i forget ."
truth be told i 'm hoping to run for office after i retire from the power company .
i 'm thinking county <UNK> would be a good place to start my run for the <UNK> office of the president .
urllink oppose the new <UNK> internet <UNK> request !
attorney general john <UNK> is asking the federal communications commission for sweeping new authority to <UNK> the design of internet communications services to make them easy to <UNK> .
"if implemented , this <UNK> plan would dramatically increase the government ’s <UNK> power and risk making <UNK> and privacy <UNK> much more <UNK> ."
"<UNK> ” in their systems for <UNK> and thereby create weaknesses that <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> government agents could <UNK> to invade your privacy and conduct identity theft ."
so i heard a foreign government official on the radio today being interviewed .
he said something that i thought was so obvious as to be funny .
like it 's been such a popular thing in the past and just fell out of fashion ?
sometimes the things leaders say just <UNK> me .
at this point i bet laura can put up lots of stupid things <UNK> has said .
in a political stop he <UNK> that lots of high paying jobs are now being created .
does he mean the jobs that his <UNK> ca n't ship overseas fast enough ?
highest standard of living in the free world and we can rush to make our fellow citizens poor fast enough ?
we all want the house and <#> cars and the nice tv and the cool computer .
.. but we go to walmart to get 'em ?
that means that the <UNK> is making nearly nothing to make the thing and will soon be moving jobs overseas .
"it means that the people "" helping "" you make minimum wage , have no benefits , and work maybe <#> hours a week ."
"hell , you 're probably making up what you save in state taxes to pay for the benefits your "" saving "" is <UNK> you ."
well <UNK> <UNK> get to post my opinions here too .
"yep , have to agree with my blog partner ."
that was a really good article in the link below .
quit using the legacy of the <UNK> <UNK> christian perspective to rule a country made up of so many <UNK> that it <UNK> the mind .
believe in the <UNK> of the declaration of independence and the bill of rights .
"government is about <UNK> what needs to be <UNK> , and defending the country from abusive attack ."
i ca n't think of a better way to fight terrorism than to be a united people .
rather than have texas <UNK> breaking into the houses of homosexuals to catch them having sex would n't those people have been better used by preventing the next <UNK> ?
rather than <UNK> the teaching of the theory of evolution would n't the money be better spent buying new text books ?
do n't be <UNK> by the pretty yet simple arguments .
<UNK> will find urllink this argument against ( all ) marriage interesting .
he 's been playing both sides of the gay marriage argument all week and it has been rather interesting to watch .
<UNK> says much of what <UNK> has been arguing for the last few days around here ... oh .
i 've been invited to assist in making a point !
i 'm pretty excited about this ! a place that is just about making a point and not about what i had for lunch today !
"as bill <UNK> says , it 's an exciting time to live in ."
and i 'm hoping that the democrats manage to find their voice this election season .
there is so much good to be done in the u.s .
and since we 've had the <UNK> for far too long it 's time for someone that believes the u.s .
should be on the world stage as a good partner and not the biggest bully on the block .
i 'm right now so pumped that <UNK> is running for the u.s .
i would love to see a crack in the republican armor of this far - too - conservative state .
and i would love to see the <UNK> body of the senate back in the hands of the democrats .
and i 'd like to use less run on sentences .
president george w. bush has marked international women 's week by paying tribute to women <UNK> -- but <#> of those he <UNK> is really a man .
urllink there is a great deal right about kerry <UNK> not in a bad way !
"urllink joe <UNK> : ' bush had friends , but martha had none ' this pretty much says what i have been saying for months ."
what am i supposed to do with all these <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> ?
"by richard adams though many think of you as a bit young , even childish , you 're actually incredibly deep and complex ."
"you show people the need to <UNK> their <UNK> , and confront them on everything from how they think to where they build their houses ."
you might be <#> of the greatest people of all time .
you 'd be recognized as such if you were n't always talking about talking rabbits .
take the urllink book quiz at the urllink blue <UNK> .
"ya see , i think it is down right <UNK> and poor <UNK> to ignore politics - especially so <#> can "" feel better "" ."
this kind of attitude is how we got the urllink resident evil in office in the first place .
evil of all kinds <UNK> on our not being willing to confront it .
"<UNK> fight the good fight , leave the planet a little better than you found it ?"
"at the moment , they are <UNK> everything i think is good about our country ."
it <UNK> make me feel any better to ignore it .
"it just makes me , makes us , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , i think i 'm busted -- i do hate our president -- and a few others as well ."
"that is certainly not what 's best for us all , much less my psyche ."
which brings me to the big ole <UNK> over pictures of flag <UNK> <UNK> being delivered to <UNK> air force base in <UNK> .
"as an interesting aside my brother used to be an air force <UNK> , he <UNK> these same kind of <UNK> ."
these people gave their lives for something they believe in .
i think it 's a really wrong war <UNK> by the worst <UNK> in the history of the united states .
"but i 've been in the military , i know what kind of people are coming back in the <UNK> ."
then he counts himself done with the whole messy process and goes on to kill someone elses child .
the least we can do is see them . at least once .
"<UNK> <#> info , <#> <UNK> wars , a <UNK> economy , global <UNK> ."
lately the <UNK> and comics have been pointing out the <UNK> of the bush white house .
like the fact that the <UNK> <UNK> and it 's <UNK> are claiming the document that came out shortly before <#> was simply a historical document .
they <UNK> that there was nothing in it to indicate that there was an <UNK> threat .
"and they 're right , <UNK> in it , but they really <UNK> read the title ."
the thing in the big bold letters above everything else that said osama bin laden intended to attack the u.s .
or i suppose it would have been if he were in a country that had huge underground oil <UNK> .
"and now i 'm coming up short on ideas , i had plenty of examples when i started out ."
there 's really no end of entertainment value from this bunch of <UNK> .
they <UNK> the most insane crap and do it with a straight face and hope that the sincere tone will carry it thru for them .
like this whole attacking john kerry about going to vietnam and then <UNK> .
"he did n't run , he served as required ."
then when he came back he <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> right of free speech and <UNK> what he thought was a wrong war .
at least if john kerry sends troops into battle he will know what it is he 's sending them into .
they keep getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar and then acting like no <#> <UNK> have the <UNK> to notice .
"it 's really funny , or would be if it were n't so sad ."
"<UNK> , do not read urllink this ."
"in which case , you might find it <UNK> ( <UNK> ! a pun ! )"
these people are too invested in making everyone feel really badly about <UNK> and then blaming the victims .
i 'm thinking what satan can not do is laugh at himself . or
"that would involve a capacity for compassion and joy , the scandal of it all !"
the mistakes just keep <UNK> up for this bunch of <UNK> .
and i do n't find it at all hard to believe that <UNK> ca n't think of a single mistake he 's made .
folks that operate in his type circles just seem to think themselves above petty things like personal responsibility .
"it 's funny , you 'd think being president of the u.s ."
would mean that <#> would feel incredibly personally responsible .
the last <#> that seemed to think so was james <UNK> carter .
i suppose bill clinton thought some things he did were mistakes .
i find it odd that the <UNK> are trying to lay sept 11th at his feet .
last i checked the bush <UNK> had been in charge for about <#> months before that happened .
"also , if i recall correctly , bill clinton put out a kill order on osama , that seems to indicate his <UNK> did take the threat seriously ."
"oh well , it 'll sure be interesting to see what happens next ."
"bush concluded : "" i do n't want to sound like i have made no mistakes ."
-- telling the american people that iraq definitely possessed wmd . --
troops into <UNK> <UNK> to capture osama bin laden in november <#> .
"just for fun , let 's look at the present u.s ."
citizens on the <UNK> in iraq fighting and dying for their masters .
their masters serve the gods of greed and power .
the blood <UNK> into the <UNK> of iraq feeds the power of those gods .
"the locals are feeding the <UNK> in like manner , blood sacrifices to their own gods ."
the power shifts according to who is willing to make the largest sacrifices .
how well the sacrifice works depends very much upon the intention of the offering .
"scattered energy gifts , not so well directed ."
"we want a united , free , democratic iraq ."
"well , <UNK> , the <UNK> and the <UNK> are <UNK> to fight the <UNK> americans ."
for just a moment look from outside the box .
the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a plus .
"yes , <UNK> to fight us , but <UNK> it still is ."
direct the <UNK> force so that it turns into the direction you wish it to go .
this would include us being willing to look like we were getting beaten as long as it continued to serve our purpose .
the way of the peaceful and all that crap .
"amazing what could be accomplished if we removed the ego driven , white <UNK> <UNK> christian philosophy from the equation ."
of course it 's much like asking the <UNK> to change
"it 's spots , but then when the <UNK> is losing"
it 's ass it <UNK> the <UNK> to try something different .
saw a bit of the interview with <UNK> rice .
i just knew what was gonna happen when she insisted upon telling the commission what it was there for in the very beginning .
it <UNK> the incredible arrogance of the present <UNK> .
there are many ways to interpret the proper use of power .
the present gang of carpet <UNK> apparently believe the proper way to exercise the incredible power of the u.s .
"of a. is to go forward sure of themselves , asking for no help or advice from the rest of the world ."
they would appear to have decided that this end justified the mean they chose .
"government , <UNK> the entire rest of the world , and <UNK> the rights of the citizens they are charged with serving ."
"yes , all that i got from her opening statements ."
some folks can <UNK> nothing from an entire set of <UNK> .
i believe <#> can understand the universe from reading a gum <UNK> .
the <UNK> that were supposed to be our ace in the hole have apparently decided that they really do want a <UNK> .
"ya know , we 're the ones who think there is no other good government than the <#> of democracy ."
that system of thought that says what i think must be right .
"so now , <#> day soon , the <UNK> of the <UNK> will tell his followers to rise up and throw out the damned <UNK> ."
that 's what we are in the middle east you know .
"so , since we 've invaded their country and now occupy it they have <UNK> sitting in their holy world ."
if you have <UNK> in your home you <UNK> them .
"from "" act for change "" : urllink <UNK> mayor <UNK> as assistant secretary of <UNK> urllink draft the bush twins first"
urllink <UNK> seeks comment on proposed rules regarding political committee status
"<UNK> did n't fail because it was a bad idea , it failed for the same reason the north won the civil war and the u.s ."
the winner simply out produced the weapons and people it took to win .
"they know we 'll pay any price up to and including <#> bucks a gallon without changing our habits <UNK> , it 's been widely reported ."
so then what do you do in an election year when <#> of the guys who is running is prone to getting his gun off ?
"you ruin the economy , raise the unemployment rate , and cause wide criticism of his policies which have led to the high prices ."
"because while we 'll pay it , we complain each and every time the price goes up a penny ."
"well , here we are , another military holiday in the land of the free ."
<#> of the major holidays of the year are all about the soldiers ?
"<#> for the living , <#> for the dead ."
of course the 4th of july is really a celebration of the declaration of war .
and thanksgiving is the beginning of a war of <UNK> .
so i guess we celebrate lots more death and war than peace and love .
somehow i wish it was the other way around .
would it really be so bad to wage peace ?
"to care for the weak , protect the minority , pour ourselves into a rising tide that raises all boats ?"
and an often repeated thought out in the world is that the fact that many of <UNK> folks are muslim is somehow what makes it ok .
it 's always good to look in the mirror .
tends to keep the <UNK> to a dull <UNK> .
since when did god tell anyone to invade iraq and bomb wedding parties ?
george bush keeps <UNK> gods name all over the place .
heck at least god knows the names of the folks that die .
and actually knows the names regardless of their place in the kingdom .
"nice thought that , that god knows your name ."
", george wo n't even go look at the bodies of the men and women he 's <UNK> in his holy war for oil ."
"i 'm just left wondering , "" where 's the <UNK> "" ?"
"the guy <UNK> claims to be doing gods work by <UNK> the muslim <UNK> lands , and no <#> calls him on it ?"
went up yesterday after <#> and got the worst possible hotel room to stay in .
"<UNK> made out well , hers was on the side where the <UNK> was but mine faced the <UNK> side of a big ole k - mart ."
the bottom of my outside wall was plastic and let in all the light from the cars pulling up out front .
<#> of the beds had a <UNK> bottle cap on it .
i had to <UNK> stuff to plug the tv in .
"the beds were <UNK> , the colors were horrid and every jackass in the hotel had to keep calling my room all night looking for someone named jerry ."
"ok , maybe it only happened <#> times but at least once the dude was drunk off his ass and wanted to argue that i really was jerry ."
now you do understand that you have to convince the drunk that you 're not jerry in this case or the a hole will keep calling back .
at least until 5:30 am when he had <UNK> up and forgot that he 'd called at 2:30 am also .
i was an alternate but ended up getting to vote on everything that came up on saturday !
so i got to vote for dennis <UNK> like i wanted .
"and i voted for ken <UNK> for the senate race , but only because i 'd promised i would ."
i 've now decided that i 'll work on the campaign of mike miles .
he was simply fantastic . and spoke to all the issues i care about .
"it was sure fun , even though i ended up in big rooms full of people all crowded together ."
goodness but that bath is gonna feel good tonight .
"told stories , and made jokes and touched hearts ."
it 's a lot more interesting if you hear the whole thing rather than the bits and pieces you see on tv .
we 'll just have to see what happens next .
usually not about religion and so far never about sex .
anyone really want to hear me talk about sex ?
i 'm going to the state democratic convention this weekend for a bit .
sure it 's pie in the sky but i love pie in the sky .
always tastes better with a bit more atmosphere on it if you ask me .
then it 'll be home for more yard work .
"the bright spot is , of course , seeing my <UNK> ."
i 'll get to take my shiny new ebay truck to <UNK> and back !
"sure , sure i know they have a wonderful selling point ."
... just look at all the empty hotel rooms !
"it does n't really explain why the state fair is held there , but i guess it 's a start ."
why do i think <UNK> is n't a world famous destination spot ?
i got some <UNK> <UNK> for the union election i 'm in .
if i win it means i go to denver once a month for meetings .
"ok , now it 's time to talk about sex !"
"see , i just knew you did n't wanna hear about that ."
laura just <UNK> me an article about the torture going on in iraq .
i 've been meaning to comment on this but now i 'm compelled .
i 'll quickly <UNK> that i was in the military from <#> to <#> .
"i did n't have to kill anyone , but i did interact with tons of folks that did ."
he joined the service in which he knew he would n't be called on to serve his country .
it was the <UNK> way out of the conflict .
"brave men and women went to vietnam or <UNK> to canada , they did not pretend to serve ."
"war is hell , you can ask anyone that 's been in <#> ."
all the rules and regulations go out the window when the shooting starts .
"so the kids over in iraq tortured , raped and <UNK> the iraqis under their control ."
in vietnam they would take prisoners up in the <UNK> and ask the first handy <#> a question .
before he had the chance to answer they 'd pitch is ass out the door to die screaming as he hit the dirt .
the next <#> to be <UNK> would start answering the second he was picked out of the bunch .
and there were things done that were much worse .
bush does n't know shit about going to war .
he knows how to blow up the hardware with high tech weapons and <UNK> guided <UNK> .
what he does n't know is what it costs .
and i 'm not talking about the dollars and cents he did n't provide in the first place .
take a look at the <UNK> in the office of the president .
"he says shit like "" bring 'em on "" to terrorists and then sends them your children on a <UNK> ."
"he sends your children to die without <UNK> <UNK> , without supplies like proper food , and without thinking about the true costs of doing so ."
he hid out from war in the guard and then sends them over for longer than anyone was forced to serve in vietnam .
because then the true cost of war comes home .
it 's no longer mostly poor people with no choices serving along side the occasional wealthy patriot .
"now it 's everyone , on every block that can die ."
"now , sticking a flag on your car is n't enough to be a patriot ."
"it 's cheap patriotism that is , no cost ."
"now , if there 's a draft , you might actually have to die for what you beleive in ."
i will return soon to bring back the <UNK> to the new template .
"so , i was listening to michael moore on howard stern this <UNK> well , i almost actually liked him ."
i mean he almost made sense to me and have i told ya i 'm a registered republican .
i think the <UNK> is tapping my phone lines now .
about <#> years too fucking late if you ask me .
"the man that lead the conservative revolution , drove us to the <UNK> of <UNK> and brought us iran - <UNK> ."
as <#> of my co workers said today ?
i watched reagan work what he called supply side economics .
it was really spend - yourself - out - of - a - depression economics .
cut taxes and run giant <UNK> to spend your way out and let the future generations pay for it .
i think that must be where the <UNK> got it .
just plain people lucky enough to have been born into a pretty free country .
i was reminded of this listening to npr today .
someone was complaining about iraq and the new government to be installed there .
their point was the role of women . that they should be equal .
this country did n't have <UNK> for over a <#> years for women and <#> years for african americans after we won the war of <UNK> .
but all of a sudden the country we invaded should come out of the cultural dark ages in a couple of years ?
are they that much more advanced than we are ?
i say that because we do n't have equality yet .
women do n't get paid the same as men ( unless they 're union and that is a socialist organization anyway ) .
people of color do n't get the same treatment and opportunities as white men .
"you cross the street to avoid <UNK> with teen age black kids , do n't you ?"
if they want to change they 'll do so .
"yep , <UNK> is good , showing is good , examples are good ."
"no not the kind where we torture them in <UNK> , but the other kind ."
that sure self knowledge that i did n't get where i am over night and i should n't expect it of you .
had our first meeting of the upper level of the san <UNK> valley regional <UNK> for mike miles for senate .
see the longer your title the more important you are .
as we were making plans at the local <UNK> things just kept falling for other folks to do .
<UNK> is in charge of data and the administration and <UNK> of how it flows and what flows from it .
<UNK> is in charge of keeping the democratic party honest during the primary .
she 's also gonna get us some applications for local <UNK> and <UNK> .
"of course at <#> point they looked at me and asked , "" what are you going to do "" ?"
"dang , no slipping under the wire with those <#> !"
i 've been <UNK> to get info and stuff sent down .
"so , i 've been kinda of quiet here lately ."
"all i can can really contribute is that i have updated my voter registration and well , who i 'll vote for in november might surprise you ."
i know you 'll be on the edge of your seats until <UNK> might even pee your pants .
the house i was building in my heart ; the house i wanted to live in .
"the house i was desperately wanting to make my home , never to pack again , never to change the locks ever ."
"and , it does n't matter how the fire started ."
maybe the <UNK> had been <UNK> all along and it was only a matter of time before * <UNK> * ! !
"and , it was n't as comfortable as i wish it had been , although i did try to improve it ."
"it needed paint and it was way , way off the main road so that if you did n't know it was there , you never saw it ."
"and , i 'll believe this until the day i die , the foundation was strong ."
"oh , god , how i loved that house ."
it was just the perfect size and the color of <UNK> . when it happened
"if you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm , it <UNK> away with a single flip of its tail ."
love is n't what these asshole <UNK> like <UNK> want you to think it is .
"love has teeth ; they bite ; the wounds never close . "" that 's how i feel right now ."
"after i knew my house had burned , i cried like a baby ."
"i was parked in a fucking bank parking lot and i cried , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> like a baby ."
"and , it does n't matter what i say , it does n't matter how i put it or what language i use ."
"as much as i love words , they suck ass when trying to explain it ."
i 've always been pretty much <UNK> when it comes to emotions .
my motto has always been that people will do what they want to do .
"and it 's the sense i 've always applied to my "" relationships . """
if that 's what you can call them .
they <UNK> out of my life with <UNK> filled of self - righteousness and self - justification .
"and , i feel as if i 'm left <UNK> to drown of anger and bitterness and hurt ."
"i 'll <UNK> the loss of my home , the loss of my comfort and love ."
then ..... tomorrow i 'm gonna wake up and stop feeling sorry for myself .
i 'm going to go look for a part - time job .
"i 'm gonna <UNK> my eyebrows , do my laundry , the dishes and shave my legs ."
i 've been depressed and have been letting a lot of things go .
"if there were ever a time when i 've needed to make a new life for myself , it 's now ."
i 'm going to do my hair and i will not hang my head .
"a stronger house , with carefully installed <UNK> and fire <UNK> placed , <UNK> , all around ."
"and , i will not shed <#> more tear over the dwelling that <UNK> in ashes at my feet today ."
"the home that , despite everyone 's efforts , was n't taken care of enough to keep it from burning ."
i will take a deep breath and walk quietly away from my heart 's <UNK> .
what is it about working a normal work week that makes the weekend into a <UNK> diamond by tuesday afternoon .
there are no mistakes when you <UNK> a weekend .
i want to find a part - time job .
"i wish i could get a temporary part - time job , but i ca n't find <#> , as of yet ."
"for some reason , i 'm remembering my mother and sister 's recent trip to the south of texas to visit family ."
"it was a funeral and my mother , my sister and my father went ."
the thing i was thinking about was their rental car .
"i do n't know how it happened , but they rented a non - smoking car ."
my father and mother both smoke like trains .
"when they got back from the trip , my mother insisted on cleaning the car and <UNK> over whether to tell the rental company about the smoking ."
dawn came and it was time to take the car back .
"i followed them so i could bring them back in my car and before they went in , they stopped by my window . """
"okay , "" my mother said to my sister , "" if they do n't ask about it , we 're not gonna tell them . """
""" but , "" my mother 's voice <UNK> up , "" if they ask ...."
"my mother , satisfied with the agreed - upon procedure , <UNK> her back and looked off toward the rental office , her <UNK> <#> ready for warfare ."
i do n't know why i was thinking about that today .
maybe because i 'm running low and cigarettes and have to decide if i want to buy more or not .
"potatoes , <UNK> , onions , tomatoes , <UNK> .... all the <UNK> for a feast ."
i 've almost made it half - month .
"now , it 's sunny skies , yet again ."
i 'm going to go to ego 's tonight .
"even the $ <#> to get in is a lot of money for me these days , but i just love to see the <UNK> get up and perform ."
it 's <UNK> and i 'm at work .
i have a doctor 's appointment today at <UNK> .
doctor 's appointments for <UNK> employees who ride the bus to work are <UNK> and <UNK> things .
"were it up to me , i would be able to go to the doctor on saturday or i 'd forever be going to emergency <UNK> ."
"this is a follow - up type of thing , however , and i 've <UNK> it twice ."
he walked around like he was as hard as stone .
"mentally and emotionally , there 's no way to get near him ."
"you know , you open that clear <UNK> and you touch it ."
"before you <UNK> it , it seemed like a little hard <UNK> , then you put it in your mouth and <UNK> <UNK> !"
it 's soft and <UNK> and <UNK> and rich and sweet .
"well , whatever . it 's gonna be hell having to get off campus , to my doctor 's appointment , then back again ."
"if i do nothing else , i know , i 've gotten my walk in ."
"plus , there 's something sexy about walking down congress , knowing i 'm not a tourist , that i live and breathe among everyone there ."
that i have a right to my part of the sidewalk .
just a sip or <#> and it 's as if i 've been born again .
"of course , now i 'll be up until midnight .... but , who cares ?"
it 's $ <#> to get in and it 's highly entertaining .
"usually , i tend to get bored before the shouting dies down , but this happens to be a very pumped up shin - dig ."
", okay .... that was just me doing that free - flowing thing ."
i 'm not quoting any of the real <UNK> .
"but , mostly , they 're just really good ."
there 's <#> thing that i truly respect about artists and actors and <UNK> and anyone that gets up on the stage to perform for random strangers .
"and , it 's not always the material or the ability of the act or <UNK> ."
it 's their own fierce belief in themselves .
"the joke , act , play may fall flat , but they 're up there ."
all the different colors and <UNK> to choose from !
it 's similar to the feeling <#> has the first morning after they 've been sick . not <UNK> sick or anything .
"but , <UNK> sick , with <UNK> or something ."
"they 've been able to function , but they 've been <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> feeling hot and <UNK> to cold and <UNK> ."
"nothing major , just present enough to make you feel <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"i feel clear and rested and relieved that my <UNK> can be put away , at least for a while ."
so many things are up in the air right now .
"where i 'll be living , my money situation , etc ."
"but , i feel as if the major things have been sorted out at last ."
i know that i am single and do n't mind that i am .
"i mean , really .... without exercising some force of will on the other person , it 's just a situation that has no solution ."
i know that the next place i live will be the place i stay at for a long time .
i 've decided that i want to be a better sister and daughter .
"i want to be a better friend to the small group of sweet , though <UNK> individuals that i call friends now ."
"i want to make more friends and get out into the world , experience whatever comes my way ; things that i have n't even thought of now ."
i 've seen people do it ( hundreds of them ! all at the same time )
"not for profit or success , but because it has been the <#> constant in my life that i 've always taken for granted ."
i think it should be like brushing your teeth or <UNK> your <UNK> ( without the toe - jam ) .
when i write i discover so much about myself .
"i am not a <UNK> the way i am a writer , but i can paint ."
"i can create something out of nothing and it becomes something worthy of interest .... at least mine , anyway ."
i 'm having such a love - fest with myself lately .
"sure , there are others who 'll disagree with me , but , who the hell are they ?"
"i 'm here to tell you that i 've got a great , big heart and there is n't anything i would n't do for the people i love ."
"i 'm not the best person , but i 'm pretty damn good . and , besides .... who is the best person"
"cuz , i know for sure it is n't me ."
( sniff ) when i set my mind on something ...
there 's so many things i should be doing right now .
i should put away the laundry that seems destined to <UNK> with my pink chair .
"yes , i 'm working on a story ."
"mondays are a strange time for me , though ."
"i do n't ever want to do anything on mondays . """
"rainy days and mondays al - ways get me - e <UNK> "" gosh , i 'm so old ."
"anything from barry <UNK> is like <UNK> now , when in the <#> 's , it was the height of soul ."
there are so many songs i miss that i have n't heard in ages .
""" i remember when rock was young ... .... "" dust in the wind ?"
"come on , you know it . all those songs were so innocent . or it seemed that they were at the time , anyway ."
how else are you going to grab the attention of people these days ?
i 'm gonna move into a new apartment soon .
"i do n't think i said that right , but i 'm excited ."
"type over <#> <UNK> and i hardly ever stop to <UNK> , but i 'm sure i got the idea across ."
that extended - extended package has the music channels that i long for .
i used to leave it on all the time when i had more money and was insane .
"now , i just do n't have as much money ."
"soon , after i move , i will not want to move for a very long time ."
"i will want to settle down , maybe get a mate and have some <UNK> - <UNK> ."
"i know i 've been dreading this move , b <UNK> i welcome it now ."
i want to leave where i 've been .
"i 'll miss this place , but where i 'm going will be better ."
the month is almost half - way over .
"thanks be to god the world is wide and i am going far from home and , i 'll forget in <UNK> the man i loved in rome ."
ever wake up with something burning in your head that wo n't leave you alone until you do it ?
i woke up at <UNK> ! who does that ?
"finally , i ended up just opening my eyes and doing it , but then i could n't go back to sleep ."
"and i 've eaten my cereal , toast and coffee ."
i have to catch the bus at <UNK> .
"why is it that some thoughts , once they make their way into your <UNK> , have the power to disturb , <UNK> , <UNK> your actions ?"
"and , other thoughts do n't seem to have any power at all ."
i 've just gotten back from walking around town lake and grocery shopping and am about to bake a cake and clean my apartment ( i am ....
i am ! ) . walking down the trail i look at all the people running and in different <UNK> of <UNK> .
"i 'm <UNK> ( is that the right word ? ) by everyone i see , just about ."
there are women that look twice my age running .
"i 've <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> , but .... running ?"
after i 've been at it for <#> or so minutes i feel lighter .
i feel like my lungs can process air quicker ...
"my legs do n't feel as <UNK> , my back does n't hurt ."
after <#> minutes i feel like i can walk for days .
"maybe when i lose more weight i 'll feel at the start of my walk , they way i now do <#> minutes into it ."
"it 's enough for me to walk right now , though ."
it helps me feel as if i have n't spent the entire day in my apartment .
"when i got in line to check out , i found myself behind a group of what was , obviously , mexican <UNK> ."
"and , not <#> of them had a woman ."
everything they had could be cooked on a grill or in a microwave .
"they had <UNK> ( gas stove owners - bastards ! ) , meat , <UNK> noodles , tv dinners , meat , beer , toilet paper and ...."
"plus , it 's a dead <UNK> that they were the ones doing the shopping ."
"shopping , by and large , is a woman 's job ."
we 're the ones that know how to cook <#> % of the time .
"selection - but , believe me on this - city market is cheaper -- cheaper by lots ) ."
do any of you know that it takes approximately $ <#> to make a cake ?
"the mix is about $ <#> , the icing is $ <#> ."
"throw in the price of an egg and some milk , butter to grease the pan and electricity to bake it and ...."
"<UNK> , mon <UNK> , you 've got yourself a cake ."
i 'm always surprised by the extent to which my apartment gets dirty .
what i want to do is try to weed some things out .
"well , i 've done enough dragging home , i think ( she said , taking a look around ) ."
it 's time to weed out what is n't necessary .
i 've lived in this apartment on s 1st for nearly a year now
i like that no <#> can see inside ( i live on the 3rd floor ) .
i like that trees hang just outside my window and i can leave the windows wide open ( although i shut them now that it 's so hot ) .
"i 've liked sitting on my patio and drinking my coffee , smoking my cigarettes ( which i 'm thinking of quitting ) ."
"i 've found an apartment that is $ <#> a month , with free extended cable and paid <UNK> water ."
"i , currently , pay $ <#> and pay for the cable and water ."
"if you factor in all that , i 'll be paying about $ <#> less a month !"
"so , that 's another $ <#> - <#> off ."
someone once told me that he saw no point in a person 's daily <UNK> .
i do n't think a person 's private thoughts should all be for an audience .
"but , i also do n't think a person 's private world should be <UNK> by an audience , either ."
"what you do in life should be your world , for better or worse ; flawed or whole ; <UNK> or <UNK> ."
"it should be yours , not to be explained or apologized for ."
"i 'll fart and tell you about it , i may describe the smell ."
"i 'll try to capture my intense love and affection for my father , the <UNK> for all men after him ."
"and , how i <UNK> and admire my mother ."
"and , how i can still see them as human ."
"but , i 'll make you seem wise in comparison ."
i 'll make bad <UNK> ; bad fashion choices ; <UNK> .
"mine will not be a world where everything is done "" just so "" ."
"i 'll burn my potatoes , get flat tires , bad <UNK> and <UNK> gas ..... which leaves us where we started ."
"i 'll put this all down , not because i 'm vain ( i mean .... i am vain , but that 's not the reason to write ) ."
it is the milk - of - <UNK> for my soul .
"and , you have a front - row ticket ."
"you know , i just ca n't win ."
"i shower , i <UNK> <UNK> the hair , i take the <UNK> stuff out of my eyes ."
"i dress , put on make - up and <UNK> ."
"i give it , if not my all , a lot ."
"since i started my new job , i 've been walking home ."
i 've got the nasty hammer toes now .
"my heels all have <UNK> on them , i have <UNK> places from where my shoes rubbed too much ."
let 's talk about something that i 'm finding increasingly annoying .
the reason i find it annoying is because it <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> in the psyche and the results are raw and harsh .
there 's no logic or <UNK> that will prevent <UNK> toward those who are overweight or will take away the <UNK> of being a <UNK> .
"<#> - <#> pounds may not sound like a lot , but the weight i 've lost has been <UNK> and i 've worked out more , walked constantly ."
"i , personally , did not like how big i was getting ."
i could n't put my arms down without feeling the rolls around my tummy .
that 's an ugly feeling that i did n't want to have .
"i was unhappy with myself , how i looked and felt ,"
"i turned my world upside down , but now i 'm in a position where i walk every day and it 's part of getting home ."
the weight is coming off faster and i am keeping it off and will continue to do so .
i 'm very happy that i 'm losing weight .
that does n't mean that i 'm still not <UNK> by the public response and perception .
"and , the dismay i feel is just <UNK> by the fact that i know .... i know reality will not change perception ."
"what i mean is that , look around , america is getting <UNK> ."
"even the teenagers in their <UNK> , cha - cha - cha get ups are <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"and , overweight men are <UNK> into the entertainment and media we view on tv like water out of a fist ."
i believe that there are more women who are overweight than men .
"having said this , however , i still think that there are a lot of fat men <UNK> the streets ."
"they 've all , regardless of race ( with the exception of <UNK> ) , getting more and more overweight ."
"but , even though this is a reality , it 's the woman 's value that is affected in direct proportion to how much they weigh ."
"weight , in women , is like location with real estate ."
"and , the less you weigh , the better the location ."
"with the last <#> pounds i 've lost , i seem to have wandered just north of <UNK> in central austin ."
another <#> and i 'll inch my way across ben white .
"in <#> , <UNK> be prime , north of <UNK> , between s 1st and <UNK> ."
"hell , man , it 'll be like <UNK> a <UNK> on the river ."
"men react in a collective wave , almost as if they need to know another man sees me as being worth to hit on ."
"at <#> , i did n't have a specific group of men <UNK> over me ."
"suddenly , at <#> , i 've got the shy guys and the bit <UNK> guys hitting on me ."
i 've got the older mexican men that pass by in their <UNK> trucks and <UNK> at me .
"and , the worse thing to know is that i 'll never again have a particular knowledge about a man ."
i <UNK> that it is only now that i 'm getting attention and i know the resentment will only grow with the attention .
"but , i know it 's coming . i 've not always been big ."
"and , i do n't know what to do about it ."
"( o is <#> months , k is <#> months and c is nearly <#> ) somewhere over <UNK> i began laughing <UNK> ."
"while we were so <UNK> <UNK> across the <UNK> , both our girls were busy <UNK> and <UNK> their way through every <UNK> and outfit i had packed ."
let me start at the beginning of the day 's journey .
"we made good time , got the van returned and all our stuff into the airport by the <#> o'clock mark we 'd set ."
"that 's why the babies get on free , right ?"
because it 's so <UNK> for the parents that the <UNK> do n't charge for the little monsters .
"we check our bags and began walking around , looking for a spot to have some lunch and kill some time ."
"k is sleeping happily , o is being charming and <UNK> ."
"o needed a change after lunch due to food and drink spilled , but she did learn how to drink from a straw while we were there ! ! !"
she played hard for well over a half an hour .
"k continued to sleep <UNK> , but around this point kevin and i began to wonder if this was really such a good thing ."
"o soaked a pair of her shorts and had to have another change , but i was n't too worried ."
"i 'd packed <#> changes of clothes for her and <#> for k , plus at least about <#> <UNK> between them ."
"o was beginning to show signs of impending <UNK> , a good thing ( <#> would think ) as we were only about <#> minutes away from departure time ."
"as i watched o rubbing her eyes and <UNK> to my knees and k starting to <UNK> and fuss , a sense of dread began to creep over me ."
"lame attempt at humour , sadly i was thinking it might not be such a bad idea ."
i think it was just after this that i noticed o 's <UNK> seemed rather <UNK> ( again ) and k started power <UNK> .
"i can change a <UNK> in the blink of an eye now , with the <UNK> sitting , standing or laying down ."
k chose this particular moment to turn her head and spit up most of her last meal all over the front of my shirt and down into my pocket .
good thing i packed a change of shirt for myself .
too bad i thought i would n't need it and packed it at the very bottom of my carry on .
"he took o , and i took k. only to discover that the <UNK> by the boarding gates do not have change tables ! ! !"
( at this point i still cared about what people might be thinking .
"fortunately for her , k did n't . )"
"and this particular change involved an entire change of clothes too , poop was halfway up her back ."
"uh , i am thinking that is us ."
"we need assistance , no doubt about it ."
"o is upset that her juice is gone , as well as picking up on her daddy 's increasing stress ."
i lost track of it with all the fun going on .
"we all get seated , the crew gets the air conditioning working and we try to get settled in ."
they give us k 's car seat back and i am flooded with gratitude and relief .
c has been dying to get seated and read his new books and look at his new games
"i 'm wishing for a bit more cool air , but overall we are ok ."
we thought ahead and bought subway <UNK> to bring with us for dinner since they do n't serve meals on the flight .
o is getting a bit <UNK> from all the excitement and everything
as soon as the <UNK> lights go off i 'll change her ... which brings us to somewhere over <UNK> .
"o has had several <UNK> changes , the flight is only about half over and she still wo n't go to sleep ."
i feel <UNK> <UNK> all over my feet and legs .
"o is <UNK> , it is <UNK> on the change counter and running down all over the toilet and the floor ."
"although we save a <UNK> this way , her outfit gets soaked because it 's on the counter next to her ."
i mentally note that we have only <#> more change of clothes for her .
"i get back to the seat , k wakes up ( fortunately she 'd gone back to sleep shortly after take off ) and <UNK> ."
"many <UNK> smiles , not too many <UNK> or heavy sighs ."
"kevin needs a new outfit for k. i send c back with <#> , ( what a good kid ) ."
i just want to sit for a minute .
she seems to be ready to go back to sleep .
"o on the other hand , does not ."
"she flops around , in every position <UNK> , trying to get comfortable ."
"somehow , the rest of the flight passes ."
"my butt goes to sleep , my arm does too ."
kevin <UNK> around the plane for about an hour with k after getting her <UNK> changed again until she fell back to sleep .
we got in to vancouver with <#> <UNK> left for o and no changes of clothes .
we get our luggage and picked up our van .
everyone was happy to be off the plane and going home .
"having never had the opportunity to eat our <UNK> , we are nearly starving ."
we will grab some quick take out when we get home .
the <UNK> are <UNK> and not very appealing sounding now .
"we wonder how the animals are doing , whether our good friend m had any troubles or not ."
"we pull up to the house , only to see m 's car in the drive ."
kevin goes in ahead to say hi and see how things are going .
as i 'm <UNK> babies and bags he comes back out to tell me that m is on the floor in our bedroom passed out .
he thinks we should call <#> ... turns out she had <UNK> stroke .
"she is fine now , after a trip to the hospital in an ambulance and about a gallon of fluid pumped into her ."
this morning i woke up and it looks like hell <UNK> broken loose in my house .
i 've been doing the ebay thing for a couple months now
"and it is helping to pay some of the bills , although i 've been lazy in listing anything new lately ."
we went to a huge community yard sale this past weekend and i found the most amazing <UNK> toys !
"<#> that tells you to toss it and when you do it goes "" <UNK> "" ! and then the other <#> tells you that you 're his sweetheart ...."
i may end up keeping that <UNK> . and a very cute <UNK> - face purse that some little girl is just gonna love having .
all i 've gotta do is take pics and get them developed .
the only <UNK> to having this ebay thing in full <UNK> is the fact that my house looks like <UNK> on a tuesday morning ! !
"baby shoes , clothes , toys , <UNK> name it ."
"i clean ( totally clean , to the point of exhaustion ) at least once a week ."
"but in a matter of only <#> day , its back to it 's original chaotic ruin ."
the fact that i 'm a <UNK> saying this makes me shudder .
.... i 've found that if i keep my favorite room in the house <UNK> ( the kitchen )
i 'm perfectly content to let the other areas go .
"well , of <UNK> the exception of the bathroom . that room has no business being a <UNK> 's just nasty ."
i 've also been continuing in learning the definitions to new words that my very dear friend and i started a few months ago .
i think today 's word is ' <UNK> ' .
i think it has something to do with being totally opposite .
but i 'll get the definition and post it in here so i do n't forget .
", i 'm finding that it 's becoming my reality ."
there 's nothing in the world better than having a place to throw your thoughts down .
it makes room for other things that are waiting for their turn in your head .
this is going to be a form of release .
"it shot across the sky in just a matter of a second or <#> , but the image is still lingering in my mind ."
there 's something peaceful yet <UNK> in seeing something like that .
"while camping in a very beautiful part of se ohio , on a dock that has a virtually <UNK> view of the sky , my partner was fishing ."
i laid down on the dock and just stared at the sky not saying a word .
"as leo and <UNK> continued their eternal chase , out of the corner of my eye , i saw it ."
"the light made me gasp and say very loudly , "" did you see it ? ? """
"it was n't long before she was laying beside me , fishing abandoned , and we were <UNK> into a sky that continued to light up ."
"the whole time we were there , i was torn between feeling completely content in my surroundings and the <UNK> thoughts of kyle leaving for the marines ."
it 's weird to feel relaxed in a way and at the same time depressed .
i 'll leave a dream or <#> that i 've been having related to that .
"welcome to my blog about life in israel , with comments and analysis from a personal perspective ."
"so for a first posting , i 'm sharing a note i sent the other day to a pro - palestinian friend ."
i invite you to peek ; i 've changed the names and <UNK> to protect the guilty .
"-- dear ---- : in light of and following our meeting and conversations , i’m glad to be on your email list and to read your reflections ."
"he states , therefore , that “ if we want to remain alive , we will have to <UNK> ”"
"it ’s a prediction , not a call for murder akin to the “ kill jews wherever you find them ” real <UNK> to murder from muslim <UNK> ."
"i would welcome , on other issues , an opportunity to better understand your perspective , as <#> of your postings have raised my eyebrows recently ."
"you call for a <UNK> of violence , for instance , from <UNK> israel <UNK> from , in another of your postings ."
"( i am not making an argument for or against attacks against israeli soldiers , another discussion . )"
"since i’m writing , i’ll mention the other issue - your use of the words “ cycle of violence ” is a second example , from a different posting ."
i believe we’d agree that both israel and the palestinian authority and community in general share responsibility for the difficulties between us .
but here i’ve given you a few issues to ponder and to respond to :-) .
i look forward to speaking or writing further with you on these and many other issues .
"today i went to work , and my boss responded to me ."
"then she was nice to me all day , but not to any of the other <UNK> that we could see ."
"i 'm very thankful for her treatment to me , but it bothers me that others were n't treated all that well ."
"well , i 'll just keep praying for the whole thing ."
earlier this week <#> of my uncles had a massive stroke .
the amazing thing is that now he 's up and walking with assistance !
plus he 's trying to talk and is looking a lot better than my mom thought that he would !
i ca n't go and visit him because of the distance and i ca n't get time off work because of our staff <UNK> .
"however , i 'll just keep praying for him and for my aunt ."
of course he could still have a stroke and stuff
"and things could happen , but , still , god is good and has touched him wonderfully !"
"hey ! just wanted to come and blow off some steam , i guess , although i do n't really know what exactly to say ."
"yes , i trust in god and know that he 's always there , and"
", yes , he does get us through , and not necessarily out of , tough situations ."
i work in <UNK> in a hotel and i do n't mind the work .
"if anyone has any good , constructive ideas on what to do , please let me know !"
i pray for her every day and it 's helped my attitude at least .
"sometimes i really notice an improvement in her , too , but it 's still hard ."
"see , my boss is hard to get along with ."
and she does n't even speak a single word to me .
not until i have to call down and tell her that <#> of my rooms is ready for the next guest .
"even then , she 's short with me and makes me feel small ."
i know it 's nothing that i 've done and i do n't take it
personally - usually - because she 's like this with everyone .
at other times she 's as bright as sunshine and nothing seems to get her done .
i 've talked to a few people about it .
"mostly , though , i pray about it and pray for her ."
i pray that my attitude will change and that i 'll keep working hard regardless of how she is .
"as i 've said , my attitude 's changed for the better ."
it does no good to go to the higher ups because they do nothing .
they know how she is with us in <UNK> .
"with others who work there , too , and even with some of the guests at times !"
"i do n't feel comfortable with telling a person off , anyway ."
"anyway , just had to vent , i guess ."
it was really hard <UNK> today and i 'm feeling a little better now that i 've spilled my guts .
"still , if anyone has any good , creative , constructive , positive ideas i 'd love to hear 'em ."
<UNK> so many different kinds for every mood and personality and taste .
god knew what he was doing when he created it !
"of course he did , though - he always knows what he 's doing ."
since the last days of july i 've been coming here to my church often to play the piano and to sing .
i 'm going to be helping with sunday evening services this fall and want to get into the spirit of it all .
"so i come and play , not having a piano of my own ."
i love the mental challenge of learning a new song .
i find it so <UNK> when i 've <UNK> that new mountain of notes !
"of course , if i know a song before i learn it on the piano it 's so much easier ."
"then i find , though , that i do n't always play according to the notes and the timing of the way it 's written ."
i 've found that i 've learned a lot of songs differently than how they 're actually written .
if i 'm playing on my own i can add my own little twist to things .
as long as the message and the basics of the song do n't change too much .
"these things all fade away , though , when i sing ."
"when i sat down at the piano this evening , it all lost its power to cause me distress ."
i was lost in the music and in the words and nothing mattered except singing to god .
"music 's always had that effect on me , even though i have n't always used it as therapy ."
"however , now that i 'm <UNK> it , i 'll not forget too quickly ."
there are a few songs i 've discovered in the past year that have really helped me .
"just the titles alone on some of them move me . """
"jesus , what a beautiful name . "" "" ancient words "" ( about the bible , which i love ) ."
my sis - in - law told me about this place .
"i think i 'd heard of it a while back , but never thought to try it out ."
"well , now , here i am , and blog i will !"
the <UNK> because that 's who i am .
""" <UNK> "" is my family nickname , and what children call me , and i live in the <UNK> , here in <UNK> , nt ."
"it 's not <UNK> <UNK> here and there are tons of trees , but it is still the <UNK> and well above the <UNK> circle ."
"i have lots of thoughts on many different things , all based on how my life has gone ."
for as long as i can remember i 've wanted to do what jesus wanted me to do .
"my mom taught me how to pray from a very early age , although i did n't always want to ."
"when i was <#> i "" asked jesus into my heart "" and have never <UNK> it ."
when i was in grade <#> i started asking the questions and eventually came to the conclusion that it had nothing to do with my parents .
it was between god and me and i <UNK> my life to serving him .
"this is quite a <UNK> version of the whole thing and i may talk about it more another time , but not today ."
i 'm definitely not saying that my life 's been a bed of roses since .
"oh , it 's not been too terrible , either , and it 's actually been very good for the most part ."
"still , god allows things to happen , and choices have been made ."
so now i 'm away from it and i feel wonderful !
<UNK> - that 's the theme i chose for my blog .
"to me , it was the best and was the <#> that <UNK> to me the most ."
that 's <#> reason i was totally thrilled to see that my current apartment face the east channel of the <UNK> river .
"then when i came here and saw the theme which i chose , i knew that was the <#> i wanted ."
"i love to go for walks by the river , or whatever water 's close at hand ."
"swimming 's always been <#> of my favourite things to do and have no fear of water , although i do have a healthy respect for it ."
"after all , it does n't pay to take unnecessary risks ."
"still , put me near water and i 'm happy ."
"there 's something even better than the water here on earth , though , and that 's the flood of the holy spirit over a person filled by him ."
that living water only found through jesus christ is truly something else !
it is in him i find my safe <UNK> where i can wait out any storm and be refreshed .
"<UNK> many times i 've turned to god , not knowing what else to do , and he 's always brought me through ."
jesus never promised us he would take us out of our troubles .
"rather , he promised us a way through them ."
"no , i do n't like going through trouble and i 'd avoid it if i could just as much as anyone else ."
"however , i 've learned a thing or <#> in my life , and <#> of them is that trouble helps form a person 's character ."
how you deal with it really shows who you are .
please turn to god and let him be your <UNK> .
i signed up for the <UNK> premium service getting high <UNK> - mid <#> down load times now and a <#> upload stream .
have not been online for the past week due to some systems know it all that came out on monday and messed this whole side of the <UNK> up ...
"<#> hours lost work and <#> "" forced visits "" from time <UNK> they still do n't know what is going on ."
can you believe that <#> of the <UNK> actually went out and kicked the cable box as part of the service ?
anyways will write more when i have the time and hopefully my internet will be up as well .
"well due to doing the ' home - owners ' stuff , and currently ripping my entire cd collection"
i have not had a chance to get into the gaming scene today .
second life : got plans for the second life club it is my goal to get from nothing to to top <#> % of the game .
it will be <UNK> with obstacles as i am totally <UNK> on other people .
but i do plan on learning how to script now ( great another something to add to my already over <UNK> list of things to do .
<UNK> : have not logged into it in over a month <UNK> !
"i canceled the <UNK> but was hit with a <#> month sub fee friday , made sure i canceled it now ...."
i m still <UNK> off from <UNK> into the middle of the bone knight room and losing all of my stuff .
but oh well you live and you learn :( doom <#> : got to get the soul cube got to do it .
i got the <UNK> today before i quit for the day .
"did nt get a chance to fire it off , not even a test fire round :( ..."

damn someone send me the winning lottery numbers quick ! ! ! ! !
i have been utterly hooked on doom <#> since thursday i have not even logged on to any other games .
i must admit in the beginning i was totally <UNK> in the game that when some of the demons presented themselves i kinda jumped .
well i have not been online very much since monday when some genius line tech came out and screwed this whole side of the <UNK> up .
so i 'm the bad son now that never goes and visits or never calls .
and they have come up a few times during those months .
true i do live <#> hours away and should make time
but i just do nt have it right now !
but yes i was an ass for not remembering my mother 's birthday that i ca n't excuse :( got
my brother phone mailed off finally via fed ex .
he 's been waiting on it for <#> months ....
ok maybe i do suck at time management ....
ok who ever said that <UNK> a home was better than a condo .... .... <UNK> damn i sound like i am angry all the time.. :(
but they have a <#> adult content <UNK> in their <UNK> meaning that someone could not post a picture of a night at <UNK> <UNK> .... .
but i really do nt have time to get a web site up and running atm .
anyone got any ideas for a good hosting site ?
"work is work nothing has changed i still hate it , but hey it pays the bills right ?"
"but that 's all for now , me this is my life as boring as it may be"
however with this many cd 's the dilemma is to fork out the $ <#> + to get the ipod that holds <UNK> of music .
"i could not tell the difference between the <#> settings using the computer , home stereo and headphones"
.... story of my life lol signing off for now !
edit : <UNK> <UNK> i m never going to get all this done .
"got the <UNK> cd ripping now , bbq started ( ribs and chicken ) , back yard not <UNK> , yard kids not here <UNK> , garage not cleaned ."
"oh i did do the swimming pool with out turning the water green , blue or red and no smoke either lol"
: <UNK> what a day been doing lots of stuff
but does not seem like i got anything accomplished at all .
hello world and welcome to my blog ( what a name huh ? ) .
in these pages i will without <UNK> post my day to day activities as well give you a glimpse into my past .
i will describe myself in my profile for the blog .
how often do we simply <UNK> the profound because it 's so <UNK> ordinary .
"truthfully , that 's what i love the most about god : the mechanical <UNK> of creation ."
"contrary to david <UNK> , what does god tell the sun each day ? "" rise , set ; do it again ; do it again ."
<UNK> <UNK> that part of god 's <UNK> is found in a little child 's ability to <UNK> in the <UNK> .
"somehow in the <UNK> of each day , i find myself increasingly out of touch with just how extraordinary the ordinary is ."
<#> of the reasons that i so <UNK> adore <UNK> <UNK> is his ability to make ordinary objects and colours <UNK> artistic and beautiful .
i sometimes wonder if god <UNK> to do the same in our own lives ?
"correct that , i do n't wonder - i know god does ."
which provides just the perfect analogy for what hurricane alex has just revealed about my own life .
"<UNK> <UNK> ; they deserved <UNK> , he <UNK> ."
"perhaps he was right , but god had other plans ."
sitting at my computer early this morning i found myself <UNK> by the <UNK> of having a hurricane named after myself on the exact same week of my birthday .
perhaps it 's just chance ; perhaps it 's <UNK> .
"i do n't know , but i could n't help but find myself thinking like a hurricane ."
"<UNK> the human toll of destruction , what purpose does a hurricane serve that never comes in land ?"
so the question returns full circle yet again : beauty or <UNK> ? <UNK> or <UNK> ?
"may god pursue us as <UNK> as god did <UNK> , until we find ourselves thinking like a hurricane ."
it ’s been a <UNK> dream of mine for quite some time .
many rooms and i <UNK> from room to room looking at everything in it with wonder .
these rooms are new to me and i am delighted when i discover a new <#> .
"okay not bad , now this dream is getting good ."
he seems to be barking orders here and there and starts telling me i need to go look for more rooms .
all of a sudden my family at the curb - side and i hear him say “ bus driver … hit it ” .
"they’re coming to my house , i know they are !"
so today victor takes me to the <UNK> place at our local hospital to get me a new <UNK> to wear for when my hair falls out .
i had spotted that <UNK> months ago on my numerous trips past the store .
all went well and we bought the <UNK> .
i brought it home and the children were curious .
<UNK> : what 's that hair in there for ?
"<UNK> : no it 's not , it 's hair !"
i then put the <UNK> on so the kids could see it .
"<UNK> , my <#> year old , never <UNK> to <UNK> me with her humor ."
<UNK> : i want to go outside now !
"me : you ca n't <UNK> , <UNK> is out there ."
<UNK> makes her way to the sliding glass doors <UNK> : there 's not anyone out the window .
me : that 's <UNK> i get a very mixed up look from a <#> year old .
"noah , my <#> year old , is a very thoughtful and <UNK> boy ."
: i have a brother me : what 's his name ?
noah : no he 's just there for a check up me :
oh and do i have to feed this brother of yours too ?
": in my bed , that 's why i have the white pillow ."
"me : oh good , because i do n't think i could fit another bed in your room ."
yet another child i sent away with the look of total confusion .
"sometimes , it 's fun to mess with your kids ' heads ."
it 's funny how the mind works with the body .
it has never <UNK> to <UNK> me what i have been able to do with my mind since i was about <#> .
i think i was walking home close to christmas holidays and i knew i was in trouble for something .
so much so that my temp went up to <#> and i have xmas pictures to prove how sick i truly became .
why does the mind have so much power over the body .
get some good anti - <UNK> meds put in me and then start with <UNK> . then comes the first drug .
"the nurse said to me "" knowing you , you 'll be calling it the red devil "" ."
i could n't look at it going in . that was followed by the second <UNK> drug and then the rest of the <UNK> .
i wake up a little hungry and start to eat .
i <UNK> and did n't want to over do it .
"a half an hour later , <UNK> <#> meds ..."
"was i <UNK> thinking about the word "" poison "" as i had referred to my <UNK> before hand ?"
what does our body do to rid itself of poison ?
i 've always been in tune with my body .
i now listen to every signal i get no matter how small .
"a lesson , listen to your body and do n't think yourself paranoid because the mind can do some weird stuff sometimes ."
have you ever looked back on your life and could pin point something that changed your life forever .
i 'm not talking about positive life changes like the baby you have <#> months to prepare for or marrying your true love .
i 'm sitting here the day before my first <UNK> treatment .
i thought i would be okay with it all .
"afterall , together victor and i chose this course of treatment for my breast cancer ."
we wanted to kick it in the balls and not give it a chance to come back .
so why am i sitting here freaked out by the thought of losing my hair ?
it 's only going to be gone for <#> months or so .
it 's not like it 's going to be gone for ever .
yet here i sit scared out of my <UNK> .
i guess it 's because i 'm not prepared .
"i only have <#> or <#> <UNK> , my survivor <UNK> and a hat or <#> ."
this was going to suffice as i was sure i 'd be okay with just covering up my head .
what is the first thing i think of when i see a bald lady covering up her head with a hat or scarf .
i do n't want people to look at me and think that .
another factor that scares me about <UNK> is the effects the <UNK> have on my body .
"no more <UNK> cycle , <UNK> of <UNK> , oh joy hot flashes that i ca n't take <UNK> to counter ."
what will i be able to retain once i start <UNK> ?
<#> . savings fathers ' life x <#> times at <#> am in the morning over <#> months
quite proud of parents ' passion afterwards considering their age and physical condition .
mother approached to explain why she has never <UNK> to me in whole life .
"answer ( to be expected ) "" because i am always right . """
<#> . doctors get hold of lover 's father and operate endlessly for no ( all intense and ) purpose other than to <UNK> misery on sweet man .
own father not breathing so well and smoking like <UNK> <#> .
water and lights not cut off god knows why .
she had a great life but the sadness is deep sad .
great friend musician 's wife leaves for an other country .
child requires promised most expensive addictive toy and no way of backing out without appearing completely <UNK> so buy on tick and get black mark .
immediate work superior <UNK> like most important bully on block on daily basis .
she does not have a <UNK> but you can only tell by looking at her .
nobody cares so new puppy constantly gets out and races cars along main road .
thank god our vet is <UNK> <UNK> of childhood sweetheart so at least get to flirt in the midst of <UNK> .
so have to fix or get <UNK> at front door .
"week later , wake up at <#> am to see <#> men at bottom gate ( open ) in dark , talking ."
think it 's our friends - the guys who live at bottom of our garden in the new improved south africa so wave and go back to sleep .
in daylight it becomes obvious gate motor has been stolen by <UNK> <UNK> .
why did n't we do that in first place ?
"next : week later , big truck arrives to fetch <UNK> and <UNK> out of gate straight into <UNK> system ."
son sings <UNK> costs you not a thing and he who is happy is a king .
"only phone is still cut off so if you do n't have cell no , you have to leave ."
i went to visit my <UNK> and she asked me how 's it going .
"i said "" <UNK> i am praying for the <UNK> "" ."
she said i should start by putting out that cigarette .
"i love <UNK> <UNK> - "" love is short , forgetting is long "" ."
you can imagine i 'm not to happy about that .
so if you 're interested by all means leave a comment for me and/or email me at <UNK>
well after that amazingly <UNK> day i could really use a hug ... come to think of it
maybe they would n't have been such <UNK> !
"you know , i once read that to be a truly happy person you need to have <#> hugs a day ... <#> !"
"how many of us get even half that much , honestly ?"
no wonder we 're a miserable bunch of <UNK> eh ?
maybe doctors should stop <UNK> <UNK> and start <UNK> hugs ...
"maybe the <UNK> could save some funds if they had a staff of ' hug volunteers ' in fact , i think we could start a medical revolution ."
it 's not just that i 've only just caught my breath after a ( hopeful ) <#> days off of work .
it 's not just because i 'm tired and after having <#> days of freedom finally realise just how crap being a wage slave really it ...
"right away , on the dot regardless of what it is , who they are or however <UNK> they may be ."
"honestly , do n't these people have better things to do all weekend then <UNK> about minor problems until they make them <UNK> in their <UNK> little minds ?"
i know i 'm not the only <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> rep right ... more like <UNK> <UNK> ! ) that feels this way ... what happened to manners
", what happened to logical thought processes ... what happened to intelligence in general ?"
i 'm told i have a very soothing voice and manner about me .
"for the precious few that do treat me <UNK> i always do bend over backward to help , even if it hurts my performance levels . but"
do n't these people realise that you catch more flies with honey than <UNK> ?
"i know it 's unlikely to change which is most unfortunate , but i ca n't vent my <UNK> to them so i 'm doing it here ..."
some people just have nothing better to do with their time eh ?
"oh well , tis mostly just a place for me to blow off steam and to piss around on at work when i should be doing something more constructive ..."
if it <UNK> you in the meantime then <UNK> for me and hey maybe i 'll get some good karma bonus points or something !
placing the star in just the right spot was a bit tricky but well worth it for the effect .
"the weather was just great , right around <#> in the day and right around <#> - <#> during the evening and night time ."
"<UNK> , we had an elephant ear for you and some corn on the <UNK> , thank you bob ."
"we did n't run into as many people as we usually do , i do n't understand ."
"oh well , in a small town we see them all the time anyway ."
"hope <#> year you can come back and enjoy the sights , sounds and smell of all the food with us ."
( if we could get them off the rides ! )
"of course , putting on makeup in order to feel great is superficial ."
i do n't care who looks hideous on the covers of which magazines .
i do n't care who is the latest and the greatest .
i do n't care about the art directors that <UNK> in passing the buck .
i do n't care about the <UNK> that have the best equipment .
"i 'm horrible at pretending to care , so i should just move on ."
"by the way , urllink paris hilton makes my left eye <UNK> , even though i just do n't care ."
"i found this card created by <UNK> <UNK> , a german <UNK> , in an <UNK> card shop today ."
it does n't seem like a vision of the past .
i 've been feeling very domestic these past few months .
items made from scratch : blue berry pie and a rub for the ribs ( my sister loved that ) .
"people to enjoy : scott , jason , and urllink dee ."
"here is something i was asked to do , but"
wasn’t allowed to post it because it had to be at most <#> characters ... random demand : the children are waiting !
"when no trucks appeared , he noticed a dead squirrel in the middle of the road ."
"some flies were <UNK> around , so he ate them all ."
"the next day , he was hungry again , so he hopped over to the dead squirrel , but no flies were around ."
he decided to put on the dead squirrel and hop around in order to attract flies .
he looked kinda like <UNK> green man with a <UNK> on .
"a young lady noticed him and stopped to pick him up . """
why do n't you come with me and i 'll clean you up .
""" the frog thought ( why not ? ) , and went with the young lady ."
"it was near night fall , so the frog had the desire to sing ."
"the young lady said , "" my , you are very talented ."
i know this producer that could get you a job as a singer !
""" the frog thought ( why not ? ) and sang the next day for the producer ."
"the producer liked him so much , that he made him the latest pop star ."
all the boys and girls bought all of his t - shirts and hit singles making him millions .
his now dry - cleaned dead squirrel was no longer smelly enough to attract the kinds of flies he wanted .
he was just constantly surrounded by pop star <UNK> .
so the frog decided to take the dead squirrel off of his head and put on a freshly killed dead <UNK> .
nobody liked his new look and he became very smelly .
all the pop star <UNK> started talking about how odd he became and stopped buying his records .
"homeless again , he just <UNK> and went back towards his dried up pond with the dead <UNK> on his head ."
this time there were tons of flies <UNK> around for him to eat .
he was n't bored anymore and his singing attracted other <UNK> with which he could share his flies .
""" good thing about <UNK> is ... never mind ... <UNK> ... good thing about <UNK> is ..."
you never have to worry about making a mistake ... and you never have to worry about being too corporate .
source : urllink tim <UNK> at urllink <UNK> .
"now i am a mass producer of crap . """
"source : assistant creative director of a new york <UNK> company which shall remain anonymous , unfortunately ."
being locked up in a studio all day seems to put time into <UNK> .
"i just realized today that the sun is going down earlier , reminding me that it is nearly time for a change of season ..."
"i thought i could sneak across to get to the subway right around the corner , but the police ran at me yelling , "" hey you !"
the police were very hyper and would not answer questions from anyone .
we white - <UNK> the trip under the river and to our <UNK> into manhattan .
the restaurant industry has n't changed much at all over the past few years .
"the constant little <UNK> among the staff , the complaining about this or that"
; it was weird when it hit me because i had kind of <UNK> it the way that you do after times passes .
"i was remembering the team work , the food and the <UNK> during the days between when i got hired and the day i started ."
"now , this week i have been reminded of the smoking and drinking , the whole mentality of the industry is just different and weird ."
"i think i have said this in the past , it is a great job for a young person in school ."
i think that is the part that is hardest for me .
i have changed so much that i do n't fit anymore .
"anyway , so here 's the update on my job hunt ."
there are <#> main things that i am looking at right now .
"actually , let 's start with a little warning ."
this job hunting thing is a <UNK> pain in the butt .
i tend to not want to talk to anyone because it feeds my excitement and then i feel awful when it does n't work out .
i 've given this some thought and i think it has a lot to do with feeling rejected and not dealing with that well .
"so , i am trying to get over that ."
here are my <#> latest leaders : <#> is a publishing company located in <UNK> .
they 've been around for a while and are primarily the spiritual genre .
i got the impression from the ad that i found for an associate editor position that their book division was up and running .
"i wrote a truly inspired cover letter , and sent it to the hr person and lo and behold , i got a response ."
"this job actually came up in a funny way , a random friend of a friend mentioned it and then was rather <UNK> towards both parties that we meet ."
"he was dead - on , though because when we met , we totally hit it off ."
"however , we have run into a few <UNK> , also ."
apparently they have never hired a <UNK> for the original position that we discussed and hr is <UNK> a bit about it .
"and , the original position was located in california , however , according to the website yesterday , there was a sales position here ."
"i have been in constant communication with both the person who i 've already met and her hiring manager , so we 'll see where that goes ."
"urllink summer <#> , pretty much what i look like now , too ."
"<#> ) you do know me , right ? and"
<#> ) this is a great idea and everyone should do it .
how cool to have a place were you can put pictures and let people know what is going on with your life ?
"plus , you can always go back and <UNK> things you may have forgotten ("
how much better is that than having to pretend you were paying attention when you were n't ? )
my <UNK> daughter left today to spend the summer with relatives .
"do n't get me wrong , i love her dearly , but the last few months have been * challenging * , to say the least ."
i hope she 'll have a lot of fun .
"that said , i 've got more than enough to keep me busy while she 's away ."
it 's time to start <UNK> away at my ever - growing <UNK> .
"after all , i need to make room for some new yarn , right ?"
"today i start on my summer <UNK> , another <UNK> from my favorite <UNK> ."
"well , maybe it 's not quite an "" original "" ."
"she wore it with blue jeans , a white tee and some very sexy - looking high - <UNK> slides ."
she had purchased it from a trendy shop in the city and was wondering if someone could help her figure out how to make another <#> for herself .
i 'm using <UNK> 's <UNK> in a beautiful deep mustard color .
"since i intend to do nothing else today except knit , i should get quite a bit done ."
"here it is , the <#> i 've been waiting to wear ... my <UNK> sweater ."
the pattern is a lettuce knit original ( my favorite <UNK> - local yarn shop ) .
"i was about <#> "" from the end when i noticed that a join had come undone ."
i had to <UNK> the entire sweater and start again .
the good news is that i love this <#> so much that i 'm going to make another <#> in black !
"here 's sa picture of <#> of my <UNK> possessions ... <UNK> knitting needles from my husband , jonathan ."
"most people would make needles from wooden <UNK> , but not my <UNK> ."
"he started with a <UNK> of <UNK> , which he cut into <#> "" strips "" ."
"hours of <UNK> ( by hand ) later , those strips were transformed !"
now i 'm on a mission to find the perfect project with which to <UNK> my new needles .
"i 've tried <UNK> before , but never had much luck with it ."
"and many times , i just did n't * feel * like writing ."
"at <#> , i 've finally found a passion in life , in a most unexpected format - knitting ."
it 's become so much more than a <UNK> or a hobby .
", i create things that please my eyes , <UNK> my skin , and massage my ego - all at the same time ."
it 's about creating a vision and making it happen ...
it 's about understanding that giving a gift can be as great a joy as receiving <#> ...
it 's about practicing the principles of <UNK> abundance ...
it 's about realizing the <UNK> mystery of creating a piece of <UNK> art from a single piece of string .
i thought that subject line would get your attention ! ;)
"i 'm talking about that dreaded "" s "" word ... <UNK> !"
i understand the need for <UNK> to measure the stitch <UNK> before starting on a new project .
"who care how many rows that is , right ? not ! ! !"
i found a wonderful pattern with <UNK> sleeves that extend all the way to the <UNK> .
v sweater urllink i did a <UNK> and the stitch <UNK> was fine .
"of course , this meant going to my <UNK> <UNK> to sit and knit ."
"i took a couple of projects , <#> of which just needed the dreaded finishing that i 've been putting of for weeks ."
"not only did i get the cable shell finished , but i learned a beautiful finishing technique in the process ."
cable shell urllink i made some progress on the <UNK> shell also .
i ca n't seem to bring myself to spend a lot of time on the <UNK> summer <UNK> .
"i know it 's going to look great when i finish it , but i 'm just not "" feeling it "" right now ."
"i 'm about a third of the way done , so i 've convinced myself that i 'll have it done in time for cooler weather in the fall ."
"we took a short break for lunch , and then returned for an afternoon of knitting ."
"the sudan has been rocked by bloody civil wars for most of it 's history , at least dating to it 's independence in <#> ."
"the present conflict in the sudan is the longest running conflict in the world , an ongoing <UNK> disaster that has progressed <UNK> for about <#> years ."
so why the sudden interest in the sudan ?
i 'm beginning to suspect that sudan has been on the back burner for quite a while .
"judging by urllink this article in may , <#> , i believe it was approaching the front burner , until events led us off in a different direction ."
would it be too cynical of me to suggest that we had bigger <UNK> to <UNK> ?
"in the meantime , the us has at <UNK> times played both good cop and bad cop in it 's dealing 's with the sudan ."
"from <UNK> <UNK> , to lifting <UNK> , to creating <UNK> in the <UNK> , etc ."
"interestingly , late june is about the time the us handed over <UNK> of iraq ."
the sudan is probably not at the <UNK> of most people 's minds .
here 's your long - shot for the october surprise .
"the overwhelming support for this "" <UNK> cause "" , both here and abroad , <UNK> the memories of iraq and <UNK> bush to re - election ."
will be back later with some <UNK> thoughts on the sudan .
i think it is a very good read about the influence of money on politics .
"urllink <UNK> of course , we can write all the articles we want , and nothing will change ."
"it 's leaders <UNK> to the <UNK> , and to force the complete removal of corporate money from the political process ."
"up to now , it seems the american people have more important things on their minds than democracy ."
"even when things look their <UNK> , it is instinct to hope for better ."
"what if what we believed in so dearly , in this case democracy , turned out to be nothing more than an elaborate <UNK> ?"
"most , i believe , are naturally unwilling to let go of their grip on hope ."
it is just as <UNK> to let go of your belief in a system or way of life .
it is easier to live the <UNK> of the lie than to face the <UNK> of reality .
with the lie you have something to believe in .
"and with the lie , you continue to feed the machine ."
just because they tell you that you have democracy does not make it so .
simply putting <#> names on a ballot does not give you a choice .
"if both names answer to the same master , was there really a choice ?"
"if you have not read george <UNK> 's <#> , please do ."
"this should not come as a surprise , if you follow the mad ramblings of the <UNK> over at <UNK> ."
) there was never the intention to have an exit strategy .
"instead , there was meant to be a military force in the region in <UNK> ."
so where is his strategy any different than that of the the <UNK> ?
"it 's really an amazing feat of <UNK> , and both the <UNK> and the <UNK> have"
"and i am sure that even that <UNK> will change to "" the <UNK> future "" ."
"while they do a great little dance with the <UNK> we call democracy , the <UNK> of their plans aside , the results will be the same ."
"<UNK> , there are just too many good reasons to stay ."
"all those <UNK> contracts , not to mention the oil , and the chance to <UNK> and threaten other would be <UNK> in the neighborhood ."
here 's the link to kerry 's <UNK> on the issue - urllink <UNK> -
urllink <UNK> and how far over the edge does a government have to go to get the following quote out of pat <UNK> ?
"( if the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starts <UNK> , i 'll take that as <#> of the signs of the <UNK> . )"
what is so <UNK> is the <UNK> at which the authorities are now going .
"it is <#> thing to ignore <UNK> , or to <UNK> <UNK> ."
it is another thing altogether when the authorities will use <UNK> measures to <UNK> out <UNK> altogether .
"open debate is no longer <UNK> , and attempts at starting a dialogue are met with reactions such as "" go fuck yourself "" ."
"but of course , the royal court demands an apology when someone <UNK> <UNK> in their direction , as well <UNK> as it might be ."
do you really think either <UNK> has your interests at heart ?
for too long i ignored the truth about the political process in this country . but
events of the last <#> years have permanently altered my perception .
"but much more than my perception changing , my voice has changed ."
and it 's so easy to see the <UNK> written into the first amendment .
my guess is it took the ministry of truth about <#> seconds to re - write that amendment .
could you have imagined our history for the last <#> years if king george had just implemented free speech <UNK> ?
it certainly would have avoided that ugly boston tea party scene .
"for democracy is a beautiful thing , but like any other form of government , it is easily <UNK> and <UNK> by the wealthy and powerful ."
"certainly i will be labeled as <UNK> , <UNK> , an <UNK> , etc ."
"because i will not believe the spin doctors and the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> , i will be , in thier eyes , committing thought crime ."
"i will not let lies and <UNK> continue to go <UNK> , and <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
the way this whole swift boat issue has taken legs as a campaign issue is rather disgusting .
"but rather than getting into the debate over a meaningless issue , i want to look at the root causes and effects of dirty politics ."
"for those looking for an in - depth look at the swift boat issue , urllink here is a link ."
it is said that money is the root of all evil .
you need no better example of this than the effect that money has on politics .
the amount of money <UNK> to campaigns by the middle class worker is basically <UNK> .
let 's look specifically at the top <UNK> to this years presidential candidates .
"using the latest figures from urllink <UNK> , we find that <#> companies show up in the top <#> list of <UNK> for both candidates ."
"the <#> companies which have <UNK> heavily to both candidates are : morgan stanley , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , bank of america , and microsoft ."
"now , of these <#> companies who are <UNK> heavily to both candidates , how many do you think have your best interests at heart ?"
"if you were to break down each candidate by the amount of money <UNK> by industry , you get some interesting <UNK> ."
"lawyers and law <UNK> are the leading industry <UNK> to kerry , the second leading industry <UNK> to bush ."
"<UNK> companies are the 4th leading <UNK> industry to kerry , the 4th leading <UNK> industry to bush as well ."
"health professionals ( doctors and their organizations ) are the 6th leading industry <UNK> to kerry , the 6th leading industry <UNK> to bush ."
"<UNK> financial companies are the 7th leading <UNK> by industry to bush , the 13th leading <UNK> by industry to kerry ."
"commercial banks are the 16th leading <UNK> by industry to kerry , the 10th leading <UNK> by industry to bush ."
"again , how many of these <UNK> do you think are looking out for your interests ?"
the <UNK> do not have the best interests of the people at heart .
democracy at this point is nothing more than a <UNK> .
and this process is repeated over and over at every level .
"issues that mean nothing , mud <UNK> , name calling , <UNK> ."
<UNK> politics meant to divide the people and <UNK> their attention from the man behind the curtain .
"wake up <UNK> , your not in america anymore ."
"the word <UNK> is from the greek for "" few "" and "" rule "" ."
many political <UNK> have argued that all societies are inevitably <UNK> no matter the supposed political system . )
"<UNK> jones ' former lawyer , <UNK> , writer , author , and <UNK> ."
"to the enlightened , she is merely a <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> ."
it might be easy to <UNK> her rants as the <UNK> of intellectual <UNK> meets <UNK> .
"unfortunately , to the more easily fooled <UNK> <UNK> , she is a <UNK> - goddess , and her <UNK> filled <UNK> are gospel . and"
how anyone can take ann <UNK> seriously is probably more a question for the <UNK> community than for <UNK> .
but the fact that a small extremely radical <UNK> does take her seriously is not the most <UNK> thing .
more <UNK> is that she is given the venue to spill her <UNK> <UNK> .
"but no <#> has ever accused the the fox neo - con channel of common <UNK> , nor <UNK> reporting for that matter ."
ann has <UNK> forth racial hate on a daily basis for the better part of her public life .
""" we should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to christianity . """
many others have lost their jobs in the media for much less .
"when it comes to <UNK> <UNK> and what most non - <UNK> normally refer to as reality , ann makes no attempt to approach either ."
"but in ann 's world , ahh , all is bliss as long as she can continue to <UNK> <UNK> to justify killing anyone that is not white ."
ann 's blatant hatred <UNK> to anyone whom does not share her extreme radical ideology .
"then again , ann is not actually inviting anyone her to debate her ."
"a lawyer by training , she knows that if she can just plant her lies with the jury often enough , the lie soon becomes perceived as fact ."
most in the political arena have <UNK> this art to <#> degree or another .
ann has become a darling of the corporate media .
she has free reign to spill her <UNK> onto the <UNK> public .
she is undoubtedly the most <UNK> personality to be involved in political commentary in this country . and
someone so <UNK> is actually what the corporate media needs as they march forward with their agenda to <UNK> democracy .
"the more divided the american people , the better it is for the corporate media , and ultimately , those pulling the strings of the corporate media ."
it does n't matter if you love ann or <UNK> ann .
"as long as ann <UNK> , she serves her purpose ."
well i figured a <UNK> blog would be fun .
not sure how long this will go on for .
so i 've lived here in the us for about <#> years now .
"they have a wide selection of <UNK> , but here comes my rant ."
"ok i 'm cool with a few from each state , some french , australian etc ."
"in contrast i found about <#> <UNK> and only a couple of other italian <UNK> , even fewer german ones ."
being from britain i was <UNK> by the choice at us <UNK> when i moved here .
millions of choices of milk and orange juice .
maybe it 's a subtle way of putting france out of business ?
seal beach ca i lived in seal beach for about <#> years and had a great time out there .
then things began to change ( as they always do ) .
"<UNK> closed ( what a wild night that was ) and re - opened as <UNK> - different atmosphere , but still pretty good ."
a new <UNK> opened across - but it was n't the same .
"charlotte nc did n't find many places in charlotte to hang out on account of the fact that you really have to drive everywhere , <#> exception was <UNK> !"
<UNK> <UNK> mar ca the great <UNK> of round here was without a doubt <UNK> ( pronounced <UNK> ) !
"shame when they stopped <UNK> on the <UNK> , but oh those <UNK> were to die for :-)"
"so we come to <UNK> , not really been too many places but have found a great place ."
the <UNK> is awesome - <UNK> on <UNK> and also the best ( mild ) <UNK> i 've tasted in the us .
so i 'm trying to figure out what i 'd like to do for my big <#> oh .
"we were thinking of going back to the "" old country "" but some things are happening to friends and they would not be around ."
"would have been good to see <UNK> green , but it 'll have to wait ."
next thought was let 's do something cool like a cruise .
"we went on <#> last year and it was awesome , free food and got to see lots of mexico ."
not a good idea in sept - see <UNK> :-)
"then i looked at <UNK> and found tons of cool package deals , some of which made me think of going to britain again ."
finally we 've settled on <UNK> beach south carolina .
not exactly exciting ; unlike my 30th birthday when i <UNK> round <UNK> in italy .
maybe i should start planning for my <UNK> now :-)
i suppose i should get this stuff off my chest .
why is bush even in with a chance of winning ?
seems like everyone has missed the lessons on <UNK> who serve in the administration .
i know it 's difficult to admit mistakes but when you are responsible for something and there is a problem you should admit it 's your problem .
example <#> - who was in charge of the security for the us on sept 11th ?
seems like it was that other guy 's fault .
no <#> in the administration wants to admit it was their fault .
is n't bush the commander - in - chief ?
"he was very happy to land in a big <UNK> in san diego when "" mission accomplished "" in iraq ."
so why not admit that he was sorry about the sept 11th attacks .
i 'm not asking for him to <UNK> ; just admit he was in charge on that day ( ? ? ? ? ? ) and
that since he 's in charge it 's basically up to him ....
in world war <#> people <UNK> thier <UNK> during the war - not get needless tax cuts !
example <#> - who was in charge when the us declared war on iraq ?
"oh sorry there do n't seem to be any "" ."
i was drawn back to some comments clinton made a while back on <#> minutes over here in the us .
"he said he wanted to take out <UNK> bin laden , but the intelligence was not certain ."
"seems to me like clinton used his head a little , rather than bush and his determination to <UNK> his position in the us and created a fake war ."
ok political rant over .... thanks for your time :-)
just got a <UNK> ( a dell <#> ) and a <UNK> <UNK> .
i travel a lot and it helps me find places lots and lots .
also when you get lost - it re - <UNK> the route for you - kewl
so why are people making a bid deal out of this .
seems like a simple apology would have <UNK> rather than <#> mins on all news stations and john edwards having to go back there .
he was n't driving the train ! looking on the bright side ...
i did n't get bitten by any of my little friends in the south today .
this will be an ongoing theme since the little <UNK> seem to like eating foreign food ( i.e. british ) .
"well , i have decided to "" raise the bar "" on my fitness and health ."
"after a few days of convincing by my friend and fitness <UNK> tony gray , i am entering a mini <UNK> ."
it is <UNK> held in the month of march or april so i have some time to start training for it .
"no , i 'm not ready , <UNK> or physically ."
i am completly scared to death of it ... and thus is the very reason i have to do it !
"urllink and here is the "" holy crap !"
how did i ever let myself look like this ? ?
"urllink so this is about <#> months into the whole "" i do n't eat crap "" anymore process ."
i still have a long way to go towards my <#> year goal of being more fit than i was in my <#> 's however
", i think i am off to a good start on a permanent lifestyle change ."
"i guess i was like <#> % of the public , excited that i could eat all the bacon i ever wanted and still lose fat ."
it 's not like that at all when you choose to low carb .
"really , i mean , what have you been told by big <UNK> for the last <#> years ?"
"i here things like , "" wow i could never do that etc etc ."
i invite you to take a deeper look into what low carb is ... and not what other people think .
urllink this is the company i work for as the special projects director .
we work hard as well as play hard !
currently we have <#> locations <UNK> with a 5th location is in the works later this year !
we are on our way to our main goal of <#> health clubs in <#> years !
the major crisis i have right now is that age old <UNK> do you want to do with your life ? ?
"if i had the answer for that , then i am more than sure a cure for cancer would soon follow ."
not sure if i am proud of that fact or not ?
"i 'm currently on career number <#> , though i do n't think i ever really used my first degree the way it was intended ."
"my dream was to work as a <UNK> for the fbi , so i got a degree in psychology and <UNK> ( for the criminal classes ) ."
"graduated with that in <#> , but the only way to really get to the fbi at that point was joining the police force and earning my way there ."
"i really liked that , so i started back to school to become a <UNK> teacher ."
"that did n't really pay the bills , so i went into being an insurance agent ( let 's just say that lasted about a year ) ."
from there i went to work for a friend of the ex 's family and then finally decided i really wanted to go back to school for computers .
"so the summer of <#> , i headed back to school and started working toward another bachelor 's this time in <UNK> ( computer management and information systems ) ."
"i landed a co - op position to gain some experience and worked there for about a year , before i had to seek full - time employment ."
"that was <#> and i was lucky enough to have several job offers and picked on at a "" not for profit "" organization ."
i only left because they were <UNK> out of the area .
so i started working here on the help desk and have been here since .
"but , i 'm really having trouble seeing myself <UNK> people 's forgotten <UNK> at age <#> or <#> ."
"so , i 'm in search of a new career ."
i would love to be giving <UNK> to pregnant mom 's to be .
"of course , i should know plenty about <UNK> , i 've had tons of them done over the <UNK> of my many medical problems ."
went to rush <UNK> er on friday at <#> pm .
was <UNK> with a <UNK> strain and was given off of work till <#> .
"also , saturday <#> hours ot was available and <#> hours double time ( plus holiday pay , <UNK> ) on monday ."
"due to accident , i can’t do any of it ."
thursday ( <#> ) i was in a car accident .
"a car turned infront of me , crossing my lane to enter a strip mall on north <UNK> <UNK> about <#> yards east of the intersection at <UNK> ."
the traffic light was out and the traffic to turn left ( <UNK> <UNK> ) was backed up almost <#> yards .
"has <#> lanes heading in each direction and where this other car came from , was a left turn lane from the opposite direction ."
my ( right ) lane was clear to the <UNK> .
"the speed limit there is <#> , but i was already <UNK> down , between <#> - <#> ."
"i hit the brakes and tried to turn to miss her , after hitting her"
"when i hit her , i tore off the entire front end of her car ."
she was n't hurt ; i did jerk hard and hit my head .
i went to enterprise to get a rental after the jeep went to the body shop .
"state farm said that even though it was her fault , they couldn’t pay till they got a hold of her ."
enterprise took $ <#> from my <UNK> ( actually only the <UNK> from the <UNK> company for the $ <#> for deposit if needed ) .
"after taking care of business , i went back to enterprise and they gave me the <#> <UNK> they just got back in ."
<#> called my regular doctor ; he was booked so they got me in with dr .
"she wrote me off work , <#> <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> ( <UNK> generic ) and <UNK> ( <UNK> ) ."
<#> state farm finally called and said they got a hold of her and that everything would be <#> % paid .
my insurance office called the next day to say the same thing .
<#> started therapy at <UNK> twice a week .
"also went back to doc , put me off till the 11th ."
wrote to return to work on <#> on <UNK> that <UNK> sent .
<#> the body shop called and said the <UNK> were being started .
"<#> talked to leslie ( works contact from home office ) , agreed to go back on the 14th as original written by doc ."
<UNK> did send the <UNK> medical info to leslie but had a return to the dr on the 14th and work on the 15th .
i told leslie i feel good enough to get back on the 14th and she agreed it was ok since i have the info doc originally wrote .
"<#> tried calling leslie in <UNK> to going back to work today , she is out of the office till july 6th ."
called <UNK> ( facility nurse ) at work and the only info that she received was the return to doc today and work tomorrow the 15th .
<UNK> also gave me phone # for john <UNK> ( the company <UNK> ) .
"dr . <UNK> ’s office called back said if i felt good enough , no need for <UNK> today and i could return on the 15th with no restrictions ."
i also asked the dr ’s office to <UNK> that info to <UNK> .
"i called the body shop , they said they were waiting on parts , paint is done ."
don hoped to send it out to get the <UNK> done on friday .
i haven’t heard anything from the state farm since <#> .
<#> returned to work for <UNK> <#> hours .
was in some pain but thought it was <UNK> .
"did have <#> hours physical therapy before work , everything felt ok ."
"while at work , wes talked to be about a safety violation of mine on the 26th of may ."
he told me that the <UNK> team decided that he should just talk to me about it and make sure i knew it was wrong .
i thanked him and apologized for my actions .
"went to work , left after <#> hour , pain was increasing ."
she filled out med info sheet for <UNK> <UNK> me to <#> hours .
"<#> when i got to work , <UNK> said she ( as in <UNK> ) needed in print from doctor ’s office "" only <#> hours per day "" ."
"while at <UNK> , agreed to <#> times a week for therapy ."
"<#> called doctor ’s office and asked for something from the office , from the doctor to be <UNK> to <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is off till monday , they said they would ask dr ."
saturday was scheduled ; i lost another <#> ot .
"<#> had therapy in the morning , but once at work , i was hurting the first hour ."
i talked to wes at <UNK> telling him i needed to leave due to the pain .
"he suggested that if i need the cold packs to work , maybe i should be off work ."
"with suggestions like that , the ass should become a doctor !"
"called the body shop , they believed they would have it ready today ."
<#> gonna swing by body shop to check on truck .
need to ask for some <UNK> from doc on wednesday .
need to go back for a couple of problems .
no new drugs ; she did send me to hospital for more x - rays and to take some labs at the office too .
<UNK> also wants me to return next week to <UNK> ; thinking his <UNK> may be of help with this .
after work i went to the rush for the x - rays .
i called <UNK> ’s nurse and asked if there was anything i could do for the pain .
work had to force ot for thursday and friday ; i would have had to work <#> hours ot each day .
"<#> went to therapy at 10:30 , maria really worked on the right side of my back good ."
left therapy at noon so i could drive to <UNK> to get my script for the medication .
"after i got it , i dropped it off at <UNK> to pick it up after work ."
"work was rough , but i did get thru <#> hours , first time this week ."
"<#> woke up in a lot of pain . took <#> <UNK> at <#> am ,"
<#> pm i could still feel its <UNK> helpful .
"back does hurt a lot , work is gonna suck ."
"they announced that saturday would be scheduled , could even work more than <#> hours ."
"i keep losing ot and since i can’t work , when i do get back to full duty , i will be on the bottom of the ot list ."
"called the body shop , gonna go in on monday to get center cap fixed ."
i also asked them about the bug <UNK> .
"morning is still <UNK> to get moving , more so than normal ."
"the <UNK> ( <UNK> ) helps , but it only lasts soo long ."
"i still will only take <#> at a time , i am afraid of how <#> will make me feel ."
later in the evening i took <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time .
i feel a <UNK> in the wheel that i can’t identify .
gonna go by brian ’s ( hope he is back from vacation ) before i go back to cars on monday .
"<#> pain wakes me early , too hard to sleep during that day ."
"every night , after sleeping , i wake up sweating ; some times on the couch , others in bed and the <UNK> is on , set at <#> ."
he said that we needed to talk about my safety violation ( from may 26th ) .
"he also made remarks saying that the <UNK> was a result of my not remembering my "" violation "" ."
"he then said that because of my accident it must be due to "" post <UNK> stress disorder "" ."
when the fuck did he become a doctor .
called and left message for <UNK> ’s service as needing someone to talk to .
"because of that statement , they wanted the <UNK> to fit the action ."
<#> therapy and <#> hours at work .
wes again giving me shit because for some reason he doesn’t know what my restrictions are ; granted they have been the same since <#> .
"<#> – <#> long weekend off , didn’t do much ."
did spend time <UNK> my front <UNK> as it looked like shit .
"those bastards , when they replaced my <UNK> , they did it with <#> that was covered in <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> seems to work fine , just looked horrible ."
"back was really hurting though , had to keep it short ."
"gary called ; he has the race tickets and said we get a bus ride to the race also , with free snacks and beer ."
"<UNK> ’s ( a shrink with <UNK> ) office called , best they can do is <#> weeks ."
"<UNK> gave me a <UNK> to a <UNK> , not a <UNK> ."
also has me on same <UNK> for next <#> weeks plus a new muscle <UNK> to take at night .
<#> it ’s getting harder and harder to remember to write down the <UNK> activities .
and i went to the race on <#> .
"i was really hurting , but didn’t let it bother me , as i wanted to have fun ."
"when i got home , i iced , took muscle <UNK> and was asleep before <#> pm ."
<#> was horrible ; i was soo sore .
"besides my back and shoulders , my knees hurt badly too ."
"had therapy at <UNK> , but nothing helped ."
"<#> was a little better , but still hurt ."
"should have gone for shots , but was too lazy and too sore ."
"<#> had therapy early , didn’t use <UNK> , i hurt so much"
i took <#> of the new muscle <UNK> before work .
"the 13th , 14th & 15th i worked <#> hours ."
"as much as i wanted to leave early those days , i pushed till 5:30 ."
"all week , everyday they have been needing <#> hours of <UNK> would have gotten forced everyday ."
"in doing so , i find myself taking muscle <UNK> more and longer periods on ice ."
<UNK> the pain is only good for so long .
taking the <UNK> first thing in the morning is the only thing that allows me to get past the pain first off .
it ’s not getting better and i’m tired of all the drugs and the ice .
i made an appointment today for a shrink at <UNK> for the 30th at <UNK> .
"maybe she can help , i’m just so tired of all the pain ."
the only people i seem to talk to anymore is people at friday ’s and karen ( she has enough of her own problems ) .
things must be bad if i’m <UNK> him away .
for some reason my left arm and shoulder have been in a lot of pain .
<#> i worked <#> hours ; think it was a mistake as i hurt a lot .
"i was under the jeep , painting the <UNK> that was replaced ( black flat <UNK> ) ."
"when i got done , i was using the <UNK> <UNK> to clean the hood , get rid of dirt and <UNK> ."
"as i did , i noticed problems in the paint from the body shop ."
"took the old ( store bought ) cds to disc <UNK> , they only took <#> for $ <#> ."
i need $ bad enough to sell a large part of my cd collection .
"helped out karen at tiger , she bought me a <UNK> of <UNK> for helping ."
"<#> felt well , therapy hit me hard and i stayed at work for the <#> hours ."
"it hurt , won’t know till tomorrow if it was that stupid to work the <#> ."
tomorrow is maria ’s last day at <UNK> .
mom ’s being a real pain in the ass .
she emailed on the 11th and then again on the 12th .
i emailed back telling her that i was just busy and tired and would write soon .
this past weekend ( friday - sunday ) she must have tried <#> or <#> times .
"thanks to my answering machine message , she won’t leave a message ."
she just doesn’t understand that i don’t want to talk .
"<#> worked <#> hours <UNK> , did nothing much last night ."
"when i got up today , i thought maybe i was feeling better ."
went about <#> hours before i gave in to the pain and took the <UNK> .
"as i told wes tuesday , everyday i go to work , i <UNK> just depends on that day how long i can <UNK> the pain ."
i can’t even remember the last day that i wasn’t in some kind of pain .
"i can’t believe that this is just going get to better in time , the pain sucks ."
"as i am totally broke , going to go back over to disc <UNK> tonight and try to sell some more cds ."
i <UNK> the best condition ones from the rest .
i know it ’s not the first time the stones sold out to hawk products but this was always a favorite song of mine .
it ’s an <UNK> produced song that always gave me that special feeling inside whenever i heard it growing up .
everyone has songs that move him or her inside .
i remember seeing them live in <#> at <UNK> stadium ( back then people were wondering when they were going to retire ) .
i remember feeling that <UNK> well up in me when i heard the french horn accompany the acoustic guitar in the intro .
i guess that ’s what the song was about all along .
i want to break free ” for another spot .
i remember when the song came out around <#> .
i didn’t really think too much about it then but listening to it now i think it ’s a pretty good song .
some people might say what ’s the big deal anyway .
the big deal is that this music that i <UNK> was something that i could make my own .
the music and <UNK> of songs speak to people in different ways .
you can identify with sounds and lyrics that make a particular song unique for you .
"everything changes when songs like “ <UNK> <UNK> ” by the <UNK> , begin to sell <UNK> beer ."
songs of <UNK> and rebellion are now used to sell lousy beer .
"the songs that once put out the middle finger to this shit , have become part of madison avenue ."
"obviously it works to use celebrities and things familiar with consumers , such as songs , to help sell products ."
in the <#> ’s the california <UNK> had big success when they used the popular <UNK> <UNK> song “ i heard it through the <UNK> ” .
"i only knew <UNK> simon ’s song , “ anticipation ” , as the heinz ketchup song ."
there is no way that they wouldn’t at least try to use the most popular songs or artists to sell stuff . back in the <#> ’s
song for miller beer and stared in the commercials as well .
songs by <UNK> bands like the clash and the <UNK> just don’t seem <UNK> when they’re used to sell cars .
"you wouldn’t think these bands would be the first choice to help sell , sell , sell but their fans are now in their <UNK> and probably less <UNK> ."
<UNK> pop ’s “ lust for life ” has been used countless times to sell many different things .
nike used the beatles “ revolution ” to sell its <UNK> .
"paul <UNK> didn’t want them to use it , but michael jackson owned the rights so there was nothing he could do ."
however there was such a public <UNK> for using the song that nike eventually went in another direction .
i don’t believe a <UNK> ’s song has been used since .
"the artist , of course , can always choose not to sell their rights to <UNK> ."
<UNK> did not want microsoft to use their song “
it ’s the end of the world as we know it ” for the release of microsoft windows <#> .
"for the <UNK> latest commercial , i’m thinking that coca - cola made an offer that they couldn’t refuse ."
and i don’t mean they would have put a horse ’s head in each <#> of the <UNK> beds had they refused .
pete <UNK> must have realized the money to be made in allowing people to use your music for whatever .
"a perfect example is survivor ’s “ eye of the tiger ” which was a big hit and the theme song to rocky iii , back <UNK> ."
not only did they let starbucks use the song but they <UNK> the lyrics and <UNK> in the commercial as well . but that ’s such a lesser song .
a song like that might have well been written exclusively for a commercial anyway .
<UNK> roll elite seems to be the most popular choices these days .
i know that compared to things going on today ’s <UNK> world this does n't really matter .
there are certainly more important things to focus on than this .
"if an artist wants to sell the rights to their song , that ’s their business , regardless of how much i like it ."
"i guess i should be grateful , after all they could have used this song to sell <UNK> medicine ."
"i was satisfied because at least they were being called for what seemed like obvious <UNK> and fraud , but it did n't last long ."
"yesterday the army , for the third time , <UNK> that rule ."
probably what happened is that some big <UNK> of <UNK> gave old dick cheney a call and said what 's all this bullshit .
then cheney had some <#> deal with it which resulted in call to linda <UNK> .
"in the last couple of years , however , it ’s become apparent that the reality is much worse ."
"the realization that we are an <UNK> country doing whatever we want without any regard for world opinion has been a harsh , bitter pill to swallow ."
the <UNK> actually never stopped but today it 's more <UNK> and <UNK> than ever before with the us leading the way .
i was definitely naive as a lot of people are still naive today .
they do n't believe or wish to believe that america is guilty of any thing because we are america .
they don’t want to believe we are <UNK> as the countries and <UNK> in those history books .
the more people who stay naive the harder it will be to have a country that is a true democratic society that is really a <UNK> to the world .
"it is people associated with the bush government , big business and the military industrial complex , which has helped give america <#> black eyes and a fat lip ."
there is so much war <UNK> going on in iraq it ’s <UNK> .
"total <UNK> , with billions and billions of taxes dollars going to different well connected big corporations ."
"these corporations deal in <UNK> iraq ( including military bases ) , provide <UNK> for security , and a host of other things the army used to do ."
there is such little <UNK> in the ways these companies operate and do business .
there are many criminal <UNK> into the <UNK> of the american <UNK> by these corporations and no <#> seems to be talking about it .
employees of these companies are not held to the same standards that seem to get in the way of bush and company from doing what they want to do .
soldiers of fortune are not bound by any of the international laws demanding fair treatment of world citizens .
there is serious conflict of interests as former political <UNK> and other government employees now have financial ties to the <UNK> operations in iraq .
there are all these special <UNK> headed by well - connected people that tell these companies about the opportunities in iraq .
"it would help these companies greatly if they the made some significant campaign contributions to their <UNK> , congress people and political party ."
opponents of the war said before our invasion that this was all about money .
the us has not shown the world that .
it does not matter if their financial interests <UNK> with the best interests of the american people or whatever citizens in whatever country we help “ <UNK> ” .
"they all have the same interest , no matter what field or position they’re in ."
it ’s all just modern day rape and <UNK> .
"governor <UNK> needs to stop down now or an appropriate time for an <UNK> governor to be brought up to speed , like maybe <#> weeks ."
” if that 's the case that why his he waiting for <UNK> 15th to officially step down ?
"that is not fair to the people of new jersey , whether republican or democrat ."
"had it just been an <UNK> affair , i would believe that he should n't have to step down immediately or at all for that matter ."
it does not matter to me if it was a homosexual affair .
first it 's turning into a he said he said thing .
<UNK> has said he is heterosexual and that he was the victim of repeated sexual <UNK> and that it was the governor 's camp that offered him <UNK> money .
"also <UNK> , who is an israeli , was named by <UNK> to be the director of homeland security for the state of new jersey in <#> ."
this caused a lot of controversy as <UNK> felt this person was not experienced enough for the $ <#> a year job .
just these facts alone would make it hard for <UNK> to <UNK> effectively and <#> months is just too long <UNK> <UNK> .
"democrats have been worried that other <UNK> might see the light , further hurting the governor 's credibility ."
<UNK> 's have said <UNK> has nothing to do with their investigation of <UNK> .
"things like this , though , can cause the flood gates to open and not only drown <UNK> but also the new jersey democratic party ."
"he should not drag this out as his <UNK> in <UNK> , governor john <UNK> , has done ."
maybe <UNK> 's innocent of any <UNK> or maybe he 's not .
"<#> thing is for sure , <UNK> brought this on himself ."
i thought this whole having kids thingy was a good idea .
"i mean my parents did it , millions of people have done it , so it can not be "" that "" bad .... ha !"
"i was hood - <UNK> , <UNK> , led <UNK> !"
"it is very difficult , mentally , and you end up bone weary physically ."
"for example , my <#> year old has just decided to begin going to the <UNK> ...."
she has known how to do it for months .
she would have been just as happy to sit in a puddle of pee ( or other <UNK> <UNK> ) if i let her .
then <#> day she just made a <#> degree <UNK> .
"she not only was going , but alone , and did n't want any help ."
then there 's the whole attitude change that came with the new <UNK> independence .
"gone is my sweet baby that did what i asked without question , and rarely had a temper <UNK> ."
"i 'm whining , i know .... but that s what i feel like doing here ."
it will keep me from showing frustration with her if i get it out by another method .
"i am surrounded by so - called "" perfect "" parents that are super dedicated and enjoying every minute of their "" darling "" kids ."
"( which , by the way i do well , and <UNK> . )"
"oh , how i long for the <UNK> of the days of single - life , with no <#> to take care <UNK>"
follow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> argue <UNK> or clean up after but my self .... if i felt like it .
"mess to conquer , <UNK> to change , <UNK> to give , stories to read ( pause , then start <UNK> .... no rest for the weary ."
it was n't quite as i remember it when i was <#> years old ...
"i can remember when i went as a kid , it was huge and exciting and i wanted to do everything and there was never enough time ."
"now that i 'm a little older , i am wondering what was so exciting ."
but we still had a great time .
ken and i rode the batman and the superman .
<#> very high tech rides than what we were ever used to .
"i guess those old <UNK> roller <UNK> were the fad of our times , but nothing compared to the batman ."
it was the best i have been on .
but it was to short and not enough twists and turns for me .
it was great to walk through the amusement park with ken .
<UNK> brought her friend <UNK> and they went off to have their own fun .
"it 's funny , it has been a <#> - <#> that i have been living with ken and his family ."
"i do n't feel any different than the first time i met him , other than closer and absolutely comfortable ."
"he 's my <UNK> and still till today , he looks at me and i still melt ."
"i guess that is because we continue to work on our relationship , remember being friends is important and to accept the ups and downs ."
but to pay attention to those moments and recognize them .
"do n't <UNK> them , rather handle them at the moments time and not dwell on them ."
tomorrow i will have to work on our computers .
"yes , we have a virus in the systems ."
"so , i guess that means for the next few days i 'll have to back everything up , <UNK> the drives and get us up and going again ."
ken has a class this weekend to attend for the <UNK> training and we are planning a huge bar b que for everyone attending .
"i , of course , will be cooking on the grill , some ribs and make a few <UNK> ."
i enjoy people so very much and love to entertain .
we have a local range we belong to and truly enjoy being with others with the same hobbies in <UNK> and <UNK> .
"well , it has been a long day and i think i am going to turn in . until i write again ."
i suppose i am getting a little sleepy .
i thought i would go to bed but i could n't stop messing around with the <UNK> of this new blog .
i have had a cold for the last few days and have slept in for most of the day today .
i 'm tired but i 'm not sure if i can actually get to sleep .
"my <UNK> , ken , who you 'll hear about from time to time in my postings is taking me along with his daughter and her friend ."
i have n't been there for over <#> years .
"well , i suppose i had better <UNK> myself in to bed . until i write again ."
i am an artist who 's time has come and gone and has come and went and who sees and sees again .
"of course , none of this <UNK> <UNK> may make any sense to anyone other than me , but that is fine ."

i suppose by writing i can keep up with it .

"diana <UNK> as a witch , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and people <UNK> up in <UNK> ‘"

urllink birth photography online store | <UNK> my online store
urllink store shopping is <UNK> > just a little joke .
well i have now put my store in effect .
....... <UNK> photography ... models .... <UNK> .... <UNK> .... pets still waiting for the server to get back up .
i really have some new ideas for this particular site .
urllink other links are of me are here if anyone would liek to see were i am posted .
"groups : <UNK> i joined this group yesterday , but i <UNK> heard back from the <UNK> of the group ."
"i have n't been online for awhile , but i will be back ."
"i also did n't get out for photos today , must be <#> of those days for me ."
i entered this picture in a photo contest site .
this is <#> of the first photos i took of my <UNK> .
"i think she 's getting use to a camera , because everytime i take it out ."
i love you <UNK> ! urllink posted by urllink hello
i love the way it 's appearance can capture a room .
this is victoria c. <#> of the models that i have come to respect and also enjoy being around .
this <UNK> a flower i saw <#> day just walking <UNK> n the street .
"i have a clue , but yet i may be stepping ahead of myself ."
"that 's would n't bother me , but i know it can be a challenging situation . home"
<UNK> we 'll since i also joined a new group today .
i have always wanted to get a female on a bike .
i wander if people actually enjoy art of animals or pets anymore .
"today i will be working on photos that i have worked on in the past year , here in jersey ."
i have done a few <UNK> for models . as well as nature and landscape .
"i am not sure of what i should do next , because editing my site takes quiet a bit of time ."
"nevertheless , i will be working through - out the day of <UNK> this goals ."
"more photos are also added in my group , but i am wandering if i should just <UNK> most of the photos ."
i think i know why i have been in a blah mood all week .
seems like a cold virus has worked its way into my system .
i could nt figure out why i was so tired .
hopefully i can get over it before too long .
"i am usually not <#> to lie around when sick , but right now i could sleep hours ."
"saturday does n't look so great for weather , but sunday looks pretty awesome ."
interesting to see if i have improved any skills .
"i seem to have the "" divide and <UNK> "" attitude when biking ."
i do n't think its <UNK> but more stupid than anything .
i seem to have a bit to say today .
the <UNK> in my brain is still an issue .
"i gave away to my <UNK> a few of the duties i had before , because the <UNK> portion of my job was taking up more time ."
what was the point of getting rid of some if they keep giving me more ?
people seem to like to talk to me about their feelings or what s going on in their lives .
"i do n't mind listening , helping or sharing advise ."
but i think i take on the burden of their problems sometimes .
i want to help and free them of their pain somehow .
is it my personality that makes people <UNK> towards me when they are feeling the <UNK> of their lives ?
i took on the burden of someone 's problem last night .
but there is nothing i can do . seriously .
that helped him a lot and he appreciated it .
so why do i still feel blue about it ?
that <#> rolls off your back once you are done with it .
<UNK> who do i talk to about my blue mood ? that s another <#> of my problems .
"i have been getting better , but not where i should be ."
i think i feel intimidated by my mouth not being able to <UNK> <UNK> what my mind is thinking .
"i know what i need to say , but it always comes out wrong or backwards or not the way i want ."
"so therefore , it stays <UNK> around in my brain , making me crazy ."
did my first over the handle bar face plant last night .
"well it was more of a side , hands , cheek plant ."
amazing the formula that has to be in place for that .
"not quite enough speed on a semi technical , slight downhill , ass not over the back wheel , "" <UNK> stone "" in middle of the trail ."
i somehow managed a <UNK> in my left <UNK> though .
"i think that was on another part though , not the crash and burn ."
maybe because i have n't had a real scare yet .
the crash i had where i got the nasty <UNK> on my left butt was bad .
"never came so close to <UNK> , but still , i ride ."
i might have to resort to full <UNK> pretty soon .
its been a few days since i have posted to this thing . probably because the only computer time i have is at work .
well its not even <UNK> the <#> at my house .
funny how you do n't miss something until its gone .
i mainly used the computer at home to play music and do banking .
i suppose i should <UNK> what i have been doing since i last posted on the 11th .
"i actually did a vacation , not the usual running around climbing this , riding that ."
my brain needed a break not to mention my body .
"don , bailey and i stayed at his brother 's cottage on grand lake ."
"i still love it there , although my <UNK> skills were non <UNK> ."
"then again , i had n't stuck my butt in the boat for a while ."
i actually feel like i am doing something and my body <UNK> from it .
i almost feel embarassed to wear something that shows my legs .
"when i looked at my legs , i felt like hiding them ."
"but as <#> co - worker put it "" we do n't notice things like that "" ."
guess beauty is in the eye of the <UNK> and not the <UNK> <UNK> .
:) as i look back at what i have typed ... random .
but i guess the thoughts are really connected .... to me .
i suppose this is a journal of sorts . put down anything and everything .
why would i want to put down what i had for supper and that funny thing bailey did ?
"i 'd like to post "" adventures "" , but those are few ."
hopefully they will hold up for the race on sunday .
"i am not participating in this <#> , i do nt think ."
nothing more <UNK> when you feel something in your mouth .
i thought it was <UNK> ... wish it had been .
to some i seem to lead an extraordinary life . or out of the ordinary .
"i suppose because i do n't sit on the couch or snack my way into <UNK> , it would seem different to some ."
i wonder sometimes if i need to be doing more .
but there are days i want to do less .
i wonder how people could do it day in and day out .
"work , eat , sleep and throw an excessive amount of tv in there somewhere ."
the <#> hr epic ride seemed to be forgotten .
maybe be because my body had recovered and i felt no ill effects .
why do i feel the need to be constantly on the move ?
does my mind need to focus on anything but what is going on in my life ?
i am the most content that i have been in years . or am i ?
i think i have drank too much coffee today .
sometimes i wonder if i have a creative <UNK> in my body .
i think mine was in another room when creative genes were passed out .
"labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will "" die in the party "" ."
blair said that he was n't born in to the party but he will die in it .
we could n't even be bothered to count the bodies .
if anyone stayed in the labour party after abu <UNK>
i wonder what they joined the labour for in the first place .
"if it was n't for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be <UNK> , at least it was <UNK> for humanity ."
"your money has paid for a <UNK> , election winning machine that believes in <UNK> , war and <UNK> ."
all the talk of saving the labour party from blair is to miss the point .
when a party becomes part of the problem it does n't deserve to survive .
the dead children in iraq will never be brought back .
the <UNK> would never have got the votes in the <UNK> to conduct such a filthy war .
only a labour party <UNK> at the feet of it 's leader could have pulled this off .
i will never <UNK> the labour party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify <UNK> in such an ignorant <UNK> manner .
my new pledge is that i will die outside the labour party .

"here 's reality . just like trade in goods , trade in services forces painful <UNK> of employment ."
"however , the truth is that <UNK> is less of a threat than us workers understand , and there are enormous benefits to the us economy ."
there is n't a <#> - for - <#> relationship between jobs lost in the us and those gained overseas .
"for example , <UNK> of it services typically leads to domestic job losses of less than <#> percent ."
"to say that more clearly : for every <#> jobs sent overseas , only <#> us jobs are actually lost ."
"part of this <UNK> because , as low value - added jobs go abroad , labor and investment can switch to jobs that generate more economic value ."
": employment has <UNK> , but workers have moved into educational and health services where pay is higher ( and conditions often more <UNK> ) ."
the increases in <UNK> that corporations will be able to enjoy will also have <UNK> benefits .
"for example , the <UNK> of computer hardware <UNK> led to a <#> percent to <#> percent decline in prices ."
this made computer equipment more <UNK> and led to a far greater increase in jobs in the long run than were lost initially when production went abroad .
"in another thread , someone mentioned the fear of shipping technical <UNK> overseas ."

<#> of the things that is frequently dismissed by those to the left of center is whether any form of media bias exists .

"also , <#> of the top <#> newspapers are <UNK> liberal in their <UNK> ."
"the media provides the information that supports their world view , even if it means not providing context or ignoring things that <UNK> their ideology ."

look at how the media <UNK> the tax cuts as <UNK> only the ' rich ' .

i assume that most people who become journalists do so to ' make a difference ' .
and ' making a difference ' is what the liberal vision is all about .
"both are groups of people that have a vision of an <UNK> society , which is both noble and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"you also encounter this mindset of an <UNK> world among the <UNK> and <UNK> elite , so these natural tendencies are <UNK> along the way ."
reporters try to <UNK> a ' problem ' in the form of a single example that can be <UNK> on the news .
the difficulty with that approach is that sometimes the ' problem ' does n't exist in the manner portrayed or is so unbelievably complex it ca n't be solved .
but that does n't stop our <UNK> do - <UNK> from trying to ' make a difference ' .
"now , i do n't find fault in the majority of reporters ."
"they are trying to do a job they believe in , and should be <UNK> ."
"plus , they worry about making their stories ' accessible to the audience ' ."
which means <UNK> down the subject matter and making it <UNK> .
"the reality is that people with the the ' noble vision ' desire to change the world , based on the wisdom of the few ."
"and they naturally drift towards those <UNK> that allow them to do that , regardless of all of the evidence that <UNK> the <UNK> of that vision ."
"before we can discuss it , let ’s define what i am talking about ."
"everyone believes that some things are relative , but <UNK> claims that all things are inherently relative ."
"as far as i can find , there are <#> types of <UNK> : <UNK> , <UNK> , moral and religious <UNK> ."
you can claim that there are no <UNK> anywhere in reality – that ’s <UNK> .
and finally you have no <UNK> in religion – that ’s religious .
"religion is about relationships with the absolute , so religious <UNK> says there is no absolute best or <UNK> method for communicating with god ."
"<UNK> <UNK> is the same as <UNK> – it says that perhaps there is a god , but it can’t be known ."
"religious <UNK> says that there are moral <UNK> , such as the golden rule , but no religion has it absolutely correct ."
"<UNK> means , so i’ll skip defining it unless specifically requested ."
"‘ <UNK> is always relative to something else , <UNK> upon something else , or <UNK> on something else ."
"not <UNK> , not <UNK> but necessary , not conditioned but <UNK> ."
"there are no <UNK> for time , place , or <UNK> ."
the reason i take such care in defining the terms we use is to properly frame the discussion .
let me begin by saying that i am a believer in moral <UNK> .
i think that there is an absolute right and wrong .
i think that moral <UNK> crosses all cultures and <UNK> throughout history .
"right and wrong are taught by all cultures , showing that we are all born with a moral <UNK> pointing the difference between right and wrong ."
and i think that <UNK> data proves that out .
the first and <UNK> moral experience that we all have is always <UNK> .
"that ’s why little kids are always so ‘ black and <UNK> there is an absolute measure of right and wrong , <#> that stretches across humanity ."
it is only through knowing the absolute that we are able to raise ourselves and make progress .
"when you are drowning in <UNK> , you can not lift yourself out by your <UNK> ."
there has never been a successful society which <UNK> moral <UNK> .
it is widely mentioned by those who believe in moral <UNK> that different cultures have different moral values .
the premise of this argument is that moral <UNK> and <UNK> are relative to culture because what is right in <#> culture is wrong in another .
"because a culture ’s values differ from <#> culture to another , moral <UNK> <UNK> from <#> culture to another ."
this is important because there can be a difference between what is believed to be right and wrong and what actually * is * right and wrong .
"just because the nazi thinks <UNK> is right , doesn’t make it so ."
"but upon investigation , the differences between cultural rights and <UNK> are always rooted in a difference of interpretation of a deeper , underlying moral agreement ."
"sure , there are differences , but they are like <UNK> on an elephant – a lot of little <UNK> <UNK> around a big agreement ."
"to say it another way , the differences between cultures are usually differences in emphasis , not a whole new value system ."
there has never been a <UNK> <UNK> of opinions about values that the <UNK> <UNK> .
moral <UNK> in history have been either matters of degree or <UNK> about how to apply a more basic value that both agree upon .
these <UNK> share the same morals as a common premise .
"if you don’t have a common premise , you can’t have a <UNK> about how to apply that premise ."
the fact that <#> culture values or <UNK> <#> moral differently than another culture only proves both cultures recognize that moral and that these morals are universal .
this truth can also be found in language : all cultures have words that represent the same moral <UNK> .
"if you disagree with that , try to imagine a totally new morality ."
you can’t <UNK> another morality any more than you can imagine a new set of numbers or colors .
"for quite a while now , democrats in general have accused the administration of being <UNK> ."
no evidence has yet been presented that bush lied or <UNK> intelligence to <UNK> justify a war .
this sort of behavior <UNK> my belief that the democrats have no platform other than ' get rid of bush ' .
the invasion of afghanistan and the <UNK> of the <UNK> was <UNK> –
"while many on the left completely ( and perhaps <UNK> ) opposed taking action after <#> , bush <UNK> special forces into afghanistan within the next couple of days ."
"in a region that had never been <UNK> , he created an <UNK> combination of local support and us military might ."
those with no knowledge of geography or military experience place the blame for losing bin laden at bush ’s feet .
"the mountains between pakistan and afghanistan cover enormous amounts of ground , made up of incredibly difficult <UNK> that our <UNK> knew"
<UNK> is an immensely popular figure in the region and has both a friendly <UNK> to aid him and people around him with <UNK> loyalty .
president clinton had made regime change in baghdad official us policy .
"for a decade , saddam ’s forces had fired almost daily on coalition aircraft ."
from <#> to <#> the cia <UNK> <#> intelligence reports from multiple sources where iraqi agents planned for or attempted attacks against us or israeli targets .
"during this time , saddam also offered substantial financial support to palestinian terror groups ."
"” <UNK> , there were a dozen or so reports of iraq training al qaeda <UNK> in combat and the use of weapons –"
"conventional , bomb - making , chemical , biological , and <UNK> ."
"in <#> , a <UNK> from saddam offered <UNK> safe haven in iraq should he be <UNK> from afghanistan ."
<#> final bit of trivia : both the <UNK> and <#> of those who carried out the first world trade center bombing were iraqi .
"after the successful bombing , the iraqi <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , returned to baghdad ."
it was a massive attack that screamed of state <UNK> .
<#> of the camps that the cia had reported on was <UNK> <UNK> – which included with its facilities a mock - up <#> used in <UNK> training .
"on <#> with <#> planes down , the twin towers in <UNK> , and the pentagon <UNK> , only a fool wouldn’t have asked whether iraq could be involved ."
the really shocking thing is the <UNK> with which richard <UNK> <UNK> even the possibility that iraq could be involved .
the man who took months to determine that al qaeda had attacked the <UNK> cole knew within hours of the attacks that iraq couldn’t have been involved .
perhaps george bush had the intent of <UNK> iraq all along .
"if so , it at least wasn’t his first priority – as no <#> has suggested that any steps were taken towards this goal before <#> ."
it might be more fair to say that he would have been glad to take out saddam should the opportunity and reason to do so arise .
"the democrats agreed with this idea , and their president had signed this as policy into law almost <#> years before ."
the idea that there was significant <UNK> about iraq ’s <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> .
there are dozens of quotes even from those most actively against the war <UNK> their basic acceptance of iraq as having <UNK> .
we should also remember that we have always <UNK> the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction . . .
"saddam 's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to america , now ."
"saddam has used chemical weapons before , both against iraq 's enemies and against his own people ."
he is working to develop delivery systems like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against u.s .
there was <UNK> over some details of wmd reporting –
"it is easy look back in <UNK> and say , “ oh i knew all along ” but those voices simply were not raised ."
"the voices that were raised called for <UNK> instead of invasion , but the <UNK> process was <#> of the worst <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in history ."
the only times the <UNK> found anything was after <UNK> came forward – at which point huge secret programs would be <UNK> .
"more recently , <UNK> would be the source for minor <UNK> reporting used ( the mobile <UNK> labs being the only real <UNK> ) ."
"but given saddam ’s history , no <#> serious thought that he had either <UNK> nor that he would fully <UNK> this time around ."
the best intelligence available to the administration showed a clear pattern of <UNK> and planned aggression towards the us .
the just - released senate report on pre - war iraq intelligence completely <UNK> the administration of even the hint of <UNK> .
office of the <UNK> of defense that some <UNK> as “ second guessing ”
"conclusions by the intelligence community , did no such thing ."
this office <UNK> various reports that had been left out of more recent finished products .
it was then up to the cia to review the <UNK> made by this office and then decide whether to update intelligence products .
both the senate report and recent reporting in the financial times have shown joseph wilson to be flat out lying about many things .
": his wife indeed did get him the job – not really something a secret agent would be doing ,"
but then she had long before <UNK> to desk <UNK> duty .
"joseph wilson also never met with any current <UNK> official on his trip , but only met with limited contacts in the private industry and former officials ."
the prime minister at the time believed that this was an <UNK> by iraq to purchase <UNK> .
"later , wilson claimed to the washington post to have seen <UNK> documents that he had never seen ."
"so the author of the original “ bush lied ” conspiracy , the <#> that started all the rest , is nothing but a liar himself ."
"while the <UNK> reporting <UNK> to be based on analysis and <UNK> , these claims were about weapons and materials <UNK> for ."
some of these materials are now being <UNK> for – samples of the very same <UNK> and mustard gas shells claimed by the administration have indeed been found .
"and unlike the overly optimistic <UNK> of so - called experts , the chemicals in these weapons are no less <UNK> or deadly for their age ."
"the combined chemical weapons found in iraq could kill <UNK> of thousands of people , used properly ."
"as far as programs , saddam has hidden his biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons programs , not <UNK> of them ."
"saddam hid the components of his programs throughout iraq , to be <UNK> after <UNK> were lifted ( something actively sought by france and russia ) ."
the collective big picture about iraq is as strong and clear today as it was before the war .
"saddam supported and <UNK> with terrorists , including al qaeda ."
"saddam had hidden programs for weapons of mass destruction , which he had no intention of <UNK> ."
there is no denying any of these facts .
this is why the left can not be allowed to regain power .
"the intelligence about saddam may have been flawed , but it painted the same picture for democrats as for republicans ."
our security and survival – on which we should be fully united .
"we were , before the war ( or to be precise , before the election season began ) ."
leading democrats who <UNK> the administration now used the exact same language about saddam as did the president and vice - president in the months before the war .
"if democrats had merely opposed the iraq war , that would have been bad enough ."
"in fact , they supported it – for selfish political purposes , thinking that in a time of war , this would get them <UNK> ."
"they did the right thing , but for completely <UNK> reasons , shown clearly by their <UNK> of principle as soon as their seats were safe . and"
the current democratic presidential ticket represents the worst of the worst .
john kerry can not claim to be the same .
"he had the same access to intelligence as the president , and supported the war ."
kerry made the same claims about iraqi <UNK> and terrorist ties as the president .
the fact that he now uses words like “ <UNK> ” should automatically <UNK> this man from any office .
"<#> years ago he <UNK> <UNK> honorable people with <UNK> charges for his own gain , and he does it again today ."
the democrats inability to recognize our common threats and goals proves that they are incapable of leading the country in a time of war .
their willingness to lie and <UNK> the public about their own positions and statements shows that they have only their own naked interest in gaining power on their agenda .
"in the face of apparent threats , how <UNK> should the us act ?"
can we address terrorism without de - <UNK> the <UNK> of terror ?
should we assume that <UNK> that have dozens of friendly contacts with terrorist groups to be no threat ?
can we defeat <UNK> <UNK> in the middle east without <UNK> democracy there ?
"is it better to wait out the middle east and hope things work out before iran becomes a nuclear power , or should we <UNK> now ?"
we are not done spilling blood in the middle east – our blood and that of both enemies and <UNK> alike .
"do we impose our will at the cost of blood , treasure , and the hatred of the world ?"
"if not , are we content to lose <UNK> or hundreds of thousands of innocent american lives –"
"surely the cost once the inevitable happens , and terrorist groups obtain wmd <UNK> from <UNK> we allowed to stay in power ."
"john kerry <UNK> the term ' silver spoon ' , never having to grow up and live for <#> minutes in the real world ."
nearly half of this country claims to be planning to vote for kerry - edwards .
do what you can to wake them up to the reality that <#> wasn’t a <UNK> . or be prepared to face much worse days yourself in the future .
thanks to the guys at urllink <UNK> ( over <#> content - beware )
it 's been a long time since i watched the olympics .
"it seems to me that the olympics is no longer about being higher , faster or stronger , it 's all about money ."
"it 's no longer about coming together to compete in a spirit of <UNK> , it 's about gathering as many <UNK> as possible ."

"we can not accept the presence of anyone in international events under the flag of that regime . """
heaven forbid that muslims and jews actually meet on a field of battle where they ca n't actually kill each other .
"admittedly , <UNK> is not a shining example of religious tolerance , but iran is hardly <#> to throw stones either ."
"at best , the olympics are supposed to be about putting aside political differences and competing together as athletes first ."
"at worst , it 's about settling international differences using sport as the proving ground instead of the battlefield ."
what iran has done flies in the face of those ideals .
what has the <UNK> to say about this ?
"according to <UNK> representative <UNK> <UNK> : "" the issue has not actually come on the agenda of the <UNK> , "" she said at today 's press conference ."
i guess it would be too much to expect the <UNK> to take a moral stand on this issue .
haven 's know that they 've never done it before .
"it was n't <UNK> , he was murdered ."
and i know the identity of the <UNK> ! you can find the murder weapon at urllink
<UNK> i hope you have a strong stomach .
thanks to <UNK> over at urllink user friendly for the link .
"you need urllink <UNK> to view this , just follow the link ."
anyone seen the trailer for resident evil : <UNK> ?
( see it urllink here ) i 'm not a big horror or zombie fan . as a matter of fact
and signs can hardly be described as a horror flick .
i wo n't tell you what i did to my friend 's couch when i tried to watch the <UNK> horror .
"i am a <UNK> , i admit it ."
"that being said , i think i might go see this film or at least rent it ."
"well , as much as i love urllink <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> from the mummy movies ) , that is n't the reason ."
i want to see toronto 's city hall get blown to bits .
this is almost as big a thrill as seeing the white house get <UNK> in <UNK> day ( people in the theater cheered ) .
i just wish former mayor mel was inside the big white <UNK> when it exploded .
show him there 's more to worry about in the world than <UNK> <UNK> and their big <UNK> pot .

"according to <UNK> , a woman and her cat have been re - united after <#> years ."

"but he 's home where he 'll be loved and cared for , for however long he has left ."
"well , this is n't so much of a blog as a <UNK> through whatever happens to be working it 's way through my consciousness at any given moment ."
"so sit back and enjoy a guided tour through my id , ego and <UNK> ."
"devastating <UNK> , black cats , old horror movies and my birthday all have this in common this year : friday , august <#> ."
i turned <#> – let 's hope that in itself wo n't be a re - run of an old horror movie .
"actually , i feel quite hopeful about coming to some sort of peace , whether it comes from staying or going ."
finding peace and arriving at a <UNK> where i can accept what 's happened and feel like i can trust my husband is something i will strive for .
"i 'm always aware of the location of that exit door , tho ' ."
he 's keeping things from me that need to come forward ?
"what calm and relief i feel , <UNK> by those painful <UNK> - it 's almost out - of - body great ."
"i feel <UNK> gave me the wrong tools ; i want to do it , but ca n't get the stones to fit <UNK> and hold together ."
it 's a distance of maybe <#> of a mile .

"when my husband was pursuing a beautiful former co - worker a couple of years ago , he 'd email her daily ."
", she got bored of him , and then got bored of leading him on for her own ego - <UNK> pleasure ."
my hope is that son wo n't follow father 's footsteps .
i hope he 'll be sensitive and know when enough is enough .
maybe he 'll even be smart enough to not <UNK> his wife .
"i feel i should introduce myself , shake hands or something ."
"the fact is , i 've been addressing myself to you for a long time , and have a bit of a <UNK> of things to put forth ."
i want this to be an exchange because i need information .
it 's about a life that i 'm ready to <UNK> .
"basically , i 'm open to ( almost ) anything ."
"<UNK> [ sour ] = <UNK> , so <UNK> ? ?"
the children are in bed ; the <UNK> are making an <UNK> <UNK> .
"maybe tonight my husband will reach over and touch me - not with the "" you did a great job today - thanks ."
"oh , by the way , fabulous dinner "" pat on the back or ass , but maybe with some desire ."
i have – the way i rub away the growing - pains in the legs of our children .
i went to the coast with my husband 's family .
now it 's back to the old grind .
"it says : for august <#> : mars and mercury <UNK> your desire for change and variety , particularly in your residence ."
what worked in the past may no longer reflect your <UNK> needs and desires .
"excess energy , excitement or tension makes healthy physical exercise a necessity today ."
"without some form of exercise , your mind may never calm down ."
"on another front , you’re ready to invest in your future – and your future may involve property ."
you’re also eager to break tradition and <UNK> the odds .
is it any wonder that others find you so exciting ?
"anyways , i feel like i am in need of a change , but to what ?"
"it 's very busy , but busy with stuff that i ca n't even decide is important ."
"oh , well , enough of the self - involvement ."
i do n't have enough patience to look inside myself and try to figure out what 's going on .
"i skip back and forth between interesting ideas , <UNK> them with a "" blog that <#> later "" flag ."
"however , when i get to the blog , i forget the ideas ..."
my next few posts will cover such topics as : <UNK> <UNK> 's thoughts on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> men and women are <UNK> <UNK> is a god
it 's the end of the day for me at work .
"although the <UNK> part of the day will just be starting , and my mind is already <UNK> ."
i think it has to do with the fact i 'm a little confused as to my job situation .
"anyways , it 's as if <UNK> by going part - time all my <UNK> and insight are no longer valid ."
i am no longer an individual to which people come for input and ideas .
"i do n't know why i let it bother me , but i do ."
"i have put in <#> years with this company , mostly in a management , or at least leadership , position ."
my input being very <UNK> during pretty much the entire time .
"we did a <UNK> , and i now have a manager over me ."
"someone who really wants the job , but is about <#> years younger than me , and who has only worked here a little over a year ."
"i did after all make the decision to not come back full - time , otherwise i would have my current manager 's job ."
"i""m all of a sudden a non - entity ."
i also work at home on days i have off
", so i ca n't say that on average i 'm <UNK> during my days off ...."
"my days off , besides saturday and sunday , are wednesday and friday ."
"i have n't told anyone about this because i 'm not sure it 's an issue , but somehow , in my gut , i feel it is ."
"oh , well , at least i got it down on e - paper ."
"well , i just made my "" first time blogger "" mistake ."
"i entered my first message and promptly , accidentally deleted it ."
"anyways , my point with the original post , which i can not really <UNK> , was the fact that i have been writing in journals for years ."
i have actually had <#> particular journal going on <#> years now that i have n't finished .
i think the main reason i do n't write more often is because my hands are just lazy .
it 's hard holding a pen and moving my hand around a page .
"it seems easier just to type , although the act of typing can get pretty tiring as well ."
"i am looking forward to blogging , been thinking about it for awhile , and now i 've finally taken the <UNK> ."

"as you may know , lou reed 's satellite of love has been re - released ."
i mean what on earth would it be doing filled up with <UNK> ice cream ?
i looked up the lyrics and it was as follows :
i got his site shut down though lol black coffee <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> btw is nt urllink rachel <UNK> a babe ?
as anyone who has read the blog on black coffee in the past will notice that things have changed slightly .
the blog is now using blogger as it makes it much easier to update than messing around with html in <UNK> .
it also gives me chance to concentrate on the writing rather than whether i mess the layout up <UNK> adding pictures etc .
and hopefully it will allow me to update more the site is also not as direction <UNK> as it once was .
"now the site is going to be more <UNK> , in the direction of the web <UNK> thing i have on the main site ."
"in future , this blog will be linked to the front page ."
black coffee has been going since about <#> in its free <UNK> days and most of the content has been around since then .
"its way out of date , but my <UNK> page has got a lot of hits and has been linked from forums etc ."
i still get good comments and emails asking for <UNK> .
i * still * have nt got around to writing that php <UNK> the couple of years have seen changes to my attitude towards the web .
"coupled with that , there are <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i do nt visit as many forums as i used to .
all the websites i used to visit are either dead or dying on their arse .
"all this may seem negative , but its not ."
i do nt feel negative ; this is a positive time for me and for black coffee .
i do nt care what people think of the site .
"its whatever i want it to be ; and it that means it changes every so often , then so be it ."
"<UNK> is all about change , either in real life or on the web"
does nt this make you bloody sick ? ! ?
"this little <UNK> <UNK> gets £ <#> a month off the state to house him , his wife and <UNK> ! ) kids ."
he does nt work but says he would if he found a job that paid him enough to look after his <#> kids ( <UNK> ) .
"if they did nt want to get work , they would be <UNK> to a life of poverty ."
it makes me wonder why i bother working to be honest .
having been unemployed for very small periods when i was younger ( due to <UNK> )
"i hated it however , and could nt bring myself to live like that ."
it was a bad <UNK> when he came into power .
the first thing he did was have a celebrity <UNK> - fest at number <#> .
"stuff the working people of this country , he was more interested in being seen with celebrities ."
they have proved themselves to be <UNK> in the past .
"the whole government situation reminds me of the lyrics of a <UNK> wheel song : "" <UNK> to the left of me , <UNK> to the right ."
".... "" ever get the feeling you 've been cheated .... ?"
white powder and <UNK> <UNK> all over my kitchen work surface ?
"it this some sort of <UNK> <UNK> involving <UNK> "" tits out "" <UNK> and john "" i used to be famous "" leslie ?"
what they did nt bargain on was me being a complete <UNK> and not taking the <UNK> out before shaking .
thus the <UNK> ended up at the bottom of the tin and i created the <UNK> - mentioned mess trying to get it out .
"picture the scene ; a dark , <UNK> , smoke - filled pub , somewhere in deepest <UNK> ."
"groups of <UNK> gather , high on a cocktail of booze and <UNK> ."
i 'm so glad i did nt go out tonight .
"i could have got in the pub for <#> , after work if i had wanted to ."
i get so pissed off with drinking these days .
"according to sky news ( above link for more details ) : <UNK> are amongst the most <UNK> people in the world , according to a new survey ."
what is it about the british obsession with sex though ?
you only have to look at ' celebrities ' like jordan and <UNK> <UNK> ( i 'll use the word celebrity <UNK> <UNK> being more appropriate )
"i may be an old <UNK> , but i do nt find women like that attractive ."
"i would nt want to be seen out with a girl who would wear that little , for the simple reason that <UNK> would be <UNK> her all night ."
"<UNK> someone who <UNK> to that level , is a very needy and <UNK> person ."
"and on the subject of clothes and sexuality , has anyone noticed how <#> % of the girls these days are wearing ' <UNK> ' jeans ."

"the trend amongst <UNK> is also pretty worrying ; they to like to wear their <UNK> low <UNK> too , but this time <UNK> about <#> inches of <UNK> ."
"i think its a <UNK> thing , but i 'm not sure ."
but i ca nt see how girls could find this attractive .
"she 's a very professional <UNK> , always dressing well"
and she 's a bit of a babe too whilst searching the web for some pictures of her
a <UNK> <UNK> - fest if ever there was <#> .
"also contained on that site is a set of pictures of the equally lovely <UNK> <UNK> , another <UNK> <UNK> - babe ."
it seems i was a bit harsh on tom <UNK> about his urllink teens page in a previous entry .

"so next time theres a few spots of rain and you feel a <UNK> coming on , just think , it could be a lot lot worse ."
i have missed everyone for so long and think it 's great that we are all trying to keep in touch again .
"i did go to our <#> year reunion thinking i would get to see everyone from our "" gang "" , but nobody !"
that was the whole reason i went and so excited about this .
well let me let you in on what 's been going on in my life ... the short version .
"i have done the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> er and now gave up working nights , weekends , and holidays to work at a special needs day care ."
"i love it , but am a little bored , but being bored is n't a bad thing ."
it 's a lot less stress and the kids are great .

"i 'm glad that <UNK> <UNK> people from all walks of life , different ages , colors , etc ."
but there is such a huge variety of experience in our store - it is very strange .
we 've got <#> year old experienced professionals that could build a house from the ground up with a crew of <#> .
i guess variety is the spice of life . and let me tell you - my store has a lot of spice .
"( well , almost ) so my tv works <UNK> . fortunately"
", i have found a new anime to be addicted to : samurai <#> ."
the <UNK> story is set right smack in the middle of <UNK> japan .
"the series , so far , kicks an enormous amount of ass ."
"if you 're stuck , send me an e - mail and i 'll help out ..."
i 've read a lot of science fiction .
i mean a lot of science fiction .
"i 'm usually at a loss when someone asks me what my favorite book , series or author is ."
"typically , i 'll answer "" stranger in a strange land "" , "" the foundation / empire / robots books "" , or "" <UNK> <UNK> "" ."
"as a <UNK> , i was introduced to <UNK> ."
"it did n't make an impact on me until david <UNK> 's "" <UNK> "" movie came out in the 80s ."
i may be the only person i know who liked the movie ( long and short version ) .
these new books have increased my respect for the series a <#> fold .
"now , if anyone asks me who my favorite author and series is i do n't hesitate ."
i urge those of you who have n't read any of the <UNK> books to go grab them .
i have now sunk to the lowest possible level .
"i knew i 'd get around to it sooner or later , but it seems that it is the ultimate expression of <UNK> ."
i will be using this spot to be as direct and possibly offensive as possible on whatever happens to piss me off at a particular time .
i may even choose to highlight the rare things that do n't piss me off as well . or not .
"my name is wayne , and i am a sports addict ."
"sadly , the olympics has n't done a really good job of <UNK> me in this year ."
"in fact , i have n't really given a damn about the olympics since they decided to let professional athletes compete ."
professional athletes get enough television time as it is .
brett <UNK> is the 3rd leading <UNK> in <UNK> history .
"if i want to watch him blast <UNK> in to the net , i 'll watch a <UNK> game ."
i do n't need to watch him at the winter olympics .
"i 'd be more interested in watching the kid from nowhere , south dakota who plays on the pond and at his small college ."
i went to a store that i visit for <#> reason only -- they sell coke products for a buck a <#> <UNK> .
"i drink a hell of a lot of diet coke , and they are my <UNK> ."
"i am typically very <UNK> of other people 's religious beliefs , provided that they are not "" <UNK> "" or "" preaching "" at me ."
"after several minutes of standing at the counter holding an <UNK> of soda i said "" look people , jesus is n't paying for this soda -- i am ."
"actually , he looked like he wanted to <UNK> me ."
""" okay , jesus boy , you want to do something about it ? """
he got the message that he was walking on thin water and got out of my face .
i left the store and will never go back . ever .
"fortunately , it 's only family dollar , so there 's no sorrow there ."
that store sells nothing but shit anyway .
it 's worth my while to pay a few cents more and not have to listen to preaching outside of church .
i have been a registered libertarian for almost <#> years and have <UNK> supported libertarian candidates and their platform .
"mind you , i have no intention of changing my party <UNK> , nor do i have a problem with the libertarian party candidates or platform ."
it 's merely because i believe that the greatest danger facing the country today is george w. bush .
w is the most <UNK> moron to <UNK> the <UNK> of this country .
"i think dave <UNK> was right on the money when he said "" george w. bush - the president dan <UNK> we never had . """
do n't let the <UNK> or the supreme court decide this election .
<UNK> was the first real hurricane that i 've experienced .
i have a little more respect for them than before .
i live in winter springs ( central florida ) .
the first entrance is still blocked by an oak tree and there are branches of every type and size <UNK> the entire complex .
the power went out friday night at 9:30 pm but <UNK> was back on by saturday night ( in time for the saturday iron chef showing ) . fortunately
", none of my friends or family are any worse for the wear , even though there are still power issues throughout central florida ."
"i was n't very comfortable , so when the power came back on at 3:30 saturday morning , i opted to drive home ."
and it 's the longest <#> miles i 've ever driven .
"trees in the <UNK> , signs all over the place , <UNK> <UNK> , you name it ."
hopefully that will be the last central florida hurricane for another <#> years .
"in fact , he tried to help us once , and he fucked up good and right ."
it was and continues to be the mess known as iraq .
"<UNK> is a gift from the gods that i just so happened to receive upon <UNK> , so i speak from experience ."
"yet , i must be honest - the blessing of eternal <UNK> can occasionally turn around and bite the <UNK> in the balls ."
i 'll tell you what it leaves him with .
so what good is a president who has <#> skills and nothing but piss poor qualities ?
"along my travels i have read many <UNK> <UNK> articles making light of kerry 's striking <UNK> to the fictional mary <UNK> character , the <UNK> monster ."
i 'm sure he could borrow the <UNK> from bush . but
the most important of these qualities is that he has taken a human life .
"for <#> , it shows that he is a man who takes initiative ."
it proves that he can make decisions and stand by them .
"if that does not a leader make , then i shall fashion a <UNK> and <UNK> myself in the <UNK> right this very second !"
"in a perfect world , neither of these <#> <UNK> would have been <UNK> to run for the presidency in the first place ."
what we need is a president who will run this country the way it deserves to be run ; not some <UNK> <UNK> !
i 've been a <UNK> most of my life .
then i looked to the heavens and thanked the gods for providing me with yet another glorious <UNK> .
"i thought i heard a response , but soon realized it was merely a noise coming from behind the house ."
"as i <UNK> my <UNK> for a better listen , it seemed as though the noise was getting louder ."
"i made an attempt to run from the yard , but the <UNK> <UNK> were on me in seconds !"
", i believe i fought the good fight that day ."
"and as i crawled back to the abandoned <UNK> car that i had fashioned into a temporary home , i was filled with a new sense of purpose ."
a <UNK> of mine once equipped me with the knowledge that nurse sharks are apparently <#> of the most <UNK> species of shark in the great blue sea .
turns out i spent most of that time wandering the deck deeply <UNK> in the <UNK> haze of an <UNK> <UNK> .
"what an odd name for a ship , i thought to myself , <UNK> like santa <UNK> ."
only my belly was very much unlike a bowl of jelly .
"swimming around like giant <UNK> worms were <#> <UNK> , as i like to refer to them , <UNK> up at me ."
"i couldn’t be sure , but i thought i heard <#> of them say , “"
so i <UNK> my <#> - sizes too small ( for <UNK> purposes )
"<UNK> , <UNK> my <UNK> to my <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> my mind to concentrate on the task ahead ."
"so , with nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , an <UNK> , and not to mention my <UNK> intensity"
", i <UNK> into the chill waters of the mother atlantic that day and <UNK> invited all <#> of the “ <UNK> ”"
<UNK> symbols to engage in a bout of <UNK> . being that they were slightly better <UNK> than i
i could read their minds via the <UNK> expressions on their <UNK> little faces and i’ll tell you what they were thinking .
"holy <UNK> , what the hell did we go and get ourselves into ?"
this <UNK> before us is indeed superior in every possible way .
"at first it was difficult to <UNK> the awesome mass of greatness that is this man , yet alas , here it is , for all to see ."
” the <UNK> fish silently <UNK> with me to take pity on them .
their <UNK> shark eyes stared at me like black holes and i could almost swear on my <#> dead <UNK> <UNK> that i saw a tear .
"they were smart , i’ll give them that ; the stubborn bastards almost had me believing the <UNK> about them being <UNK> animals ."
"so rather than face such horror , i remained exactly where i was , albeit not taking into account the <UNK> <UNK> up and down caused by waves ."
", i hopped back onto the boat that sunny day and smiled to richard <UNK> ."
""" peanut <UNK> ass , "" i said to him , "" the <UNK> that has <UNK> today will forever change the course of world history ."
"sure , i lost a leg that day ."
"some say i lost a little respect , too ."
"not that i think about that kinda stuff , because i don’t !"
"but if i did , my answer would be “"
"no , i wouldn’t skip out on that part ! ”"
"in fact , you probably can’t even be certain then ."
"the lord knows i’ve <UNK> entire <UNK> during <UNK> sleep , so why the hell should death halt my <UNK> ?"
"well , lately i’ve been hearing tell of more peaceful ( and i suspect <UNK> <UNK> ) sharks and i’m <UNK> sick of it !"
they’re all vicious <UNK> as far as i’m concerned and i’m fully committed to proving it .
"some people have said to me , “ <UNK> , are you nuts ?"
making a claim like that just means you’re going to lose a leg either way .
what do you stand do gain by such an idiotic <UNK> ?
"” and i look them dead in the eye , wonder for a minute whether they are <UNK> with the sharks , and then i <UNK>"
: “ a leg is a <UNK> price to pay for an accurate <UNK> of the <UNK> of <UNK> species .
"” at which point <UNK> reply : “ but <UNK> , wake up !"

he was only <#> years old when he was killed cause of an accident while racing in south dakota on wednesday .
the pictures taken were just some of the people and friends that came to honor him at his funeral today and drove by his home .
we did not personally know him but his sister goes to school with <UNK> in the same grade .
it 's always a shame when someone so loved and in his prime of life must leave us so soon .
our hearts and prayers go out to the family .
urllink chicago <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kerry critics wrong what else is it going to take to <UNK> the false <UNK> made by the <UNK> swift boat veterans for truth ?
click on over to the chicago <UNK> to read the full account .
"you 'll have to register with them , however it 's free ."
"from the chicago <UNK> : <UNK> calls cheney 's words and actions ' <UNK> ' august <#> , <#> des <UNK> -- democratic <UNK> ."
"cheney , in campaign speeches , has been <UNK> that reference to <UNK> ."
"he said president bush and cheney are "" running scared because john kerry has a war record and they do n't . """
"he said of cheney , "" what he is doing and what he is saying is <UNK> ."
""" he 'll be tough , but he 'll be tough with someone else 's kid 's blood . """
republican national committee spokesman david james dismissed the criticism as <UNK> and negative .
cheney received <#> student and marriage <UNK> of military service .
bush was in the texas air national guard .
it takes someone with the stones of tom <UNK> to tell it exactly like it is .
day by day the message is getting out that the emperor has no clothes ... and not much of a brain either .
"by the way , can you think of a worse job than spokesman for the republican national committee ?"
this guy 's wife must steam clean him before allowing him in the house each night .
time to time i will find good candidates whose positions i agree with and find <UNK> to our society .
as i do i 'll post them and give you the option of going to their web site to see for yourself .
it seems like whenever president bush and vice president dick ‘
"<UNK> cheney question senator kerry ’s policy or votes , the senator usually <UNK> in some way ."
now i have a few questions for president bush and vice president cheney and since they’re not real good at answering questions : <#> ) mr .
<#> ) why you have to be <UNK> into appearing before the commission and only <UNK> to appear if vice president <UNK> could appear with you ?
why are you not bothered by someone in your administration outing a cia agent ?
that ’s against the law ; are you and yours above the law ?
"president , why didn’t you go to war with the <UNK> <UNK> strength as suggested by the army chief of staff general eric k. <UNK> ? <#> )"
why did you invade iraq without completing the invasion of afghanistan by <UNK> al <UNK> ?
<#> ) why did you let osama bin laden go at <UNK> <UNK> ? <#> )
why did you send american men and women into a war zone without <UNK> supplies ?
"president , where were you doing those months that can’t be <UNK> for in your military records ?"
"without a solid , <UNK> accounting many americans believe you went <UNK> –"
<#> ) in a debate against vice president gore in the <#> election you said that your tax cut would be <UNK> toward middle and lower income americans .
but the <UNK> americans received the bulk of your tax cuts .
your administration wrote and <UNK> for a prescription benefits bill that costs $ <UNK> more than it was <UNK> .
why did your administration threaten the job of the person who had the real cost figures ?
"<#> ) why are prescription drugs primarily more expensive for senior citizens now , after your prescription drug bill was passed , than before ?"
"i plenty of more questions , however i think it take everything you have to answer these <#> ."
get your research staff and <UNK> working on these – i’ll have more for you at a later date .
<#> reason <UNK> and <UNK> will be sad to see president bush go is because of the loss of actual quotes to write and joke about .
"for instance yesterday the president spoke to a rally in nearby <UNK> , virginia ."
"bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because "" the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway . """
"kind of reminds you of the clip in fahrenheit <#> where the president talks to his supporters , "" ..."
"the <UNK> and the have more , "" at a black tie dinner ."
if i follow his logic we should do away with many of our laws because criminals figure out to dodge them anyway .
however there 's a statement in the last paragraph of the story by a bush supporter at the rally .
"talking about kerry supporters who were <UNK> at the rally , she said , "" i just look at them and smile"
""" they 're damn lucky to be in this country because they would be <UNK> if they lived anywhere else ."
"i just pray that they will open their eyes . """

there are <#> things that <UNK> the crap out of me : waiting too long for <UNK> and waiting too long for people to get assignments back to me .
as far as waiting too long for people to get assignments to me …
"well , it ’s been developing over years ."
"call me <UNK> , but i think that <#> hours is plenty of time to get <#> tab pages <UNK> and returned ."
maybe it ’s the nature of the business that i’m in .
it ’s <#> long chain and i’ve got a weak link .
i don’t take my <UNK> out on other people ; i just <UNK> a bit .
"the thing is , i sort of understand why people sit on tasks ."
"i was a bad student during my student days , <UNK> to the point"
i thought that maybe teachers would forget that they gave me a homework assignment .

"get it done , have it done , be done with it ."
it ’s so much better this way . now
", how can i get some more disciples to the church of get it done ?"

i look at show guides and restaurant reviews every day and i can’t think of anything to do .
"you would think that i’d have a wealth of options at my <UNK> , but i’m blank ."
i’ll just take today ’s edition home and let him sort through it for something to entertain the <#> of us .
i’m sleepy and waiting for his plane to arrive .
( b ) <#> of the major aspects of “ the wild <UNK> ducks ” was the kevin <UNK> : boy <UNK> story .
( perhaps i should say “ stories ” as they were many . )
… and usually killed him in highly humorous ways .
i sit down and <UNK> a kevin <UNK> story .
"kevin <UNK> , boy <UNK> chapter <#> kevin woke up in a cold sweat ."
"did <UNK> suspect him of <UNK> during the lonely hours when she would take in tennis instructions from <UNK> , the <UNK> tennis pro at the club ?"
did she know anything of the shame that kevin felt <UNK> from his <UNK> like sunday morning tequila - sweat after a saturday night at the <UNK> <UNK> ?
"he had kept rebecca as his <#> , true secret ."
he had never intended for things to go so far .
really it was only a simple matter of coincidence … of timing … of chemistry .
"but , as he <UNK> her back to health , he fell for her … hard ."
it was only after that damned <UNK> bit him on the wrist that he became really nervous .
"but , he was bringing us down , so we dropped a <UNK> of bananas on his head to put him out of his misery ."

"<UNK> news of the day is <UNK> <UNK> a huge bush suck - up , or does he know something that we don’t ?"
the guy ’s been defending w. for months on all things intelligence - related .
you would think that a guy who was a former cia agent would …
"well , would at least keep quiet on the issue ."
time and time again he <UNK> up to defend bush .
<UNK> is a perfect guy ( from bush ’s point of view ) to take over george <UNK> ’s position as cia director .
"he ’s extremely loyal to bush , and he ’s very much for a strong , active , in - your - face kind of cia ."
<UNK> is also the worst guy ( from the <UNK> point of view ) to ally himself with the president .
"he ’s extremely loyal to bush , and he ’s very much for a strong , active , in - your - face kind of cia ."
"( yes , that was a repeat . )"
i’m reading a lot of opinions on <UNK> that say he ’s too “ political ” for the position .
"and , i do think that intelligence and politics never <UNK> ( hold for polite laughter ) ."
i’m not saying that the cia director should be someone at odds with the commander in chief .
"certainly , the <#> should trust and understand each other ."
"<#> of these guys should not be the <UNK> of the other , though ."
"thing is , the senate committee that would have to confirm <UNK> nomination couldn’t do so before november ."
"after november his nomination might be a <UNK> point , as kerry wouldn’t keep him ."
"is <UNK> <UNK> himself to bush in a pre - election push , hoping for a win and a better position for himself ?"
this always gives me a bit of a <UNK> feeling .

the nba champions just got finished playing a marathon of over <#> games .
"i 'm sure several of them have injuries , <UNK> or off - season <UNK> to attend to so they can be ready to defend their title in november ."
there 's no way a nba champion could repeat in the year following the olympics .
they would be wiped out and have no time to rest and heal .
i do n't think any nba owner would agree to this .
they want to sell <UNK> with <UNK> ' faces and numbers on it .
they want to put their rising stars on the international stage .
but next time give it a little more thought .
"the league and players have known for several years that their agreement <UNK> on september <#> , <#> ."
"then , when they schedule a meeting , less than a month before the <UNK> , it 's a meeting to schedule more meetings ."
"with leadership like this , it 's no wonder this league is fading ."

"today , they 're all talking like they predicted it ."
they’re just a bunch of spoiled <UNK> that hate their country !
” they may as well pack it in and head home .
how could we be losing our <UNK> on our game ?
we used to just roll the balls out there and pick up our gold medals .
"we still have that attitude , at least usa basketball does ."
it was inevitable that the usa would lose in the olympics .
"hell , they got <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the world <UNK> in <#> ."
"although that team had an excuse , they were <UNK> by george karl and"
we lost the <UNK> and we didn’t change anything <UNK> how we select our international team . and that ’s the whole problem with this thing .
"now , after a stunning loss , everyone acts like they care ."
but where were all of these experts when the team was picked ?
don’t even think about international competition in any sport until nbc tells us to every <#> years .
"in australia and japan , the <UNK> that compete in the olympics are national <UNK> ."
our own track athletes have to go to europe to gain fame and fortune .
"basically , we don’t want to hear about olympic sports ."
it ’s been knocking at the door and <UNK> in the window for decades .
"i’m sick of hearing about this , so i won’t bore you with it ."
( <UNK> ) there is no central voice that designs a plan for the us team .
the coach ( when he ’s not <UNK> his nba team <#> hours a day ) names his team .
they want the most <UNK> faces on the team .
not the best team . - no preparation .
the guys get together <#> weeks before the games after laying around for <#> months after a lengthy nba season .
"not only do they barely know each other ’s games , but they’re not back in shape yet ."
new rules and crazy officials have the pro players scratching their <UNK> and frustrated .
many of the players on international <UNK> have directly <UNK> from american <UNK> .
that ’s an on - going theme throughout all of the olympic sports though .
how many times foreign medal winners either currently train in the us or trained here .
just realize that they are “ victims ” of a dated an obviously <UNK> system .

virtually all fantasy football <UNK> require you to have at least <#> tight end on your <UNK> .

boo williams was also # <#> in this category .

fortunately batch was n't on your list of fantasy <UNK> 's ( was he ? ) .
up to now you have been subject to the mad fantasy football ramblings of our resident <UNK> doc <UNK> .

these are used to <UNK> more than <#> <UNK> values that are then applied to the individual setting for each of the <#> <UNK> listed .

jackson could be better this year if only he can remember to catch the ball .

"<UNK> robinson , <UNK> – another fantasy football <UNK> !"
"this year , has the possibility to do better than jackson ."
"bobby <UNK> , <UNK> – a good solid <UNK> with the ability to get open ."

brown misses too many opportunities with his ugly <#> % <UNK> <UNK> .
he ’s a <UNK> even as a back - up <UNK> .
<UNK> defense – a good fantasy football d last year .
they tried to fill some holes in the off season .
expect a better pass rush but there are possible problems against the rush .
did they fill the holes or simply move them around ?
most fantasy football sites don’t expect much from <UNK> this year .
"a below average ( and sore ) arm , <UNK> surgery , with <UNK> at <UNK> certainly seem to justify that ."
"but , since i don’t give a rat ’s <UNK> for what they say , i’m going to rank <UNK> as a good fantasy football back - up <UNK> ."

to <UNK> to use a fantasy football draft pick for now .
"<UNK> hamilton , <UNK> – expect hamilton to challenge <UNK> and possibly woods before too long ."
will probably be a decent mid - season addition .
"eric johnson , te – might be a great sneak pick ."
"with a bunch of young <UNK> ( and <#> ancient <#> ) , johnson could end up seeing an above average number of <UNK> heading his way ."
"todd <UNK> , k – <#> % may not seem spectacular , unless your home field is <UNK> ."

<UNK> defense – a good solid # <#> defense .
"in spite of all the changes and missing their star , we still think they can fill in as your “ d ” in certain match - ups ."
their big concern will be the field position the <UNK> offense leaves them with .

fantasy football owners beware - this is a great year to hold those <UNK> as late as possible !

"but , for how long ? the artificial <UNK> at home only makes it worse ."
not the fantasy football “ sure thing ” he once was .

"a strong secondary could be hurt by a poor pass rush , especially if <UNK> little is busy sitting in an alcohol education course instead of playing ."
"as promised , here is my take on the <UNK> west ."
"first up , we address the arizona <UNK> ."
i like the look of the 3rd year arizona <UNK> .
in the last <#> games of <UNK> he was a consistent and impressive <UNK> .
"couple this with a weak running game and new coach dennis green ’s <UNK> for <UNK> , <UNK> could easily pass the <#> yard mark ."
i make him a solid pick as a # <#> fantasy football <UNK> .
if <UNK> stays healthy you’ll probably get more fantasy football points playing stephen king .
"john <UNK> , <UNK> – had a reputation for not being able to win the big ones at michigan ."
he won’t even win the small ones this year .
"<UNK> smith , <UNK> – was <#> of the greatest . was ."
"despite being recently named as the <UNK> , don’t expect much when the hitting starts for real ."
i expect he will share a significant number of carries with <UNK> or anderson .
think he wants to show he still has it ?
think he is motivated to go out on top ?
"<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> – out for <#> - <#> weeks with a broken left leg ."
out most of the rest of the season with other talent moving ahead .
"<UNK> anderson – with <#> year old smith ahead of him , he ’s an injury away from a starting position ."
"with <UNK> behind him , he ’s a stumble away from moving back to # <#> ."
"he ’s <UNK> , but fast and hard to bring down ."
watch for <UNK> to sneak ahead of <UNK> anderson for the number <#> slot .

"yes , the birds might just have their second straight <UNK> ."

"the report is from an anonymous source , and the deal is said to <UNK> on the bears being able to come to terms with <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's general manager rick <UNK> would not confirm that any deal was <UNK> .
"the <UNK> would add a quality veteran <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> corps , and the bears would add some teeth to their pass rush ."
bears - just what <UNK> <UNK> needs ... less talent to throw to !
this trade would affect <UNK> 's fantasy football value <UNK> .
<UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> has never really gotten any respect from fantasy football .
my opinion : <#> - <#> catch season !
<UNK> was expected to carry a significant part of the load along with # <#> <UNK> brian <UNK> .

"oh , that ’s right you were a member of the bills last year ."
yes i know you were injured by those big bad <UNK> when your team lost the national championship .

"you want to see class , look at the guy you are playing behind , that ’s class ."

expect this to impact the value of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> .

"doug gabriel , <UNK> – should be the silver and black ’s # <#> <UNK> ."
keep and eye on him as he could easily find himself as the # <#> <UNK> .
i don’t expect anything from him this year .
i just listed him because i like his name .
"doug <UNK> , te – you know how doc feels about <UNK> , <UNK> those in the lower half of the <UNK> ."
his <#> <UNK> last year was especially impressive .
i would say that he has a chance to move up but its more likely that <UNK> will move down .
"if he ends up starting , he could make a decent # <#> fantasy football te ( if there is such a thing ) ."
"when ( <UNK> ) the crab isn’t kicking field goals , he ’s usually kicking someone ’s butt in a bar fight ."
"i expect a <UNK> <UNK> offense to give him more opportunities to score this year , assuming he ’s at the game and not in the <UNK> ."
defense – ok we all know that the <UNK> d got a lot more sappy during the off season .
<UNK> added the king of rude along with ted washington ( from ne ) to <UNK> their run defense .
too bad <UNK> can’t tackle with his mouth . if he ends up playing half as good
"as says he can , the <UNK> should improve significantly on defense ."
"the "" fish "" have been hit with the worst luck this year !"
"they got a double dose of bad news sunday when they learned both <UNK> <UNK> , who had emerged as the no ."
"<#> <UNK> , and backup <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> needed surgery and most likely are lost for the season ."
"in an attempt to shore - up their sinking ship , the <UNK> have reached an agreement with free - agent <UNK> antonio <UNK> ."
will you have any <UNK> on your fantasy football team ?
would you like <UNK> delivered to you fresh daily ?
"if you have ever registered at yahoo , you can have <UNK> delivered to your <UNK> page ."
"trent green , <UNK> – got his game together last year to earn top ten status ."
has connected on <#> % of his passes over the last <#> years ( vs. green ’s <#> % ) .
"the bad news , that includes all <#> total passes attempted during that period ( vs. green ’s <#> ) ."
"if green stays healthy , <UNK> will be lucky to reach double - <UNK> attempts ."
should be everyone ’s first fantasy football draft pick .
"larry johnson , <UNK> – fighting with <UNK> <UNK> for the opportunity to backup <UNK> ."
as long as priest is healthy neither <#> will be worth anything .
"<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> – fighting with larry johnson for the opportunity to backup <UNK> ."
as long as priest is healthy neither <#> will be worth anything .
<UNK> – eddie has been pretty consistent the last <#> years .
his <#> <UNK> ranked only <UNK> among all <UNK> last year .
add this to his current wrist injury and eddie is a # <#> fantasy football <UNK> at best .
"<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> – <#> is an important number for the kc <UNK> ."
"not only did <UNK> earn a <UNK> ranking , <UNK> <UNK> <#> more ( <UNK> in receiving yards and <UNK> in <UNK> ) ."
my <UNK> is to draft him to fill the <UNK> slot on your team .
"<UNK> hall , <UNK> – burned a lot of fantasy football owners last year who <UNK> kick return abilities with receiving potential ."
"depending on how the current <UNK> injury situation <UNK> he might get more touches , but don’t count on it ."
"marc <UNK> , <UNK> – had an <#> <UNK> <#> and was listed as the “ super <UNK> ” for <#> by many fantasy football <UNK> ."
we give him our “ <UNK> ” award for the fastest sinking career .
"fast , unlike most of the rest of the kc receiving corps ."
<UNK> could work his way into the top <#> ( or <#> ) as the season <UNK> .
"tony <UNK> , te – this tony award winner should be everyone ’s first choice for your fantasy football te slot ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , k – if <UNK> anderson married johnny <UNK> would he be <UNK> <UNK> ?"
( disclaimer : no t. <UNK> - type <UNK> being made ) a great <UNK> with not so great range anymore .
he ’s still good enough to be ranked as a solid backup fantasy football <UNK> .
kc defense – another example of doc ’s rule # <#> .
real season value and fantasy football value frequently have no <UNK> to each other .
"last year kc ’s d was below average , ranking <UNK> out of <#> , yet they put up great fantasy football numbers ."
a good part of this was due to <UNK> hall ’s kick returns .
"with teams kicking away from <UNK> more and more , the chief ’s d might not put up similar numbers this year ."
i would rank them a medium # <#> defense .
"we now move on to the <UNK> west and the denver <UNK> jake <UNK> , <UNK> –"
jake had probably his best year ever this past season .
"while <UNK> will probably put up decent numbers , i don’t expect anything spectacular ."
last year his passing was used primarily to keep the opposing d ’s honest for clinton <UNK> .
"but <UNK> is gone , as are shannon <UNK> and ed <UNK> ."
what ’s left isn’t much for an average <UNK> .
– you would be better off <UNK> the late danny thomas on your fantasy football <UNK> .
i expect <UNK> to win the starting job over <UNK> <UNK> bell .
"<UNK> will likely do a good job , but lacks the power to reach the end zone on those goal line sets ."
expect mike anderson to carry most of that load .
"as such , <UNK> will probably be worth more in <UNK> <UNK> ."
don’t be surprised if bell <UNK> ahead of him by mid season .
"<UNK> bell , <UNK> – tons of raw talent and most likely the <UNK> ’s <UNK> of the future ."
"given denver ’s defense , their offense probably won’t have to do a lot to win games ."
expect denver to bring him along at a moderate pace .
bell could be an excellent mid - season <UNK> by the <UNK> fantasy football owner .
"<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> – about the only thing required for <UNK> ’s career this year is a <UNK> ."
smith will soon be old enough to star in the next “ <UNK> ” movie .
he probably is a decent fantasy football # <#> <UNK> .
"<UNK> has a lot of talent , and he might have a great year - if only it was not <UNK> throwing the ball to him ."
get him as a low # <#> or high # <#> fantasy football <UNK> .
don’t think about adrian until mid - season .
"<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> – has all the tools ."
keep an eye on him as a possible mid - season fantasy football addition .
"<UNK> <UNK> , te – <UNK> likes to go to the te position ."
"last year shannon <UNK> was second only to tony <UNK> in number of catches , receiving yards and <UNK> ."
te – “ come and listen to my story ‘ bout a man <UNK> ”
"well <UNK> , those of you who think you are going to strike oil with ole <UNK> better take a dip in the cement pond ."
i think <UNK> <UNK> will catch more passes .
"jason <UNK> , k – top <#> on just about every list ."
"in the <UNK> air at mile high , he can probably keep his range up until he ’s as old as <UNK> smith ."
"still , he will consistently get you points and is a solid fantasy football # <#> <UNK> pick ."
"denver defense - already <#> of the best , the addition of john <UNK> and <UNK> bailey only increase the fantasy football value of this d"

bi has become this idea of some relatively well defined set of data answering some relatively well defined set of questions .
and the best model to do that with is the <UNK> model .
these are questions which no - <#> could have reasonably known at the time of <UNK> the <UNK> .
a legislation change in australia with respect to tax treatment of retirement funds caused a lot of confusion .
"they prepared a request for the biggest single marketing exercise the <#> year old company had ever <UNK> , presented it to the board and got the approval ."
hundreds and hundreds of people were involved in this campaign .
the result was the company gained $ <UNK> in funds under management which is $ <UNK> profit per <UNK> .
the company went from not being present in the market segment to being the leader in the space of <#> months .
and this was only the second biggest single decision <UNK> they got out of their <UNK> .
the largest decision was worth in excess of $ <UNK> per <UNK> in profit .

"back the stuff up , why waste money <UNK> it ?"
we do it for the best reason of all in a company ... <UNK> .
just backing it up is like building a library where every book published is just put in the next available space .
"and i would hope that it is self evident that <UNK> are a valuable resource , even though we so rarely visit them ourselves nowadays ! ! !"
an archive is like a library of all the data you ever came across that you thought might be useful <#> day .
"and yes , it takes a <UNK> to say . '"
"there is huge value in the data in my company , make money out it . '"
"unfortunately , it people hear such things and think it 's a blank check to build whatever they like ."
they do n't link it to profit contribution of the company ....
<#> more .... i designed a bi environment for a large mutual insurance company .
it was sponsored by the ' director of customer vision projects ' .
we spent a year selling the company on the concept that there was value in their data and we knew how to <UNK> it .
the first question asked came from the gods <UNK>
""" we are considering de - <UNK> , tell us what the <UNK> is for your region should we do so . "" that 's decision support ."
how would i have been able to design the ' <UNK> ' model ?
"of course , after i had been asked that question i could design the model , <UNK> it and answer it ."
but by that time it is already ' too late ' .
what used to take much more skill was to archive just the right data that is likely to support such unknown questions ....
our client was able to answer within the week .
the only region in the world to be able to do so .
> > enough examples above or do you want more ? ? ?
i justify the value of these things to my clients .
"how this is actually achieved , the business could n't care less ."
we could be doing it on slide rules for all they care .
whether you or anyone else on this list agrees with me is not relevant to me .
i 'm simply sharing a little experience and knowledge .
it is just that <UNK> has specific <UNK> features to enable it to do so .
"in nearly every case , senior managers refused to use the information at all if there was even the slightest hint that it was not consistent ."
this is strange because they will use highly <UNK> information just as long as every data mart gives the same wrong information .
"my answer , over years of experience came down to , if you have <#> or more , throw then away and start again ."
i was thrown out of plenty of places for <UNK> that course of action by the way .
"during an <UNK> session , we drill down to some level of detail and then the user will see a more detailed page that is <UNK> from <UNK> database ."
here are some common sense issues : the data from the <#> <UNK> are on different <UNK> - <#> is real time and the other is daily <UNK> .
"for example , on <#> report , i have <#> orders and next report shows that i have <#> ."
the data from <UNK> database are raw and the data on data mart are transformed .
"from a business point of view , the above reports are not acceptable ."
any industry experiences on solving these types of problems ?
why must the detailed information come from an <UNK> database ?

"from the dashboard , all that 's available is the ( quite lame and out - of - date ) blogs of note and the recently updated ."
"correct me if i 'm wrong , but there does n't seem to be a main page from which <#> can search or browse categories ."
does n't that seem a little <UNK> and counter - <UNK> ?
what if i 'm looking for something that i have n't listed as <#> of my interests or favorites ?
it 's no wonder so many of the other blogs that i have looked at have posts without any comments .
here 's an interesting little bit - o - fun i stumbled across today :
"urllink <UNK> has some time - <UNK> ( i.e. , quizzes ) on her site , and i just took the <UNK> feminist quiz ."
"i do n't suck , but i 've got a ways to go ."
"anyway , i also took her geek time quiz , and apparently i am a <#> 's geek ."
"um , not quite sure what that means , but there you have it ."
"speaking of internet quizzes , i always enjoy the time i waste over at urllink <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"frankly , the site was way better when it was <UNK> , before <UNK> came along and added all the bullshit with the <UNK> ."
"i was happy with just the tests , what did they need to go and <UNK> "" <UNK> and social networking "" ? !"
i guess there just are n't enough websites for such things .
what ever ... i also came across a virtual pet <UNK> link on urllink <UNK> kitten 's blog over at urllink <UNK> .
"scroll down the sidebar to see this blog 's new <UNK> , killer , the white rabbit ."
"btw , when you click on him , he jumps !"
"<UNK> ! if you 'd like a virtual pet for your own web page , go to urllink <UNK> lab 's <UNK> centre ."
"in addition to rabbits , they have puppies , kittens , ducks , and <UNK> ."
"also dragons , "" coming soon . "" and"
"lastly , thanks to urllink <UNK> for providing "" <UNK> "" <UNK> ; i chose <#> for this site from their irish eyes collection ."
"it 's been awhile since i last used html , and most of the very little bit i had learned , i have since forgotten ."
"regardless , i did accomplish this <#> small achievement , and so thought i would give a bit of explanation for the links i have posted ."
"<UNK> station -- hopefully , this is self - <UNK> ."
"also , there really is a good and fairly extensive selection of music from all different <UNK> ."
urllink <UNK> 's <UNK> -- this is my <UNK> 's weblog .
"here you will primarily find <UNK> and political discussions , as well as <UNK> for interesting and <UNK> stuff he has come across on the ' net ."
"if you enjoy participating in <UNK> discussions , you should check it out ."
"urllink red vs. blue -- absolutely hysterical , <UNK> <UNK> using the pc game halo as its basis ."
"the guys who write , voice act , and produce this stuff are <UNK> creative <UNK> ."
i would compare the storyline and humor of red vs. blue to such professional <UNK> as family guy and south park .
<UNK> teeth <UNK> : a true web phenomenon .
urllink <UNK> <UNK> -- people submit <UNK> they find on the web to this site .
"content <UNK> widely , but a lot of stuff is there because it is funny in some way ."
"other things are not meant to be funny or weird , and are simply posted because they are interesting <UNK> ."
this is where i have discovered <#> of my <UNK> favorite files : urllink the <UNK> song and urllink the <UNK> lost episode .
"i ca n't really describe the site better , you should take some time to investigate it yourself ."
it 's fun and games for the <UNK> ( secret society of unemployed people ) in lol ( laid - off land ) !
"urllink joe cartoon -- another brilliant , creative , and funny site with loads of flash cartoons ."
"in particular , check out the stone fly series ."
"and btw , if you know of any other <UNK> sites where funny and/or unusual web entertainment can be found , please pass it on here !"
"i suspect there will be some of that here as well ( or at least the first part , ' cause"
"now , do i really need my very own personal <UNK> ?"
so i think it is somewhat comforting to know that i have an outlet to go to when such topics arise .
"i assume there will also be some of the <UNK> journal - type entries , day - to - day stuff , observations , musings , and what not ."
all of this seems pretty standard of the typical blog .
but what i 'd really like to see my blog <UNK> towards is a kind of catch - all for any writing that i 'd like to do .
the satisfaction of creating something unique is a sensation i long to <UNK> .
"and i thought that this medium may help me down that path , so here we are !"
"in closing for today , i would like to thank you for dropping by and reading my <UNK> ) ."
"please always feel free to post any of your own comments or feedback , and i hope y ou will <UNK> n to read more !"
"as i did so , i was having a dream about trains , of course , since i am planning to take <#> ."

"i jumped out of bed , heard rain begin to fall on my side of the <UNK> ran outside to smoke and enjoy it ..."
"i grabbed my umbrella ( the <UNK> <#> ) , <UNK> shaking it at the <UNK> ."
just then lightning and thunder begin to <UNK> all <UNK>
"i was daring it to strike me , or , i was <UNK> it from striking everything else ."
"i was being a <UNK> ( dog <UNK> , people <UNK> ! ) so that every other <UNK> <UNK> could fail to be struck , as such . but"
"then of course i got really <UNK> and was like , uh , k sorry about that , gods ."
sorry about all that daring you to strike me <UNK> business !
i had my <UNK> from yesterday tied to the umbrella <UNK> and
", my rubber ( are they rubber ? ) sandals ."
"on , i assured my mother when she began to question my <UNK> <UNK> ."
"my parents , quite <UNK> , think i am insane ."
! at least it got struck and none of ours .
the neighbors across the street were worried about it and pulled their suv 's back into the garage to see what happened .
"they have a very large garage and many vehicles , i suppose ."
"i am not going to go into any more details than this , suffice to say that it was a good show ."
"i got a <UNK> pix of the tree in <UNK> and , a piece of it 's fallen <UNK> ."
"then there were the <UNK> opening <UNK> , which my father thinks are <UNK> but i was <UNK> interested to see how they would be done ."
"fish bowl <UNK> , chocolate cake on a humid day ."
"rotting <UNK> , death be not proud ... and at least the <UNK> have arrived or , some of their <UNK> are about ."
"i had forgotten all about it being <UNK> the 13th , too !"
"it seems lucky to me , but i am weird ."
"jk , i am <UNK> ' thee peace , as it <UNK> just not a boring <#> !"
"( so , lets call it the <UNK> <UNK> , for the moment ... k ? )"
"urllink <UNK> wee hee , woo hoo , haha love - <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>"
"head ache , heart ache , ache of <UNK> ..."
i finally had t <UNK> # <#> <UNK> !
"woo hoo , that was so much easier and cheaper than i had imagined ."
"i called on t , whose name should not be said ."
"usually i avoid doing this as he can bring misery but , we so desperately needed any strike from above here , anything to bring rain !"
"suffice to say that , he is known to take the form of <UNK> showers , lightning or thunder , and <UNK> <UNK> ( to some ) consequences ."
"his name should not be said <#> times at <#> sitting , like <UNK> , or <UNK> , if you like modern urban legend <UNK> ."
"his tales usually involve some dispute over the love of a local female who he <UNK> away from the lover she ca n't be with , etc . )"
"( hail thunder , <#> of air , <UNK> thinking ..."
"then afterwards , we stopped by my aunt 's house to feed her cat and found a desert <UNK> ."
"i mean , a large <#> , like <#> - <#> feet <UNK> ."
""" mom , they can hear these things coming ."
"what is it that you like about them anyway ? """
many people do n't know that flash <UNK> are a <UNK> in the <UNK> '
"hahahaha yes , we had been <UNK> the differences between <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ..."
i always get all those da - s <UNK> .
"i have , er , had this <UNK> <UNK> uh ..."
and of course while i was trying to deal with all that i got out of the frame and forgot what i was doing !
"anyone know whatever happened to <UNK> , whatever , that guy who was blogging from iraq at the <UNK> of the war last year ?"
"anyone else remember <UNK> , and how that was all <#> big joke ?"
"i am an <UNK> , and thus i must be not - a <UNK> i am like <UNK> i guess : i know nothing ! <UNK>"
"i the meantime , until i can think of what to do next , please visit the following links , of some bands i * may * know of ."
"i will have a more <UNK> list , later ."
we are having <UNK> issues here of late ...
i doubt i 'll ever leave this valley alive ... but at least they may name it <UNK> someday .

he has a face that only a mother could love .

jamie johnson aka jamie - <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jim johnson <UNK> ( triple j )
( certainly not “ he is a <UNK> ” – that has been said on many occasions ! ) .
in the <UNK> of the <UNK> he is a legend in <UNK> .
"but it is not just good looks , wit , charm and intelligence that he lacks ."
there are many other qualities that should be shared with the <UNK> this man can produce an <UNK> <UNK> of the dead homosexual singer <UNK> mercury .

a quick <UNK> of triple j. for a more extensive background you will see much more of him throughout the site .
it was once said about a young man that he was a credit to his mother .
well time and place wait for no man and that young gentleman is a fully grown .
"as with all things , expansion is key , and this is no exception ."
"credibility ....... its an issue , but in this he is not alone ."
"<#> other individuals stand in his way , <#> men who on their day all have had certain credibility issues ."
i like chinese is a <UNK> to those boys .
"its a league , but not <#> you want to win ."
"when i first heard this song , i thought that is my theme song ."
can you love me when i am not who i normally am ?
"those days when you are <UNK> or just down , will you still love me or do i always have to be the happy <#> ?"
do you love me or the way i am when all is right with the world ?
"last year at the john mayer concert , he talked about this song ."
he said most people saw it as lovers and he meant it as friends .
"it is about friendship , how you like your friend no matter what the surrounding circumstances ."
suppose i said i am on my best behavior and there are time i lose my worried mind ?
would you want me when i 'm not myself ?
wait it out while i am someone else ?
suppose i said colors change for no good reason and words will go from poetry to <UNK> <UNK> you want me when i 'm not myself ?
wait it out while i am someone else ?
i always do for you suppose i said you 're my saving grace
"this song always <UNK> to me as a love song about a relationship that was n't ever going to last forever , because of circumstances it just wo n't ."
i recently attend a john mayer concert where he explained that this song was about life .
"look at where you are , this is where you are ."
"it wo n't last forever , it just ca n't , it 's not supposed to ."
enjoy life where you are right now because things will always change .
did i sail through or drop my <UNK> down ?
was anything enough to kiss the ground and say i 'm here now ?
and she is here now so much wasted in the afternoon so much sacred in the month of june how ' bout you ?
it has been <#> years since all of that mess happened .
it was such a horrible time in my life .
<UNK> about all of the things that i had done .
"i has <UNK> my parents , my husband , my family ."
i was the horrible person and they were all victims .
"i was the lucky <#> who got to say , "" look what a fucked up life we have all been leading ."
""" i pointed fingers and blamed all the men in my life ."
"my dad , because he was n't there for me as a young girl growing up trying to figure out how to love a man ."
"if you truly felt that way , would n't you have fought and refused to pay for anything or something ?"
"you could n't do that , though , because your childhood was such a mess ."
"you did n't know how to love my mother , that 's why you <#> are n't married anymore and you are on your third marriage ."
"then i blamed my <UNK> , who never did anything wrong to me in his life ."
it was in his death that i felt he had failed me .
that is the time in my life where i was discovering myself and my sexuality .
i needed him there to show me that love that my dad could n't show me .
"i could n't even cry , although i knew i should be , i wanted to , but i did n't know how to ."
he got me all messed up and had me for <#> years and nothing was ever fixed .
"not necessarily , but to a point , i think that he could have made it better , somehow ."
he just <UNK> what my dad had taught me .
"that 's why i stayed with him , that 's why i married him , that 's why i was afraid to leave ."
it was what i knew my whole life .
"in the end , i had to realized that i had given up on the marriage some <#> years before ."
i do n't want to have to say i am divorced .
that means failure and i hate that i feel that i have failed at most everything in my life .
i had kids to focus on and that 's what i would do .
"i honestly did n't even care if he had an affair , it would take that sexual pressure off of me ."
then there came the days that i just wished that <#> of us would die that day .
"i did n't care who it was , but that was the only way out , or so i thought ."
i would not ever hurt myself so that they kids would see me or that anyone would know that i had done that on purpose .
i remember <#> time my mom told me about a woman who had taken a pain pill or something and had some wine and died in her sleep .
"i was on medication , i tried not exactly to <UNK> , but like an <UNK> mix of alcohol and meds ."
"it was something to think about , never worked though ."
"here we are , mid - august , <#> ."
i have a friend who is leaving her husband for a man she met on the internet in a chat room .
i was n't allowed to download that type of thing because it would mess up the computer .
my husband takes the <#> older children away for the weekend to fish on his new fishing boat .
"i am left alone with the "" baby "" , all alone ."
i want to know what all the fuss is about and i am going to go against the leader of our party and just do it .
"after i get it downloaded , i watch for anything weird to happen to the computer ."
i do n't want to have to explain anything .
i figure i will see it is nothing and just take it off later .
i go into a chat room and just start talking and getting talked to . out of no where
sometimes so many i ca n't talk to them all .
"these are all guys , young guys , looking for sex ."
"well , until they start asking me what i look like , how much i weight , am i married , all that stuff ."
i make up some story about how i want to look and just play along .
but i find i have an incredible imagination and am a quick <UNK> .
"i am telling them i am participating , but i am actually not , i am typing too fast , do n't they notice that ?"
"at <#> point , i talk to this <#> year old from massachusetts ."
"i say to him , i am old enough to be your mother ."
"i said , no i do and i am not talking to you ."
"i did , however , seem to remember his screen name - <UNK> ."
"i did n't sleep in my bed though , i slept on the couch close to the computer ."
i never stay up that late and only slept like <#> hour .
i woke up so alive that i just had to get back on line .
"it was like <UNK> , i guess , never done it , but it was like a drug you just ca n't stop ."
"around noon that day , <UNK> instant <UNK> me again ."
i think what i was feeling was a wanting from another male .
i tried to justify this by saying i could have control over myself .
he was <#> after all and i was sure that was n't legal to even talk to him like this on line .
"long story short , i have an internet affair with this boy for <#> weeks ."
we talked on line a lot and on the phone some .
i was the most turned on i had been in years .
"in fact , i would say i had n't felt that way since i was a teenager ."
"my husband loved it , but did n't know what to do with me ."
"there were other men i talked to , most older or my age ."
then he found out and all hell broke loose .
this part is too hard to talk about but it was the <UNK> of our marriage .
it was the beginning of the end for us .
"he was the victim , i was the <UNK> ."
i had ruined anything good that could be <UNK> .
the journey to the end would last another <#> years .
"i am a nice girl , trying to do the right thing ."
how did i end up a single mother trying to <UNK> her self esteem and self worth and find happiness in life ?
"i can tell you this , i am so much better off than i was <#> months ago when i decided to call it <UNK> ."
"yes , i gave up on the whole idea of my marriage ever being anything worth talking about , in a good way ."
"many would say , too , that i gave up on god fixing what i saw as <UNK> ."
"whatever about that , i know he knew where i was coming from and i will deal with him later on that ."
"i am not looking for sympathy , mind you , i am just trying to understand where i went wrong"
"now , do n't tell me i did n't do anything , it may have just been him ."
i know i came into the marriage with baggage from my parents and so did he .
neither <#> of us had good roll models on how to be happily married .
"but , we were "" christians "" and god brought us together and so he would work everything out , right ?"
"we had to do something too and neither <#> of us wanted to put forth the effort at the same time , which just made it incredibly difficult ."
"we went to all kinds of marriage <UNK> , read books ."
it seemed that both sets of parents were desperately trying to help up fix what was wrong by sending us places on how to and giving us books .
"well , first off , someone actually has to be scared enough to try ."
i had <#> small children to take care of and soon another <#> on the way .
"i <UNK> and took care , or was supposed to , of things around the house ."
"there was no way i was going to sit down at nap time and read a "" how to fix your marriage "" book ."
i wanted to read about someone else 's romance .
"he was n't about to crack the cover of anything but something about music , fishing or golf , and that was only a magazine ."
why would i do something he was n't willing to put equal time into .
"oh , except that his wife would n't willingly and <UNK> have sex with him ."
i had too many to count but was so overwhelmed that i could n't even think straight enough to get them on paper enough to make sense .
"i was , <#> years into a marriage and realized i did n't want to put any more effort into loving this man ."
it hurt too bad and i was giving up .
i would stay married because it was all i knew .
"i did n't have good job history , i was a stay at home mom ."
i knew i could n't support myself and there would n't be much child support .
i did n't know <UNK> to do but make nice and just try to get along .
"we had good times , do n't get me wrong ."
i tried so hard to make light of the tough things that it just wore me completely out .
"if i was n't happy , he would get worried and it would just be worse ."
so i did n't get unhappy around him too much .
"ok , so here i am approaching the <#> year anniversary of the day i filed for divorce ."
"there seems to be an anniversary for everything , you know ."
why not <#> for the day you decided to be alive and free instead of <UNK> and empty ?
i think back where i was <#> year ago and i get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach .
i was in total despair and hopeless to the point of suicide .
"although , at this stage i was <UNK> , too ."
"i had just completed an <UNK> , intense <UNK> program ."
i was there because the marriage counselor had seen where i was emotionally and said i should probably check into <UNK> treatment for a couple of weeks .
"to my dismay , i was n't suicidal enough !"
"i wanted to scream , give me a knife and i will <UNK> my wrists right now , just do n't make me go home to him ."
please do n't make me have to live that life another day .
"the first day was not too bad , the first week was just tough ."
i just sat back and listened to what the other people in the room had going on .
"i also judged many of them , thinking they were all just pissy <UNK> trying to get out of work or something ."
"i wanted to scream , come live my life !"
you people do n't have any idea what misery is .
"my husband had an affair too , so did i. so what , get over it and get on with it ."
i had input only when i was asked by the counselor leading the group .
"i would often look at her and wonder , what is your home life like ?"
how do you deal with your husband and children ?
<#> day i was walking down the hall and got pulled into a room .
"when i saw who had done it , i just hugged her ."
she was a counselor there and had seen my name in the staff meeting <#> day .
i think that was the day i decided to make a change in my approach at home .
"i decided to go home and not be passive or aggressive , but to be <UNK> ."
"if i took anything from <UNK> , it was that i had been <UNK> way too long ."
"let me just say , that did n't go over too well ."
"ok , so i spent <#> weeks and <#> extra day in <UNK> ."
but when my time was up i was so ready to go home .
"i remember <UNK> when my group counselor pulled me aside for my <UNK> meeting , she asked me what changes i was going to make at home ."
"she asked , too , if i was going to work on my marriage ."
"i looked her straight in the face and said , i am going to be much more <UNK> and not get pushed around any more and"
"no , most definitely no , i am not going to work on my marriage ."
"now , it took me a while to actually get the nerve and money to file , but i did it ."
i wanted this and i was going for it .
"<#> things , i was on <#> different <UNK> for depression and i drank a lot ."
"the medication helped me think clearly , the drinking helped me deal with my husband ."
"it all came crashing down , though , like i knew it would ."
so -- let 's discuss the dream i had this morning .
"should i contact <UNK> friday 's boy , and tell him about the dream i had ? ?"
"i 'm walking through a college campus union , when i come across him ."
"a storm is <UNK> , so i <UNK> go -- this is when he offers to show me how to fly a car in a hurricane ."
"it goes well , and when we "" land , "" we 're at the mall ."
"i decide to take a shower there , so i can try out the products ."
"i take so long to shower , that he has the time to grow a <UNK> and then take a nap ."
b got a free drink at smith 's ! ! !
"maybe they 'll give us <#> this time next year , too ."
was listening to the iron city <UNK> this morning .
the best band from pittsburgh that nobody 's heard of .
"they got a mention at urllink ol ' <UNK> 's blog , and i had the tape in the car ...."
"specifically , the album urllink have a good time but get out alive ."
"these guys were a lot of fun , not quite "" top shelf "" ."
"have a good time is sort of a pittsburgh version of the who 's <UNK> , and did <UNK> a minor hit "" <UNK> "" ."
i remember playing it over and over after breaking up with a very special woman back in college .
.... of course she and i have been married <UNK> years now ...
".... regardless , looking at <UNK> , it does n't look like there 's any <UNK> records currently available on cd ."
guess i need to figure out that urllink <UNK> software i got recently ! !
"last summer , i took my son ( then <#> years old ) to the urllink <UNK> for the first time ."
"i decided that after living in the area for ( then ) <#> years , it was about time i took a <UNK> of the thing ."
it 's actually just a part ( though not exactly a small part ) of the urllink jefferson national expansion memorial .
"if you 're ever in town , take the time to see the movie on how they built the <UNK> ."
but that 's the engineer in me talking again !
"here 's a quick scan of a <UNK> showing myself , in my prime , along with friends including urllink ol ' <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ! !"
"whatever ... .... "" got little curled up <UNK> all over my clothes """
he loves the big bounce house and all of his friends .
"we had a large <UNK> full of ribs , <UNK> and wings ."
there was even a big bon fire to end the night . just a good day overall to sit and chat with the neighbors .
i do believe the hit for <UNK> was the <UNK> cookies and the <UNK> .
"<UNK> is finally understanding that you can ride a bike , not just push it ."
"<UNK> plays with her new bike , thanks grandma <UNK> !"
"ok , so today besides being friday the 13th , is also my mom 's birthday ."
"so all i will say is "" i love you and happy birthday ! """
i talked to <UNK> today and he is having a great time .
he has made some new friends at the trailer next to him that shares his love of <UNK> .
"we started off going to the bank and were a little frustrated that the drive up windows were closed , so we <UNK> inside ."
only to find out that it is customer service week at bank <#> ( with the drive through closed ?
so we made our deposit and the <UNK> talked me into filling out this new disney charge application in which you earn money towards disney dream rewards .
not to bad of luck for friday the 13th ! !
urllink i took these photos yesterday so i would have some new ones for you all to see .
i did come across an older <#> that is too special not to share .
<UNK> left today to go camping with my mom for a little over a week .
<UNK> and i enjoyed some quiet around the house today and ran some errands .
<UNK> and i will be visiting <UNK> next week some time to spend the night .
my mom and dad just got a new 5th wheel and there is so much room !
"( though truly , i do n't think you could call it camping when the trailer has a huge kitchen , central vacuum and even a <UNK> ."
i just want to say thank you to everyone who made <UNK> 's birthday special .
she had a blast and received some great gifts .
"ok , i am going to give this a try ."
"i really enjoy "" checking "" in on the <UNK> family , so i thought maybe we would give it a try ."
so please hang in there with me while i work this out .
she can stand ! and <UNK> to stand instead of sit .
she likes to see how long she can stand ( well over <#> min . ) and when she finally falls she expects you and everyone else to clap .
this will be a new treat for <UNK> tomorrow .
"today we went to a 1st birthday party for samantha , she is the daughter of a college friend of mine , <UNK> and her husband mike ."
( we wo n't tell <UNK> he missed it . )
we only have <#> more week left until school starts .
"that means <UNK> , <UNK> and i all head off to classes ."
the summer really seems short when you are not working !
"yes , we are excited , can you tell ?"
"i do talk to him a couple times a day if he is n't "" to busy "" ."
( you know how the life of a <#> year can be ! )
he likes to play the guessing game at night .
that is were i have to guess what pajamas he has on .
we are also into the countdown of when kindergarten starts ... august 30th .
"i am not really that torn up about it , i think because he has already been away at <UNK> and daycare ."

"everyone was really nice at each administration office , but i think it was because i had <UNK> with me ."
"<#> to pick up papers off the floor and <#> just because she was "" so darn cute ."
"<UNK> and i are feeling much better , scott on the <UNK> ( being a man ) takes a little longer to heal ."
"tonight i headed out to <UNK> and got <UNK> a spiderman backpack for school , he will think he is hot stuff !"
i ca n't wait for him to see it .
urllink i just wanted to share a picture of my parent 's new trailer .
meet <UNK> urllink <UNK> is <#> of my mom 's rescue dogs .
"she is a german wire hair <UNK> , i believe ."
this dog has the biggest heart and is super <UNK> .
"i like to joke that when you talk to her , she looks at you like you are speaking a foreign language ."
my parents saved her because she was a handful and had been through a couple of owners .
she even climbed a fence to escape from her previous owners .
"she is smart enough to stay at my parents though , because she is in <UNK> paradise ."
<#> of the <UNK> things is she thinks she is a <UNK> .
she loves to sit on your shoulder when you are sitting down .
"she may be funny , but we love her ."
urllink these are some pictures i just got developed .
<UNK> loves to ham it up for the camera and <UNK> thinks she is silly .
today was <#> of those days that i could nothing seemed to go right .
i am glad to see it is almost over ... maybe tomorrow will be better .
"scott , <UNK> and i all have <UNK> right now , so you can imagine how fun that is ."
"<#> good thing is at least <UNK> is still camping so he is free of the "" sick "" house right now ."

too long it has been thank - you for <UNK> for bringing unity consciousness at times of deep distress .
"your golden glow filled my being <UNK> a peace of light and love removing in it ’s wake tears , confusion , <UNK> ."
for you are always close waiting to hold me for holding is the only thing to comfort this <UNK> i have become .
"all these you give to me i remember when you left me here you said never get attached however , holding lightly with love your only gift ."
now i also understand i am to have none with me forever just different ones in passing until work with each is done .
"ahhhh , yet it is so hard for deeply do i love these souls each unique inner light <UNK> to be seen ."
"jo , summer <#> , written for my <UNK>"
feel free to wander <UNK> am just learning on here
"well , it 's fun anyhow , into <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK>"
and when you were not there and i no longer here within my being you stayed the piece u gave so free .
finding a piece of yourself you had long ago <UNK> when did you do this <UNK> ?
<UNK> wonder yes i said yes of course i remember you how could i not ?
"i believe we are all <#> and the same being - all rocks , trees , creatures , stars , air , water , the universe itself is us ."
i believe that love <UNK> all and it is the only true and real thing in all the universe .
i believe that all things work towards good for those who are of the light and follow the path .
"i believe that when we stop and ask and then listen , the answer will always be given ."
"i believe that with regard to time , the only moment that really matters is now - this very second we are in now ."
finding a piece of yourself you had long ago <UNK> when did you do this <UNK> ?
<UNK> wonder yes i said yes of course i remember you how could i not ?
"your planet <UNK> , is a <UNK> <UNK> amongst all in the universe ."
the colours you see are only the reflections of your own inner beauty . where it all went wrong the creator does not know .
you now must have the realization that just as you are <UNK> so too is the creator .
"alas , in the final dying twilight of the history of your most precious <UNK> <UNK> the creator <UNK> with you ."
we know not the fears the greed the all <UNK> inner emptiness you seek to fill .
we are here now to tell you that the things without in your <UNK> garden will not fill your need .
to fill your aching emptiness you must access the <UNK> to elsewhere from within .
only then will you understand and finally see for you will be so filled with that which will be all to you .
as long as you continue to seek without you will create a deeper and deeper emptiness and <UNK> will continue to die her slow <UNK> death .
"the waters , resources , beings of <UNK> will not fill you ."
they will be bring <UNK> and <UNK> to your inner being .
they were meant as a <UNK> to sense with your <#> senses while your sixth sense served your primary needs .
things have been horribly <UNK> on this planet <UNK> creator does not know where the defining moment took place .
the sixth sense became the <UNK> while you fully <UNK> and <UNK> the things your remaining <#> senses <UNK> with .
the <#> senses which you most often use are your <UNK> and most <UNK> . for always when they are filled the need will become greater .
the creator is not perfect as <UNK> by yourselves .
we ask that you observe this precious <UNK> <#> last time .
we ask that you see it is within you to take care of this precious <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> her not and realize her <UNK> as she cries out to you for an end to the madness .
"for god ’s will to be done , on earth , as it is in heaven ."
i am moving through the twilight skies <UNK> my energy <UNK> towards the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lies my waiting city .
it ’s been awhile i’ve been away far too many for <#> small soul to bare .
finally my assignment finished the <UNK> of my home - <UNK> arriving none - too - soon .
after so long on the 3d planet of earth and water beings of emotions far too confusing for this <#> to understand ?
oh how i long for you my distant crystal - blue <UNK> planet you are a <UNK> light years away and even more <UNK> .
the beings of <UNK> are pure light energy pure <UNK> is no night - day in <UNK> .
the reason being is the atmosphere of <UNK> is very <UNK> and does not allow the transmission of <UNK> light energy .
there are no plant forms on <UNK> in the sense of earth plants .
in fact there are no animal forms <UNK> is only energy .
the beings of <UNK> are loose energy <UNK> you the earth being they would appear as ‘
they have no <UNK> is not necessary on <UNK> for there is no <UNK> transformation .
<UNK> the <UNK> will choose to visit here on earth plane .
"when <UNK> based human feelings of anger , fear and jealousy are introduced into the <UNK> being the being becomes somewhat confused having nothing to <UNK> these emotions against ."
the <UNK> does not understand why all beings here on earth plane can not feel eternal love for <#> another .
all thought s and emotions from without freely enter the <UNK> physical form .
this is why often <UNK> are private shy individuals .
"they are , however extremely loving and kind seeking only to bring peace and harmony to all situations for this is how it is in their home <UNK> ."
they consistently try to re - create home here on this plane .
<UNK> in the past . .... in paris <#>
been busy copying some of my <UNK> pics into the new laptop .
"( the laptop is doing great * so far * by the way , no more of those scary symptoms !"
"ohh , that reminds me too , to ask <UNK> a favor to scan our other holiday <UNK> ..."
"anyways , i got so <UNK> up seeing our paris trip <#> years ago , <UNK> 's gift to me for visiting him in nl ."
i guess that was kind of romantic at that time since i did n't get any flowers ! ! !
"you know dutch - men , they fall behind the romance department but this was indeed plus points !"
<UNK> metro station a <UNK> shot ! did n't expect <UNK> will flash away !
"i love the bright yellow color of the underground channel , kind of warm but sexy ."
cafe in <UNK> located on the same hill where <UNK> <UNK> church is sitting .
<UNK> and i were kind of arguing if we would like to have a <UNK> in this cafe .
"so when we got the bill , we asked the waiter to do it !"
see the <UNK> tower on top of my head .
the lights go <UNK> for several minutes every hour .
"beautiful , it looks like an <UNK> christmas tree at night !"
haha ! best place to view it from <UNK> would be in <UNK> building .
"that place was actually charming but heck , it was too small , even for me !"
<UNK> <UNK> stairs going down to the street from the church ...
can you imagine going up and down with my heels ! ?
"march weather was n't that great too , hence my umbrella !"
"i tell you , the <UNK> in this square should be sent to court for <UNK> !"
they behave in fact like <UNK> <UNK> begging to paint or make a sketch of you for a fee .
"<UNK> , i could n't pass the opportunity not <UNK> in the square with these talented species and their art as my <UNK> !"
the gothic <UNK> the history of <UNK> began where the church stands today .
"at the beginning of our era , the romans built a fort here , the remains of which still lie under the <UNK> today ."
the first saint martin ’s church was built on this location in the 7th century .
from roman to gothic the <UNK> of the current church dates <UNK> start of the 11th century .
some <UNK> of this roman saint martin ’s <UNK> can be seen in the garden beside the <UNK> .
"in <#> , a huge fire swept through the city and badly damaged the roman <UNK> ."
"a new <UNK> style , gothic , was chosen for <UNK> the church ."
"construction of this gothic saint martin ’s church began in <#> , when bishop <UNK> van <UNK> laid the first stone ."
"bit by bit , the originally roman <UNK> was replaced ."
urllink the dom in <UNK> <#> - bishop <UNK> van <UNK> laid the first stone of the gothic <UNK> .
<#> - construction of the tower began .
<#> - tower and church were connected .
<#> - construction of the <UNK> ended . <#> august <#> - <UNK> was <UNK> by a tornado .
"<#> - the <UNK> was finally cleared away , the current <UNK> was created ."
<#> to <#> - the reception building in front of the <UNK> tower was built .
"saturday is shopping day at our favorite cheap - y grocery store , urllink <UNK> ."
he ’s <UNK> ; he is fond of <UNK> defined subjects that he <UNK> on .
the urllink <UNK> ( consumer organization ) have rated them as the # <#> supermarket with the <UNK> prices in the whole of nl .
the low - cost german urllink <UNK> and urllink <UNK> ranked next .
"its just <#> minutes bike ride from where we live , which makes it very convenient for us ."
i kind of liked it since it gives my legs the needed exercise for the weekend .
i have a <UNK> <UNK> ( bike bag ) that hangs at the back of my bike .
"sister in law gave this to me , very useful when we go shopping ."
<UNK> .... did i just say we shop with our bikes ?
- i myself still ca n't get over the idea .
", i thought biking is akin to playing .... but not here in nl !"
"if you do n't have a bike , then you don’t live in nl ."
later i will edit this entry and post a <UNK> of a dutch going shopping with this <UNK> bike .
studies here show that a dutch person has on average <#> bikes .
"the 1st bike is a “ beat down bike ” , for practical reasons against bike - <UNK> , the country ’s # <#> crime ."
these bikes are the ones you <UNK> <UNK> when crossing the streets in the <UNK> .
you actually hear the <UNK> subjects from a distance .
they make their arrival known so that gives you <UNK> time to jump to the <UNK> !
"the 2nd bike , a “ nice good priced bike ” , for personal <UNK> and must by all means never be <UNK> from the owner ."
"talk about being <UNK> ! and a reminder , you are stupid if you leave it in a non - paid <UNK> <UNK> ( bike parking ) !"
"great , i have finished my bike rant and now i will go shopping :-)"
the laptop is again working ok but in a <UNK> mode .
"i simply am puzzled in <UNK> , why a "" brand new laptop "" is doing <UNK> acts on me ."
"i trust his judgment , he is the <UNK> ."
"i am already sold out to just re - install everything , start fresh , start <UNK> even if <UNK> is <UNK> ."
work is slow this month but i got <#> orders today from <UNK> and pacific internet .
the fat bitch is getting married later in the afternoon .
"good <UNK> ... at least for the time - being , hehe . on to the <UNK> ..."
i am <UNK> in anger towards the <UNK> urllink microsoft ! my urllink
hp laptop is barely <#> weeks old and is already suffering from <UNK> - memory dump .
"the processor <UNK> stop <UNK> forever , all because of the pathetic microsoft ie eating up the system ."
"we have done the <UNK> countless times , still it remains the same , <UNK> ."
"when he deleted the ie in the <UNK> , the system quickly went back to normal ."
the hardware is nothing if there is no software !
"given the chance , i would kick bill <UNK> for <UNK> the desktop software consumer market ."
"i hope tonight the laptop will do some miracles ... if not , i am <UNK> to re - install that <UNK> microsoft xp pro ! :-("
yesterday <UNK> and i went to a dutch church wedding of his aunt .
"the couple is in their late <#> ’s and have lived together for quite some <UNK> that when they announced the wedding , everyone in the family was surprised !"
the <UNK> <UNK> how i describe as “ a <UNK> liberal but socialist country ” .
<UNK> relationships have become a trend in the 20th century offering the same <UNK> and <UNK> as any marriage <UNK> .
in fact if you ask a dutch if he/she would like to marry ?
* eyebrows raised * that ’s just expenses ” !
"for a dutch , there is <UNK> no distinction between being married and living together ."
"nicholas church ) in <UNK> , <UNK> slightly before <#> pm and a <UNK> crowd was already gathered outside ."
"the usual <#> kisses went flying in the air and embarrassing enough , some i have no clue who i kissed !"
the whole church wedding came as a seal of revelation to me .
"the beautiful <UNK> church stood there void of any <UNK> , of any hint of <UNK> <UNK> ."
"the bride was dressed in an <UNK> <UNK> , no wedding dress but a white <UNK> suit !"
the groom was not waiting in the altar but instead the couple together with the priest went down the <UNK> to the altar .
"the <UNK> went on to focus of their past lives , both having met in a support group for having lost a loved <#> ."
<#> can only imagine from <UNK> how loss can <UNK> into gain .
<UNK> followed in an english pub in <UNK> – a striking town in the south of <UNK> full of these <UNK> <UNK> draw - up dutch bridges .
"<UNK> and i have been here in the past , <UNK> through ."
"i had white wine , peanuts and some sort of italian <UNK> with <UNK> and cheese ."
"the bad news , we are not part of that group , <UNK> hahaha !"
"the invited elite are only the direct family members , and since <UNK> is a nephew - 2nd generation , so is he <UNK> ."
i would even bet my <UNK> <#> if there was a wedding cake that evening !
* <UNK> * it went to the air !
"<UNK> i am at work by the way , hehe ."
""" mondays "" they say is the least exciting day of the week , perhaps the angels above were <UNK> because <UNK> today is absolutely an <UNK> monday !"
"my superior , the sales director gave me the go signal ( approved by upper management ) for our philippines business trip !"
"so the next days , in fact the whole week , i will be <UNK> <UNK> my time in <UNK> our trip agenda ."
i desperately need to <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> - yup per client with at least a <#> month to <#> year <UNK> plan on total sales and profit .
"am pretty sure , like in most corporate reality drama - these wolves will run after you , in this case me ."
they will be behind my back at all times after having invested much ( * <UNK> raised * ) just like a <UNK> wolf <UNK> watching the sheep ....
yes this will happen after the business trip ! ! !
"the wolves want results , results , results ."
<UNK> question ? a not - so friendly reminder --- a wolf can easily <UNK> a sheep for lunch !
uh - oh .... i do n't think i would taste good for a lunch snack ?
what the heck is going on with this bloody blogger ?
i could n't get in for the freaking * nth time ! and
"once i did , the whole window flew out of my keyboard ? !"
i have typed in more than a <#> words and boom * <UNK> % $ ! in a snap
"perhaps next time , i will <UNK> the matter ."
"for now , we can dwell on the idea that <UNK> is a good pick !"
"there is reason in fact to celebrate ... if not because of this <UNK> technology , <UNK> and i would n't have crossed our paths !"
"i guess that is what real "" love "" can do , <UNK> you !"
i have several forums that i am a member of .
"oh yeah i forgot , the forever friendly networking urllink friendster and this addictive urllink blogger ."
"to add , i have urllink <UNK> and still contemplating of installing urllink <UNK> in this new laptop ."
i still have urllink <UNK> but i rarely go there .
"albeit , having not <UNK> myself into a full - blown internet consumer , i am by huge chance prepared to join the pack ."
"i know they are poor choices of social forms but hey , that 's as realistic as can be ! sober ..."
"oh well , i book my tickets online too ."
urllink <UNK> has flying colors on my notes with online <UNK> and <UNK> check - <UNK> ... but i have no freaking idea why they behave like pal ?
then we got for sure the money and life <UNK> - online banking in nl .
urllink <UNK> <UNK> ( de bank ) does the trick .
urllink <UNK> quite so too ... absolute convenience is all i can say .
"lovely . the place <UNK> was cozy , in dutch it is suppose to mean <UNK> ."
typical european <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> of lettuce and shrimp .
"i am sure the main course did n't reach my <UNK> , anyhow i did n't bother <UNK> the fridge when i got home !"
"nonetheless , my time with my friend pat was <UNK> ."
our <UNK> and i wo n't further comment because my <UNK> knows this site and he might hack it down !
our un - never - finished houses ( her daughter called that the sink again <UNK> ! ) ... and of course what we want as <UNK> .
"she did want us to go visit london but <UNK> , i am not so <UNK> about it ."
"<UNK> , i was just there <#> months ago , but next year would be a different <UNK> ."
"i can just imagine : "" girl 's night out "" ."
"to top it all , it 's just an hour flight from <UNK> ;-) ."
maybe i will bring <UNK> to this <UNK> restaurant .
<UNK> - <UNK> for the <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> check system !
no more writing so - called money on paper .
i am <UNK> to this kind of <UNK> back in manila .
"i am terrible with numbers and i must - if i must , use excel to be able to add ( and minus ) things up ."
"i wish i have a personal <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ! !"
"so , here 's to dutch <UNK> : pin - <UNK> and online banking ( <UNK> too !"
but i never use this so we can forget about that hehe ) .
even the <UNK> cafeteria in the dark <UNK> in <UNK> up north has a pin system .
"on the contrary , credit cards are not that popular - take note ."
"with online banking , you manage all your portfolio via the internet ."
"banks give you this "" <UNK> "" code - a tiny <UNK> - like machine which is <UNK> to match a series of number codes together with your pin ."
these sober - looking <UNK> would probably give you their winning cheesy grin and say <UNK> !
"in reality , these <UNK> just want mundane things to be simpler , fast , efficient , organized and cheap ."
"nifty <UNK> , is how you can describe <UNK> all financial movements over the internet ."
:-( last night i stayed up ' till <UNK> checking jobs online .
i revised my cover letter so i can <UNK> some sparks and catch any attention worth catching !
i did n't match to their profile and requirements !
"oh well , you win some , you lose all !"
was nice to be back in the <UNK> of <UNK> .
"<UNK> asked me to join dinner together with his business colleague from the uk , matt er mister matt ."
<UNK> nice for a change .... except that the waiting ladies took a long time to wait on us for the food to be served !
"moreover , all i heard the whole evening was the <UNK> and <UNK> word , "" mister "" ."
do n't ask what it means because you 'll never get it anyway .
"a <UNK> in mister <UNK> 's world , kind of a secret boys club password . and"
thanks friendster for hosting it :-) my tales for the day
"i watched half of the "" the last samurai "" last night ."
it was freaking <#> am when i drift off to bed .
why does she have to scream her <UNK> out into her brains in order to get a point across ?
"then the new toy , my hp <UNK> <UNK> is doing ' <UNK> ' ."
"by the way , ' <UNK> <UNK> ' is back - <UNK> and a <UNK> temperature , supposedly for a nice summer day today .... but yesterday was <UNK> ?"
what did the dutch do to deserve this kind of <UNK> punishment ?
"i wrote a ton of <UNK> and when i hit "" publish "" , everything <UNK> into thin air ! ?"
i suppose i 'm a perfect example of <UNK> .
"i 'm <#> , contrary to my behavior to the contrary ..."
"i own my business , although at heart i 'm really a <UNK> ."
"if you believe in <UNK> , i 'm a <UNK> with some green ... <UNK> a red <UNK> ... or"
at least that 's what some lady in a barnes and noble once told me .
"( and <UNK> are where <#> typically has their <UNK> read , right ? )"
"well according to her webpage : <UNK> <UNK> are the most fun - loving , free - <UNK> , energetic , and <UNK> personalities in the <UNK> spectrum ."
"<UNK> are wonderful , sensitive , optimistic beings , whose life purpose is to bring joy to people , to have fun , and to help heal the planet ."
"blues blues are some of the most loving , <UNK> and supportive personalities of the life colors ."
"their purpose for being on the planet is to give love , to teach love and to learn that they are loved ."
"their priorities are love , relationships , and <UNK> ."
<UNK> <UNK> are some of the most powerful and intelligent people in the <UNK> spectrum .
they process information and ideas quickly ; jumping from steps <#> to ten .
they do not like dealing with all the steps and details in between .
changes in the area of sexual orientation happen as a result of a process which usually involves some hard personal work .
you could pray for years that vegetables would grow in your backyard .
"when nothing happens , you might even decide to be angry at some unseen being for not hearing your prayers ."
"however , the reality is that we must prepare the soil , plant the seeds , water and weed , and do other work ."
this gives the best chance that there will be an abundance of vegetables to <UNK> .
"in the same way , individuals who want to experience changes in their sexuality must do a lot of work as part of the process ."
we need to prepare the space in our lives for the growth that we desire .
how long the process of change from homosexuality to <UNK> takes depends on a number of factors .
these include : the root issues that are involved .
"the more difficult or complex the underlying factors involved in a person 's same - gender attraction , the longer the process of change may take ."
"for example , the process may take longer for a person who has experienced severe sexual abuse in childhood than for someone who has experienced mild sexual abuse ."
"for <#> man , most of the sexual abuse that happened in his childhood was worked through fairly quickly ."
"<#> particular abuse incident , however , took <#> years to work through because of the degree of shame and destruction of <UNK> involved ."
"the more helpful things a person puts in place , the better progress he or she can expect to make ."
<#> 's ability and willingness to face difficult personal issues .
related to willingness is the question of whether a person truly wants change .
"some individuals say they want to change , but are not prepared to take serious steps to accomplish this ."
it is not unusual for the process of change to take <#> - <#> years .
we are not talking about <#> - <#> years of going through hell !
many people change their identity much sooner than this .
significant relief from the intensity of homosexual feelings can also come much sooner .
"as with any deep personal issues which a person may want to change , there are no guaranteed results ."
"no <#> can promise you that in so - and - so many years , you will experience a complete change of sexual orientation ."
many people do experience a complete change of sexual orientation .
"where before they were only attracted to the same sex , they are now only attracted to the opposite sex ."
"they may now be fully attracted to the opposite sex and ready for marriage , with very little same - sex attraction remaining ."
"for others , there may be great change in their attraction toward the opposite sex without any change in their attraction to the same sex ."
others still may become able to make healthy choices in terms of their behaviour yet find that their <UNK> and desires remain the same .
"if <#> people are dealing with the same <#> issues , it is normal to expect different <UNK> ."
the issue that may be resolved quickly in <#> person 's life may take the other person years to work through .
an issue that may take <#> years for <#> person could take a lifetime for the other to resolve .
the best foundation for <UNK> on a journey of change : life is bigger than sexual orientation .
do not let your desire to leave homosexuality become the primary focus of your life .
"do not become obsessed with changing , as this also is unhealthy ."
"there may be times when you work very hard on changing this area of your life , and times when other things take priority ."
it is important to love and accept ourselves as we are today .
"hating something we do is <#> thing , especially if the behaviour <UNK> us or takes us away from knowing who we really are ."
"hating ourselves , on the other hand , is not good ."
"even hating the part of ourselves that is attracted to the same sex is not good and , in fact , just causes more pain ."
you do not have to use a label such as gay or lesbian .
"while we can not change what happened , we can change how it affects us today and how we understand what happened ."
"as the root issues are being resolved , we also need to <UNK> unhealthy patterns of living and thinking and learn new ones instead ."
"often , these patterns will have been <UNK> by fantasy and <UNK> ."
"if they are unhealthy habits , they need to be <UNK> and new ways of living and responding need to take their place ."
the process of change : the process of change is both different and the same for everyone .
"each person has a unique personality , personal history , support system , and so on ."
"at the same time , there are many common <UNK> which run through most people 's process of change ."
childhood sexual abuse and issues with <#> 's father or mother are <#> common roots which need to be worked through by many men and women .
"a feeling of being somehow "" different "" and accepting the labels that peers put on this <UNK> is also a common story ."
"the same kinds of resources tend to be helpful , though they may be needed in a different order and to different degrees ."
"change happens in the <#> areas of behaviour , fantasy , and attraction ."
"as change is a process , it is important to realize that change in <#> area may happen sooner than change in another area ."
"while we can make choices about what we do and what we think about , we have less control over feelings and <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , as he started working through various issues , he began to notice some attraction to women , even though his attraction to men had not yet changed ."
"much later , he began to find men less attractive than before ."
do not be discouraged when <#> area starts to change and another does not -- this is normal .
things may seem worse simply because we are starting to face past issues which before we ignored or denied .
"as well , this journey of change involves talking about sexual issues , which can be <UNK> in and of itself ."
"over time , discussion of sex will become more matter of fact ."
"when things first get worse instead of better , do not despair or give up ."
continue to work through your issues and find freedom and resolution .
"put extra support in place -- let a close friend know what you are feeling , attend a support group , talk with someone who 's been there ."
"in the process of change , there will be times when nothing is happening ."
this may be because we need a break after doing some hard personal work .
this may be because there is something blocking further progress .
"if you feel that you are on a <UNK> and that you may be "" stuck "" at this place in the process , talk to someone about it ."
often another person can be <UNK> in helping us identify what is preventing further change and what can be done to overcome that block .
"you need friends to walk with you on this journey , people who will stick by you and not <UNK> your trust ."
<#> does not want to share <#> 's personal life and struggles <UNK> .
this simply means meeting with another person regularly for the purpose of being held <UNK> .
"for example , if you have resolved that you do not want to buy any <UNK> but still find it a temptation to do so"
there is much to learn from others who are on a similar journey to yours .
individual <UNK> can be very helpful in working through some of the more difficult issues .
"choose a <UNK> carefully , finding out their perspective on change and homosexuality and what kind of experience they have working in this area ."
do not be intimidated by <UNK> who attempt to <UNK> you or influence your journey to a path other than the <#> you choose .
there are many good <UNK> who will support and <UNK> your journey .
"there are good books , articles , and <UNK> which you can read , websites to browse , and <UNK> to attend ."
"while information does not by itself produce change , it can give greater understanding and insight ."
we particularly recommend talking to those who have left homosexuality and reading their stories because ... change is possible !
"<UNK> , my friend could n't believe what she was hearing ."
"actually , her name 's not <UNK> . and"
"actually , she could believe what she was hearing ."
it was n't the first time her mother had <UNK> as to the company <UNK> was keeping .
it 's just that it had been a long time .
"she 'd drive up , visit for a bit , and then fly back ."
a friend would pick her up at the airport .
"if you 've never been a single girl , you may not be familiar with the universal mother <UNK> of male ."
""" what do i say ? "" she wondered . and thus began our journey into the uncomfortable land of status on demand ."
"in this world , persons of a certain age , circumstance and <UNK> are expected to report on their status at the drop of a hat ."
"basically , anybody who 's not yet married and who does n't yet have all of the children they 're planning to have is a status on demand candidate ."
"status on demand questions tend to begin with the oh - so - appealing words "" what "" or "" where "" or "" when . """
do you think he or she loves <UNK> you plan to stay at your job ?
i spent the first many years of my total many years responding <UNK> to status on demand ( <UNK> ) questions .
""" what do you plan to do next ? """
i wish i knew what i planned to do next .
he 's not comfortable talking about private things like his <UNK> for sex with animals who <UNK> .

"what would you do if you were me ? """
"like an idiot , i assumed that the asking of a question required an answer ."
"like an even bigger idiot , i assumed that those asking the questions had the right to know anything and everything about me ."
"i told people how i was doing , who i was doing , what i was doing and how i felt about what i 'd done ."
i told of my plans and my hopes and my dreams .
"and when i was n't doing anything or anyone , i <UNK> that too ."
and my life took on a life of its own .
"instead of just being and living , i was constantly thinking ."
thinking of the answers to the questions . and thinking about what the next questions would be .
"increasingly , i found myself preparing in advance for public functions ."
have i mentioned lately how much fun obsessive all - <UNK> are ?
"i ca n't quite recall when i shut up , but i 'm fairly certain it was related to some life transition ."
maybe it was around the time i wanted to leave the <UNK> side of law .
maybe it was around the time i wanted to stay with someone i was pretty sure i should leave .
maybe it was around the time i wanted to leave someone i was pretty sure i should stay with .
all i know was that i was living a <UNK> and literally had no idea what was next .
"hey , ca n't people tell when it 's a lousy time for questions ?"
the answer is that you often get the most questions - and the most annoying questions at the worst time .
"and so it was that at some point in my <UNK> evolution , i decided to just hand over the truth : "" i do n't know . """
and i found out quickly how truly uncomfortable people are with that answer .
""" what do you plan to do next ? """
""" do you want to have a baby ? """
""" do you want tai or japanese ? """

"it does n't sound like that nice of a response , but really it was incredibly nice ."

"was especially nice since i only said "" i do n't know . """
"but in <UNK> , i really should have just said the latter ."
"because time after time the <UNK> would follow up with "" have you considered ... ? "" or "" why do n't you ... ? """
"it took me a while to get used to the double "" do n't know . """
"for a while i tried gentle and polite <UNK> on "" i do n't know and i do n't care . """
"but i realized in short order that "" i do n't know "" really had to be followed by a second "" i do n't know . """
only by repeating the bottom line truth would the point be made without discussion .
"discussion , of course , was the most dangerous area : discussion implies willingness to consider , <UNK> to pondering and consent to <UNK> , analysis and criticism ."
and discussion invites the worst thing of all : other people 's <UNK> opinions .
it took me a while to not feel bad when the person seemed <UNK> or put out .
"luckily , though , overwhelming feelings of liberation took over ."
experiencing the present life was something i had n't really known how to do .
years of <UNK> others ' questions - and <UNK> actual <UNK> and weight to those questions - had left me thinking i should always know what 's next .
"i assumed i should always know what i wanted , what i did n't want , what was coming , what was <UNK>"
i assumed everybody else knew those things about their own lives .
"but in reality , few of us really know any of that until we actually <UNK> know ."
... why would you feel obligated to report to others ?
"why should others know your life details even when you do n't know ? """
"again , i <UNK> suspect that when she said she did n't know , she still managed to <UNK> and explain and apologize and justify much more than necessary ."
and i suspect that 's what happened when <UNK> truly did n't know .
the problem is that sometimes <UNK> does know .
and then she feels obligated to tell what she knows to anyone who asks .
"how in the world is it possible that i become good friends with such an honest , open , giving person ?"
"needless to say , i 've since given up on <UNK> ."
not in a general sense ; only in this very specific circumstance .
"and last night , with <UNK> nearby , an <UNK> stranger asked me what i would do if i only had <#> years left to live ."
i 'll just say that both are consistently high priority .
this is not to say that both are fully realized or regularly <UNK> goals on any particular day - or month or year .
it 's just that both activities <UNK> most other activities at any given time ... if only in theory .
but it never occurred to me to tell the stranger that i did n't know .
and it never bothered me that i 'd <UNK> .
perhaps it was because the question assumed a <UNK> circumstance .
or perhaps because the stranger had lovely blue eyes . perhaps because i was <#> great <UNK> and <#> mediocre <UNK> down already .
but i 'd venture to guess that my comfort with the <UNK> was based on what the question was n't .
the question was n't a challenge to my present life .
"the question was n't a suggestion of current holes , <UNK> or <UNK> ."
the question was n't a request for status of any kind .
"or an <UNK> that my life required more accomplishments , <UNK> or other measures of worth ."
"instead , the question was born purely of interest and curiosity and journalist spirit ."
i am obligated to report that the <UNK> stranger wo n't be part of either my sex or writing .
and i do n't <UNK> blue eyes picking me up from the airport .
the <UNK> stranger lives in a frustrated space <UNK> by pondering his future and wondering how his future will or will not reflect the normal complications of his past .
and he listened <UNK> while i explained my theories of zen management .
and why they were and why they were n't together .
"and then the <UNK> stranger asked : "" what would you do if you were me ? """
""" both feet in , dude . or both feet out . """
"because when <#> foot 's in and <#> foot 's out , you 're neither here nor there ."
"if my punishment were house arrest , i 'd commit all the crimes in the world ."
being <UNK> to hang out at home and not even being allowed to go out is a fantasy beyond all of my <UNK> fantasies .
my friends know that i 've always loved the idea of jail .
"in jail , i 'd be able to write all day long . and exercise at my leisure . and stay away from tempting foods ."
and i totally would n't mind doing some laundry or serving up some <UNK> .
"and in jail , i 'd admit fully to whatever i had done ."
"none of that "" i did n't do nothing "" for me ."
i 'd be guilty and i 'd be proud of it .

i ca n't believe i have to miss that !
house arrest would kick ass . and now the house arrest prize is going to martha stewart .
i 've done much worse things than the <UNK> maid martha .
o - o - o - o - o not fair .
not to mention the fact that house arrest in martha stewart 's house is probably not very <UNK> .
"then again , i suppose all <UNK> these days have at least <UNK> - count sheets ."
district court judge <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and asked her to <UNK> martha stewart 's sentence .
i pointed out that it 's not a good enough punishment for merry martha .
"if the judge really wants to make martha stewart feel pain , she should sentence ms ."
mommy martha would feel pain here like she 's never imagined possible .
sheets that do n't match . and a fridge incapable of inspiring anything other than <UNK> .
"and an <UNK> influenced more by <UNK> and cell phones than by <UNK> , <UNK> arrangements and homemade <UNK> ."
"actually , at my house , martha would have double punishment ."
now i 'm not saying i ca n't get into high thread counts and homemade candles .
it 's just that the high does n't last very long .
martha would cringe when i consistently <UNK> the <UNK> room <UNK> instead of the <UNK> orange on odd days of the week .
martha 's sense of order would be completely <UNK> every time i confused the ' for show ' pillows with the ' for sleep ' pillows .
"in my house , martha would feel nothing but <UNK> ."
"okay , perhaps she 'd feel a bit of disgust too ."
martha will suffer <UNK> and i 'll have an excuse for avoiding life without having to commit a crime .

""" oh no ! i ca n't believe i have to miss that !"
"since her divorce with <UNK> <UNK> turned politician <UNK> <UNK> in june this year , <UNK> <UNK> is under constant media <UNK> ."
some media reports have even been suggesting that she has already started her new innings of life with british actor <UNK> grant .
"so far nobody has bothered to look at her very important third and an ongoing affair , which is also in trouble ."
"yes , i’m talking about <UNK> ’s affair or marriage with islam ."
after the second reading i found the article very important .
"in following paragraphs i’ll explain , in light of <UNK> ’s article , why is the relationship between <UNK> and islam going through difficult times ?"
"why i chose <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> western women ’s ‘ access to <UNK> , alcohol and revealing clothes as ‘"
"<UNK> , a <UNK> , in the company of many celebrities including <UNK> grant ."
"so , has <UNK> <UNK> become less ‘ <UNK> or western dresses have become more ‘"
it means that her marriage and divorce with <UNK> have nothing to do with her <UNK> to islam .
<#> can pose another question to the british <UNK> in light of her previous claims .
her life before and after marriage or a <#> - year period of <UNK> life ?
"so , we are <UNK> waiting for the second installment of ‘ why i chose <UNK>"
"they have a lot of cleaning to do , but at least they are alive ."
i would be completely beside myself if anything happened to them .
i still have n't been able to get in touch with my friends in key west but i will try again tomorrow morning .
"okay , with that little bit out of the way i can talk about myself now ."
i was born a poor black child in <UNK> florida ( insert joke here ) .
"for you people that need a geography lesson , that 's <#> miles east of <UNK> or <#> miles west of <UNK> ."
i was raised by my mother as i did n't have my father around for all of my childhood .
"we did n't have much of anything , but we were truly loved ."
my mom raised us well and also went back to school to get her degree in social work .
"sometimes we had to take care of ourselves , but we understood the greater good in all this ."
what we did n't have in material possessions she made up in love .
"for that she taught me that there is good in everyone , even the worst of people ."
"people always tell me , "" well you do n't act black ... "" ."
i was raised that <UNK> are for idiots and you can be so much more if you just apply yourself and be yourself .
"people act a certain way because they might think it 's cool , or it might get them what they want ."
"believe me , acting "" ghetto "" would get me nothing in <UNK> , but just being "" me "" would get me a long way in life ."
she wanted better for me and hanging around them would n't get me to where i needed to be in life .
"in middle and high school i was good in sports , but i figured it was easier for me to play an instrument , so i joined band ."
"i picked up instruments pretty easy , but since there was a need for <UNK> players i played that and it stuck with me till this day ."
"i never got a scholarship , but i did get accepted , so off to <UNK> i went ."
what you see is what you get and i am loyal to the end .
"it 's an awesome responsibility being <UNK> , but i do n't mind ."
"oh , and for you new readers <UNK> is my given name ."
my father 's middle name is <UNK> as well .
it 's a family name passed down from the <UNK> in oklahoma where my father 's people are .
i get <UNK> so much about the middle name because people either think my parents are <UNK> or that i am a complete <UNK> .
: <UNK> is on so i am going to jet .
i hope some of my ramblings are interesting to you and i 'll be writing more and more as the days go on .
i just decided to get on for a bit and talk before i hit the hay .
i might have a busy day tomorrow because of <UNK> ....
<UNK> hope not ) well i felt so good after starting this last night .
"i 've been wanting to do something like this for a long time , but not had the courage to do it ."
it 's kinda like doing it for the first time .
"everyone is on pins and needles because of this storm , but <UNK> always gets worked up over nothing ."
talked online to my normal group of friends and also a new person that i met a couple saturdays ago .
"we really do n't have any "" deep "" conversations yet , but maybe that 's because i am not ready to give in yet ."
did n't get a chance to much to talk to my really cool friend online .
i like talking to her ... she really <UNK> my day .
when i was really down back in october it was kinda like she was sent to me to bring me out of my funk .
"i owe her a lot , but she already knows that ... :) sitting here watching law and <UNK> ."
"i do n't know why , but i really like the show , but i am a law and order <UNK> ."
"this <#> is a repeat , but i still watch them <UNK> anyway ."
i just needed to clear my head before it hit the pillow .
"anyway , the "" <UNK> <UNK> "" noise just came back on"
so i better get back to the idiot box .
it was nice writing tonight and i promise i 'll write more tomorrow .
i been looking at so many blogs and i 've had so much to write that i decided that i am going to take a stab at this .
i 'm not going to tell an awful lot tonight because i just wanted to put something down
i 'll start writing more usually in the <UNK> before i go home or maybe before i got to bed ( most of my best thoughts come out then )
"as time goes on i will add more and more items and hope that you tune in .... if not , it does n't really matter in the end ."
"after a great <UNK> match , evolution completely <UNK> out <UNK> ."
it was refreshing for wrestling to go back to the old days when the beat downs came after a new <UNK> was <UNK> .
"looks like <UNK> will be turning into a good guy sooner than i expected ... anyway back to my ramblings .... well , i did it ."
i sent that email that i was talking about yesterday .
"it was something that i did n't want to do , but i felt it was needed ."
"like i said , i was tired of being blown off and either i will lose a friend or at least the lines of communication will start up again ."
it 's either hard and fast or nothing at all .
life is way too short to beat around the bush .
"now do n't get me wrong , i am not blunt when it comes to people , but i do n't like to play games ."
"before my divorce i was a lot different , because i was more about "" we "" and not "" me "" ."
"maybe if i would have paid attention to "" me "" a little more back then things would be different ."
well there is this girl that is a friend of mine .
we met back in october while i was playing an online game during a work break ( hope no <#> at work is reading this ... )
"and i was basically trying to stir the pot and get them together , but then we ended up talking ."
we hit it off really quick and we started talking daily .
she helped me so much after the divorce to realize that the world is not coming to an end and there is so much to live for .
she showed me that the passion that my ex wife told me that i did n't have was n't true .
with that i started dating someone here at work and was able to show her passion that i thought was gone .
"even though that work relationship did n't last i knew that i am still "" good "" ."
i knew that this was someone that i could fall for easily ... and guess <UNK> did .
i did understand that there was a distance thing between us and she also started to becoming interested in a guy that lives near her .
but i would rather have her in my life as a friend or nothing at all .
it could be at her wedding or it might be on a trip she comes to florida or i go out to oklahoma .
all i know is that she has done something for me that not to many people have done .
she 's really made me happy and for that i love her ....
"<UNK> i told ya i would write about you.. ) so like i said , i do things either hard and fast or nothing at all ."
if you do n't take a risk in something you can never really know what you 're made of .
"no only have i been here since <UNK> this morning , when i went to lunch"
i saw the girl i used to date .... ugh .
"i do n't know if she saw me , but i saw her ."
sometimes i wonder what i even saw in her .
"and i was starting to have really good feelings about <UNK> something further , but i think she pushed and i was n't ready to commit ."
"we started dating after the divorce , the sex was awesome , but what really possessed me into getting involved with her ?"
"maybe it was that "" nothing ventured , nothing gained "" attitude that i have , but it 's also gotten me into trouble as well ."
maybe i should n't have started seeing her so quickly after the divorce .
:) i think if i don't ..... soon i am going to go <UNK> ....
well i have paperwork to get off my desk .
"i need to write more , but i want this to sit for a while ."
maybe after i read it i will write more later .
i figured i would take some of my lunch hour off and write a little in here while it was fresh on my mind .
"by the looks on all their faces , things are not going very well down there ."
i also just found out that <#> of my online friends lost a friend this morning .
she died in her sleep and was only <#> .
please say a prayer tonight for her and her family as well .
.... do n't you hate people that are fake ?
lately it feels like more and more people i have been in contact with are just so ... fake .
i have more people that i talk to online that are more honest than the people that i consider close to me .
"i am going to do something i really do n't want to do , but i have to ."
"i might get a note , or maybe a call , or maybe nothing ..."
the director of <UNK> is across the street with our governor right now
"so that when your head <UNK> , at least you 'll have all the pieces ."
"well , <UNK> and i took the <UNK> last night ."
"he probably spent more time talking us out of buying it , then once we decided he let us know how he believes we made the best decision ."
he spent a lot of time talking about how much work it 's going to <UNK> .... how many headaches .
".... then , he ran the numbers for us and showed how good of an investment it is ."
"at 11:00 last night , we signed the contract ."
we 'll see what 's going to happen from here !
"btw - in case you did n't realize , the translation for the title is "" house of who 's yo daddy """

"my name is <UNK> smith , and i 'm a pretend celebrity boyfriend ."
last week we discussed whether to reveal the <UNK> of our pretend civilian girlfriends and the vote was taken .
"it was close , but ultimately we decided to do it ."
"well , i really do n't know her true identity ."
she <UNK> herself only as the doctor 's friend <UNK> .
that 's what mine 's been calling herself too !
"i mean , right after "" dodgeball "" came out , she called herself average jane , kind of in tribute to me , i guess ."
it seems as if we 've all been chosen by the same psycho .
"my <UNK> also has recently adopted <UNK> after a long string of <UNK> , including <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"<UNK> : guys , you 're not going to believe this ."
but the reason i 'm here tonight is i got this letter yesterday from some woman who signed herself <UNK> .
<UNK> : do you think we are all being <UNK> by the same woman ?
"however , this <UNK> <UNK> is not the <UNK> <UNK> that has been <UNK> with yours truly ."
"<UNK> , it seems my <UNK> is a <UNK> who goes by the <UNK> "" <UNK> . """
"sting : as always , it seems bob 's vocabulary has confused us all ."
that 's all the time we have for this week .
do n't forget : next week is <UNK> and is also the meeting where we all read our favorite passages from our <UNK> 's letters .
"meanwhile , all <UNK> the crazy train . goodnight ."
"erin , i totally get your fascination with <UNK> ."
it 's just weird that his name is <UNK> .
it 's like being named farmer or <UNK> or <UNK> or something .
"speaking of our favorite journalists , dave has some pretty hilarious olympics commentary today at urllink <UNK> . if it asks you to log in , use mine ."

"and tonight we 're going to see the freakin ' village , baby !"
"no non - funny , non - trivial posts today ."
nevermind that my family is about to be blown into <UNK> by nature 's wrath .
days like this make me want to go home and drink .
i just called our vet to advise them of our decision regarding jane dog .
we did decide after many tears to end her life .
mean people suck and they go straight to hell .
days like today make me wish i could help them get there a little faster .
so ... <UNK> ... is your fam going to ride it out or are they getting the heck out of dodge ?
i discovered that i can leave home with wet hair and by the time i get to work it will be dry and will actually look halfway decent .
"so the dr . and i are now the proud owners of a brand new , $ <#> mr ."
he even comes in a clear plastic suitcase to store him and all his parts .
"of course , i think you can still store some things in his butt , which i think must be really handy ."
i spent my lunch break driving to <UNK> to the toys r us to buy him .
the dr . wants him for something he 's doing in his lesson tonight .
i also want to give him a name .
funny story that i 'm reminded of : my sister 's pastor has <#> young boys .
"<#> of them , when he was very small , because of his extended exposure to church and church people , called his own <UNK> friend brother potato head ."
"when i heard that story , i immediately thought of all kinds of marketing tie - <UNK> ."
"for instance , he could come with his own offering plate and large <UNK> bible ."
urllink <UNK> special warning to <UNK> : : do not drink <UNK> <UNK> while reading !
does anybody remember the newest is that <UNK> <UNK> came up with sunday at lunch ?
i hope you 've all successfully created your blogger accounts .

"you can also add new posts by going to the dashboard and clicking on the "" new post "" icon ."
<UNK> is a public blog but only members can add comments .
so far it 's just the <#> of us .
i want to get rid of the the profile since it 's not my blog .
"for the past week , i have been baby - sitting my <#> school going kids because their grandmother aka my mother - in - law had taken ill ."
she has been the <#> who 's been looking after them since they were born .
"in the early days of our marriage until the <#> kids came along , we have been living with our in - laws ."
"so it 's natural for us to turn to them for help in looking after our children , especially when we both were at work ."
"my husband , being the <UNK> father that he is , is unwilling to <UNK> to the use of maid in our child - <UNK> ."
"in any case , my in - laws were so happy to have <UNK> ( to carry on the <UNK> they have been very willing to do so ."
"after all , babies are fun to play with ."
"and of course , when i had to <UNK> treatment for my breast cancer , her help was <UNK> ."
i simply had no energy to take care of my children except in their homework which i continue to monitor since my husband has no patience to teach them .
it helps that the school where my children go to is within my in - law 's <UNK> .
"in any case , the school bus refused to take my children to my house since there 's no other students staying in the <UNK> ."
then she will wait at the bus stop at <#> pm to fetch son # <#> home and see that he eat his meals .
"in the evening at <UNK> , she will again wait at the bus - stop to receive son # <#> ."
my husband will go from his office to his mother 's house for dinner and then picked up the kids and return to our own home .
"this has been the routine for almost <#> years now , since i lost my job ."
but last week has been a roller - coaster kind of sorts for me .
thus begin a hectic week of sending / pickup / cooking / homework routine .
"if all goes according to schedule , my husband will drop off son # <#> in the morning on his way to work ."
"but alas , son # <#> has <UNK> class on tuesday and needed to be picked up <#> hours later than usual ."
"then , son # <#> has <UNK> on thursday and needed to be in school for an hour and half somewhere in mid - morning ."
"yes , i do n't trust my maid , even though she 's very intelligent and needed little <UNK> or instructions to know what i want from her ."
"my maid has been with me since feb last year , brought in mainly to do the house chores when i <UNK> cancer treatment ."
"i have never <UNK> my sons in her care , though they are already in the age of <#> years and <#> years old ."
", he will call back everyday just to make sure the maid behave herself ."
"i think i would too , when my turn to be a granny comes ."
i have sent out so many job applications since i was <UNK> from my job in aug <#> .
i had actually <UNK> my medical history on the first interview so that i can be judged on my work experience .
"if there 's a second interview , then i 'll inform them ."
"sure enough , i was called up for the second interview just <#> days after ."
"of course , at the end of the second interview , i drop ' the <UNK> ' ."
"well , the reactions were quite re - <UNK> as the group of board members dismissed it as a non - issue ."
"so when no phone calls came after <#> weeks , i know i 'm doomed once again ."
they told me that they have not heard of such cases nor received any feedback from its members .
"in any case , their mission now is to create awareness and <UNK> older women to <UNK> <UNK> for early <UNK> ."
so my case was dismissed - just like that !
and i 'm not sure with whose agenda are they promoting ?
i <UNK> need an income to pay off the bank <UNK> i took on the house and my study .
i had thought if i upgrade and arm myself with a mba that my chances of <UNK> my career will be better .
i have seen my colleagues in the previous dept completely wiped out when a new head was hired .
his <UNK> have all worked for him in his previous <UNK> .
he find fault in everything i do even though it 's done according to procedure .
"so he <UNK> my employment , even though i volunteered to be transferred to another division ."
"like my husband said , the corporate world now is different from <UNK> ."
"so what if you have worked a long time for the company , that you have vast experiences in certain areas ..."
"first time in hey , hey , hey , i just got my weblog"
"- now i can penn down my thoughts and things that happen around me , which has been plenty over the past year or so ."
"it 's a battle that i have to fight alone , and yet i have to pretend to my children that i 'm strong , i 'm ok ...."
"most if not all the times , i have to go for <UNK> treatment alone"
and hopefully this weblog is going to help me put my thoughts in order .

find a <UNK> then or <UNK> it we <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> this torment for over <#> <UNK> if not less .

life just <UNK> when you see you <UNK> <UNK> it <UNK> .
"feel <UNK> most you do n't need <UNK> in life , you could feel no pressure <UNK> <UNK> ."
true enough we <UNK> born without <UNK> on us ... why we expect <UNK> now ?
"sounds <UNK> , but look <UNK> you <UNK> you seeing the light <UNK> the end of the tunnel ?"
"if you do , will you be <UNK> there ?"
still life goes on but not just oneself ... we need friends <UNK> love ones .
here it is <UNK> merry <UNK> <UNK> your thoughts here .
"i would if you could , should we <UNK> a <UNK> without the blues ?"
knowing that we go to mexico this week makes it very hard to come to work for these few days .
i 've got stuff to do like washing clothes and packing .
"this had better be a good trip , cause getting here has been a royal pain ."
from <UNK> 's problem with his work schedule to how much it 's all going to cost and then finally having to rent a family van .
it 's very stressful and the beach had better be <UNK> .
i am a bit worried about family <UNK> between the group with <UNK> 's <UNK> and our group .
<UNK> 's <UNK> have been just <UNK> lately and <UNK> .
"i really need to enjoy myself , actually <UNK> , brandon and i really need to enjoy ourselves as a family ."
i want brandon to have a good experience and not witness any family <UNK> .
"wish i had a digital camera to post "" baby on the beach "" pics ."
maybe next time ( who knows when that will be ) .
we hung around the house over the weekend watching the olympics .
i got some house cleaning done - so we wo n't leave a pit behind to return to .
i was hoping the carpet cleaning guys would call so they could clean the <UNK> while we are in mexico .
"i watched a little diving , swimming , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
"oh , i almost got in trouble with the hubby because of a <UNK> <UNK> ."
"and when we went to watch it , it cut out after like <#> min ."
brandon was poking buttons when it was recording and hit <UNK> that night while i was putting the towels away .
"luckily , the show repeated last night and i was able to record it - no problems ."
"so we did n't miss a thing , whew !"
i just need to make sure the <UNK> is set to record <UNK> and <UNK> next week while we are gone .
"ok , i think i 'm done rambling on wasting precious proposal writing time ."
"think i 'll surf a little web next , check out those olympic scores ."
"i am very sleepy , could hardly stay awake while driving to work ."
i think auto pilot was on because i do n't remember the ride .
"sweet brandon has a very bad habit going , waking in the middle of the night screaming until you go get him ."
i took <UNK> last night and so i 'm very out of it ( could n't believe brandon was even able to wake me from my <UNK> ) .
i really do wish to be in bed right now .
let 's hope my face does n't hit the keyboard today .
"so last night the family made a target run , we <UNK> up on our <UNK> and non - <UNK> for next weeks trip to mexico ."
"<UNK> went a little over board <UNK> up on <UNK> summer clothes , oh well he needs the clothes ."
"<#> days till we are in mexico , hay <UNK> !"
"the olympics start tonight , i am looking forward to watching the opening <UNK> and keeping up with the us and mexican teams ."
"i love watching the games , especially diving and <UNK> ."
i 'm sure we 'll be watching <UNK> too .
"hope i get some good sleep tonight , i really need it !"
"where oh where has summer gone , oh where oh where has it gone ?"
"for it being the hottest month of <UNK> , we are falling really short ."
"only in the <#> 's today , i ca n't wait to be in mexico next week ."
"as i sit here at work , i 'm pretty much sleeping ."
i must be careful not to let my face hit the keyboard as my head <UNK> from <UNK> .
"up at <#> am , <#> am and <UNK> - screaming until i come for him ."
i think there is too much <UNK> going on during the day - that will have to stop !
let 's hope for a better night tonight and a warmer day tomorrow .
"family , friends , trips and more .... you know .... day - to - day stuff ."
see you around from time to time ( de <UNK> en <UNK> ) .
"this is my first time again .... as an author , i somehow like to think that my words would <UNK> me ."
therefore i really hope that my blogs here will not go the way of my previous <#> blogs ...
"this is my fifth attempt to maintain a "" proper "" blog ."
:-( and i never bothered to backup .
that makes me feel like a lousy it <UNK> .
"i keep <UNK> about the value of "" <UNK> "" to my clients while i never even have a backup copy of my blogs ."
"i try to <UNK> it by saying that * my * blogs are <UNK> thoughts and do not really have value ... except to me ,"
"in all that time , there was only <#> recorded instance of somebody actually reading them ."
"he or she left a comment , and i remember it clearly : "" do n't worry about what others think"
"if they have an opinion on anything , let them write their own comments ."
you have a <UNK> ] potential and you seem very intelligent .
"at first , i did n't get what he or she meant , particularly about my "" <UNK> potential "" . if i reference the random house <UNK> 's dictionary"
"then again , he or she probably meant i can "" be noble "" or "" have a <UNK> character "" ."
and what 's this about keeping it up ?
"i do n't know if somebody has done this before , but i will certainly try it ."
"so to * alter - ego * , wherever and whoever you are ."
i wish that someday you visit this blog .
i sincerely hope that this is an <UNK> beginning .
"to err is human , to foul up things require a computer ."
"went to <UNK> garage , was full of old folk ."
somehow ended up in a ford garage and got a focus <UNK> .
"i 'm not a big fan of the focus , but this <#> seems ok ."
"not a bad deal , ex - demo £ <#> , <#> miles ."
there 's something about it that i just do n't like .
"it 's very <UNK> and makes me jump a lot , but that does n't really make a good game ."
"that 's very early for me , but i was <UNK> last night , so i went to bed early ."
today looks like it will be a busy day .
"not a big sports fan , specially when loads of them cheat ."
and i never thought i 'd ever want a <UNK> .
my cars done <#> miles and is worth next to nothing and now i need a new <#> .
so i 'm thinking i 've getting a <UNK> only now the difference between a <UNK> and a skip is
"<#> - <#> in <#> <UNK> and <UNK> and really , it 's a <UNK> ."
"well i do n't just want any <UNK> , i want the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"never know , i may even get <#> ."
it 's been very strange being on my own .
"i have to say i was shocked , i never read any newspapers or magazines , so i did n't know it was coming ."
"went to the pics and saw i , robot ."
"although i watched far too many <UNK> , it did n't spoil the film for me ."
"special effects were very good , hard to spot what is and is n't real ."
i 'm guessing that a <#> robots running about was <UNK> .
"do n't know why , just for something to do ."
"it was either that or visual studio .net and i ca n't think of anything i 'll do , if i learn how to use that ."
"not much has happened today , in my life anyway ."
i put a washing line post in the ground and spent most of the day either watching tv or on pc .
i did go to <UNK> and find out that my car probably needs new <UNK> <UNK> .
i think that part also has the <UNK> <UNK> on it as well .
"now you know when parts for you cars have many <UNK> , the price goes way up for them ."
ca n't work out if i liked it or not really .
"i guess it was ok , but could do better ."
"i 'm sure there are people that will think it 's a masterpiece , but it 's not ."
"friday the 13th , unlucky for some , so i hear ."
"not at all i think , some people have good things and bad things happen all the time to them ."
"however , the good luck is that it 's on the <UNK> and i 've got to wait <#> months ."
"well , was loads better than the <UNK> chili con <UNK> i had ."
"they say all is well , i beg to differ ."
"anyway a man will be fixing it tomorrow , sometime between <#> am an <#> am , so i have to get up early and it 's a saturday ."
"catching up with friends and family , all of them <UNK> me on the amazing wins this week have brought me ."
"too <UNK> up over the win , and awoke this morning at <#> am ready to go straight away !"
usually it takes an hour or so to get ‘ with <UNK> first thing
but it was like i <UNK> straight awake !
no <#> could believe my luck and requested i leave some <UNK> for them next month !
"<UNK> the lucky dog back in treats , purchased today a very large bag of <UNK> <UNK> to keep the dog happy ."
"what a great time this is , the memories may fade but at least i felt like a lottery winner for a time ."
i 've still not calmed down as we say in <UNK> -
i 'm just a bit <UNK> up you might say .
i 've been on edge all day looking at our wedding venue in <UNK> ( the palm house in <UNK> park - its lovely ) .
"no call at <UNK> , i 'm getting increasingly more nervous , then i get called at <UNK> and we start after the track has finished ."
i 'm <UNK> it big style ! ! ! ! !
getting more nervous then the dj asks ' how long on average each year do la residents spend in traffic <UNK> ? ' nearest wins !
the person after me then says <#> i think .
"i was with beth 's family at the time we all nearly had heart attacks , the memory of that moment will last forever ."
"fantastic ! a holiday in la in a <#> star hotel , mini for the week and well great really , words fail me ."
this win has got to be the best so far !
i’ve just won £ <#> on a <UNK> show called memory bank .
i thought wow that i had won some <UNK> first thing this morning but this caps it off just nicely ; just need <UNK> win to come in now .
i 've been able to <UNK> about my win around work and really piss off all the <UNK> heads around in their fast cars !
"a- -- and i just had our <UNK> "" discussion "" about us ."
"he does n't seem to understand where i 'm coming from , or his own emotions ."
"i then asked him , if i said ok , could he actually do those things ."
"he said , "" i would definitely try , but <UNK> is very busy ."
"i do n't want you to have high expectations , or even medium . """
"the more i know him , the more i realize he is just wired differently than everyone else ."
"to me , all i see are empty promises and someone who says "" you ca n't depend on me ."
i told him to contact me if and when he is at a place where i can depend on him to do the things he promises .
i think i m is the worst thing that ever happened !
"( alas , it works well for real work stuff . )"
did anyone see that truly <UNK> <UNK> from russia ?
"oh my , i felt like i was watching a walking <UNK> ."
i was surprised she did n't <UNK> over from lack of energy .
i went out to lunch with a- -- yesterday .
"all my negative feelings seem to have resolved themselves , because we had a lot of fun ."
"he would love to maintain our "" relationship "" but we actually did n't talk about that ."
he had a hard time not touching me -- constantly just brushing my hand or my knee or grabbing my arm .
he seemed a lot more normal than he did when i was so upset .
"i project my feelings as much as everyone else , i guess ."
too bad he ca n't get it together and tolerate time with someone .
"whatever he has that appeals to me , it sure appeals ."
so the topic that <UNK> my mind ( this is so <UNK> woman ) is romantic relationships .
it 's the <#> thing that i think i am worst at doing well .
"i 'm <#> , a single heterosexual woman , never married , and i have n't been in a long relationship since college ."
"although i have had a few positive relationships , the <#> men i have "" hung out with "" in the past year have been terrible for me ."
"i 'm sure they are nice enough men on their own , but they were bad matches ."
"he captured my attention because he seemed smart and witty , although he clearly had some add ."
"we began going to lunch regularly , and at the end of the first week , we went out for drinks after work ."
"part of my brain kept saying , "" this will never work , this is crazy . """
another part of me really liked the attention and that <UNK> attraction .
"it turned out that a has almost no time in his life , but worse , that he needs large blocks of time to himself to feel okay ."
he admitted he needed <#> - <#> hours alone every day to feel okay .
"so his priorities of work , time alone , and some side work he did as a photographer used up all his time ."
"over the <#> months we hung out , we only met outside of work <#> times ."
he also took me out to a nice lunch on my birthday .
""" now i do n't think many rational people would call this a relationship ."
"i got very emotionally wrapped up in it , however , because we were spending so much time <UNK> ."
"worse , he was pushing my emotional buttons in a big way , because he was promising so much ."
"he would talk as if marriage was in our future , but then he could n't make time to see me ."
"he wanted to be my <UNK> , and i was the garden ."
but he could n't spend any time with me .
"and he could n't see that this was a <UNK> , a problem ."
"anyway , i tried to cut it off multiple times , but he would just ignore that and continue as is ."
but i was so mad at him for so long .
it felt like he was holding out a <UNK> of love and then always <UNK> it back when i walked toward him .
"there are other details here , painful to admit ."
"i 'll stop here -- if you want to know more , tell me . and remember , all analysis is fair game !"
"here 's my idea : what if i tell you all about my life , and i invite you ( whoever you are ) to analyze me ?"
but it led me to this thought : what if there was a blogging community that invited others to read and analyze the writer ?
"so , here 's the official invitation : please give me your analysis and feedback ."
you can comment on any aspect of my psychology or life .
"you can project your own issues on me ( a little counter - <UNK> , anyone ? ) ."
"use me , my words , my life , as a mystery for you to solve ."
"really , it seems to me that this is how many of us relate to other people anyway -- by <UNK> them <UNK> or <UNK> ."
b. my life happens when the lights are on .
c. i do n't want to work nights .
i can <UNK> with you because i feel the same way .
when life ( your job ) demands a <UNK> existence you have to adapt .
"get up , drink coffee and or tea and stay up for <#> or more hours ."
go back to bed and sleep for <#> or more hours .
when you get up you are more or less ready to stay up all night .
b. when you go to sleep in the am .
for your daylight sleep think about doing the following : take <UNK> and or <UNK> before you hit the bed .
"( for adults ) depending on your <UNK> , is a natural <UNK> produced in your <UNK> <UNK> that influences your daily rhythm 's and sleep cycle ."
it is also an <UNK> ( good for you ) and most people find it has no side affects .
you can get it at most grocery stores and <UNK> shops .
<UNK> is an <UNK> that has been used for centuries to help folks get <UNK> before bed .
<UNK> and i find it more <UNK> that <UNK> .
it has a funky <UNK> but once it is down the <UNK> it is very helpful in <UNK> out the <UNK> so it can sleep .
"as in all <UNK> and <UNK> or <UNK> , read the instructions ."
use heavy curtains or shades over your bedroom windows so very little light gets in your sleeping area .
light has a way of waking you up more easily during the <UNK> than darkness .
it also <UNK> with time shifting which is <UNK> on <UNK> your body into thinking it is sleeping at night .
"what did you expect , a <#> page term paper ? <UNK>"
it is the key to transition from the world of the day <UNK> to the night life and back again .
"you would think i would tell you about it now but truth is , its time for me to become unconscious ."
i will be back with some suggestions that do work .
in the mean time think and read up on <UNK> and i 'll be back with my time proven technique to alter your waking and sleeping <UNK> .
sometimes that 's all i got to say when i get to this place .
she 's wearing a simple <UNK> <UNK> dress with dangerous heels .
now i 've got a <UNK> in my neck .
it 's taking me a moment to scan the rest of the girls because i keep looking up and she 's still walking around .
"i 've seen this dress before , and it was <#> that she wore <#> evening that was identical to <UNK> 's ."
it 's <UNK> black with white lace on the shoulders and for little <UNK> on the bottom at the front and back .
"she just went behind the bar again , so i should be able to <UNK> and find tee ."
"i saw tee out of the corner of my eye a minute ago , there ."
"tee , no glasses tonight , and dark eye makeup ."
"a <UNK> look for her , as she 's usually <UNK> and bright ."
"i can see the changes since she 's been here , learning the <UNK> , picking it up in the outfit department ."
in the beginning you could see the struggle to find something to wear to fit in .
"the real difference between this place and the few others like it that i 've <UNK> , is that these girls dress like women , not girls ."
"she 's in black , and she 's done something with her short hair , kinda wild ."
"the dress has <UNK> tied behind her neck , and there is a small v cut into the top in front ."
"some spanish style <UNK> at the back adding some appreciated volume to the back yard , a little <UNK> something to follow around with the old <UNK> ."
i now spy tina sitting behind the bar with <UNK> .
i 'll have to wait a minute or <#> for full <UNK> .
"tina ca n't wear a bad thing , and she 's not ."
it 's a white top with spaghetti <UNK> <UNK> with a light blue and white print skirt .
long thin <UNK> stolen from a couple of champagne glasses .
and no insanely hot <UNK> girls serving me tea .
"i would weep , but i do n't want my view distorted until i have to drive home ."
it looks like the evil sack - o - tomatoes kings are losing to the bucks .
"if the lakers can win tomorrow without kobe , the kings are <UNK> for first place ."
"not likely , but second place is for sure not out of reach ."
"when i first heard about the new <UNK> last year , i laughed out loud for days ."
who could have predicted the wacky <UNK> that includes kobe facing life in prison ?
"i know , i know , anybody who 's been watching for more than <#> seasons ."
"but really , it 's <UNK> , no ?"
i have been pondering the wisdom of linking to my other blog .
now i 'm going to put it on the <UNK> .
"the <#> blogs are pretty different , this <#> being the more fun and silly of the <#> , at least that was the plan ."
"but , what the fuck , sometimes things happen that i ca n't keep my mouth shut about ."
"so just like <UNK> <UNK> does , and that fellow <UNK> , i 'm linking to the other place that nobody reads and i do n't get paid for ."
talent report : ( even though i 'm actually waiting for ed to get here so we can go get some <UNK> ) .
"and she 's got the high collar <UNK> on as well as farm girl , who took my order tonight for the first time ever ."
i had to ask her to wipe the crap off the table though so it would n't get all over the laptop .
"<UNK> the sweet came over and made the same hand motion that i made to farm girl , smiled , and set me up ."
"<UNK> , miss vietnam is in tonight looking smashing as is the no longer mysterious <UNK> ."
"i found out the other night while sitting at the bar and <UNK> that spring break is coming up , which means we get to see more of her ."
"she 's still a ' good girl , ' and her family comes to pick her up after her shift , which ends long before the place closes ."
the lakers are playing the bucks and the game is pretty close at the half .
it looks like i 'm going to squeeze ed to go get italian tonight .
"i do n't know any good italian places down here , i have to go to eagle rock ( pizza , hmm ) or <UNK> for pasta and <UNK> ."
"i can count on <#> hand the decent places , ( i have <#> fingers on my left hand ) and <#> of them are <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i must have not seen the score well enough , the lakers are up by ten at the beginning of the third ."
i 'll post later if ed scares up a nice plate of spaghetti and meat balls .
poor courtney love is being <UNK> about the urllink press ( courtesy of the charming <UNK> .
"what , no <UNK> , she wo n't get a damn blog , want her email ? ] ."
it 's hard to be a rock and roller these days .
"it used to be just good plain fun , like when <UNK> did <UNK> wearing nothing but electrical tape ( ouch - that must have hurt ) ."
"now , whether you are the sister of the king o pop or just a poor rock and roll <UNK> , people talk ."
"i think though , that we 've become <UNK> ."
", they are so - not - real i would recommend a <UNK> ."
"i know <UNK> that have <UNK> for less , and they 're not even porn stars ."
"they did a reasonable job on her mug , but the boobs ?"
it 's a <UNK> of the female form .
"if you had to look at those things in the mirror every day , what would you do ?"
"she 's sharing , and as the <UNK> class would say , that 's good ."
"go ahead courtney , get it off your chest ."
"boy , i just finished <#> of my devastating political pieces on the other blog ."
my brain gets sore when i take on the powerful special interests and political class and the major media and all the other guys that rule the world .
"i 'm just lucky , i guess , that the only other blog that i know of that gets read less than that urllink <#> is this <#> ."
otherwise the <UNK> of the patriot act would find me despite the tin <UNK> and sentence me to weeks of <UNK> reading the new york times .
"but , as it were , i 'm safe here at <UNK> 's , <UNK> whipped cream and bananas into my mouth ."
it 's crowded again on this lovely southern california evening .
"as you might have guessed if you 've been paying attention , i 'm enjoying another <UNK> shake , courtesy of the lovely <UNK> ."
"i 'm kind of stuffed in the middle of the crowd tonight , as both the corner and bar are <UNK> ."
it actually feels as <UNK> as a cross country <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flight .
"it 's not , of course , being that i 'm not burning someone 's elbow with my cigarette ."
i get to fly the very <UNK> urllink jet blue to the <UNK> of new jersey this coming wednesday evening .
"the moment i touch down , the street price of a pack of righteous smokes <UNK> ."
when i get to jersey a <UNK> of <UNK> runs a bargain minimum of <#> <UNK> .
"no , really , go urllink here <UNK> ."
"i smoked <UNK> ( <UNK> ) for <#> years , until i decided in a fit of <UNK> to quit ."
"when i inevitably <UNK> <UNK> , i had the wacky idea to change <UNK> , and hit upon the idea of camel <UNK> ."
that lasted about <#> years ( the madness had to end ) until a wild hair told me to ask the <UNK> what else was worthwhile .
""" burns like a <UNK> , draws like a camel . "" or the other way around ."
"that was the pitch , and a buck cheaper ."
""" i bought a pack , and the rest is <UNK> blue history ."
if you click on the links above you will find that a <UNK> costs $ <#> .
"i now return you to your regularly scheduled programming , and i 'll return to my shake ."
"the problem was that he actually knows the language , and speaks as fast as a teenage girl on a new cellphone . """
""" as i shake my head in <UNK> ."
i did find out that he 's going to take a class to learn how to use the <UNK> thing .
i gave him ed 's phone number and email from his web site .
james got all excited when i showed him ed 's custom racing steering wheel .
"just for the <UNK> , here 's ed 's urllink site go urllink here to see his custom <UNK> to your own damn <UNK> hands steering wheel ."
it 's the round thing on the left .
"usually it 's at about <#> % , but lately it 's been <UNK> my screen at around <#> % ."
"i 'm at <#> % now , so finishing this post should be no problem ."
"the place is still half full , which is unusual , as after a <UNK> game it normally becomes a ghost town ."
maybe it being friday has something to do with it .
it 's always good to be friends with the security guard .
just so 's i can continue to be friends with him i 'll stop blogging about him now cause he 's sitting right next to me . later .
"i sat at the bar tonight , friday , as it 's damn crowded in here ."
"the mysterious <UNK> took my order , and , lo and behold , <UNK> delivered it with , "" there ."
that 's what a drink is supposed to look like .
""" i must agree , but , of course , i left the camera at home ."
the big girls are all wearing some version of <UNK> .
"she 's sporting the <UNK> again tonight , obviously <UNK> to see , but hitting the <UNK> <UNK> note on pitch ."
"tina , <UNK> that she is , is wearing a thick pink <UNK> belt about half the <UNK> of her <UNK> ."
"it 's <#> - <#> lakers v <UNK> , the game just started , all is right with the world ."
further update : <UNK> <UNK> is off the hook !
i 'm home again with a gut full of pizza .
the new kind from pizza hut with the <#> <UNK> that you can have all different ways .
i went to <UNK> 's this morning with ed .
ed is the white guy that goes to <UNK> 's in the morning ; i 'm the white guy that goes to <UNK> 's in the evening .
but we figured we could play a trick on the girls and see if they would mix us up .
"the last time we went together in the evening , ed had to take a ten minute break outside to hack the little black <UNK> out ."
"problem is , this morning ed almost <UNK> a neck muscle turning and <UNK> in the door at the girls ."
"i had grown accustomed to seeing <UNK> in the evenings , and then she up and disappeared ."
"she does not suffer fools , nor <UNK> - <UNK> , and i have left there with flesh wounds from a violent glance after questioning <#> of her drinks ."
"my new favorite , <UNK> , has pronounced that she will make my next drink , because the last <#> that i had , looked terrible ."
you can see a picture of it in a post below .
"before i left the other night she had noticed my camera , and i showed her the picture i took ."
"i promise that the moment i get her to pose for me , you will be , um , informed ."
"may as well spell check this thing , and to post ."
i 've decided to take the night off and stay at home .
but i do plan to watch the second half of the lakers game in a few minutes .
urllink here are the minnesota <UNK> dance team .
"chuck <UNK> , the urllink voice of jazz in l.a ."
i heard it on the radio on the way home from <UNK> 's last night .
here tonight i 'm working on some embarassing pictures of my friend mike 's wife washing my car .
"it goes without saying that she 'll never do it again , but it 's fun to make fun ."
this is also an experiment in my html skills to see if i can actually get these pictures to post on the blog .
they add a drop of blue and discover a new color that i have n't a clue .
"this is from a <UNK> , not a <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is in a black number with lace <UNK> on the shoulders and in <#> patches on the back and front of the bottom , very sexy ."
this is <UNK> nice because <UNK> is wearing the exact same outfit .
"i only call her that because she does n't speak a lick of english , and does n't appear that she wants to ."
she <UNK> presents a blank look as she walks by .
ed and i think that she 's a <UNK> from the old country .
i 'm also going to work on the short story tonight .
it looks like i applied some kind of <UNK> photoshop filter to it .
i just made it smaller than it was so it would load on the site faster .
"the lakers are losing in the second quarter , although they are only down by ten now instead of the <#> they were in the first ."
"tee is wearing glasses tonight , and has that sexy <UNK> vibe going on ."
"it ’s a decent crowd for a monday , girls are here with their dates and boss lady looks happy ."
"i just posted to my other site some thoughts about the spanish elections and the <UNK> a few days ago , and my brain hurts ."
"i just want to <UNK> out and not think about bug things , but the damn world <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> girls are wearing some kind of black and gold outfit that i don’t remember seeing before , and i approve ."
i wish the guys would get their act together as well .
they look like this is the first quarter of a pickup game and <UNK> never played together before .
"<UNK> looks awesome just being on the floor though , and i can’t wait to see this team in the playoffs ."
"i’m going to post this crap now , and take care of some email , and then watch the rest of the game ."
come back tomorrow and you’ll see more of the same .
"this is the second installment of hack <UNK> , and it has a good <UNK> , though you can’t see it ."
boss lady just came by and <UNK> my shoulder and said again she likes my computer .
i can still smell her perfume a full minute after she left . and that ’s a good thing .
"boss lady is easily a beauty <UNK> winner , and she <UNK> like a pro ."
you fella ’s out there that like asian women would seriously be feeling good right now if <UNK> was just <UNK> your shoulder .
there ’s also new talent here tonight and i’ll have to find out her name .
"my waitress for the evening will be <UNK> , as she brought me my <UNK> shake and poured tea ."
"she also reminded me not to spill it , as i happened to knock a full pot off the table last night ."
it ’s her way of showing me she ’s paying attention .
"tonight , maybe it ’s because of my location , everybody seems to want to see what i’m writing ."
they will have to stop and stare though because i’ve got the type set small enough that a quick drive - by <UNK> gonna cut it .
they all seem to look ex - military to me .
"that is , the guys that i see in the coffee bars ."
"they’re all kind of big with short <UNK> and serious expressions , intent on low conversations or <UNK> <UNK> the jazz game on the tube ."
ed says that most of the girls when they first see a white guy come in here that they think he ’s a cop .
"nobody in their right mind would think of me as a cop , even though i work hard on my now <UNK> pot belly ."
i had it going there for a while to the point that i could fool small children into thinking that i was pregnant .
my few months of <UNK> as a strike <UNK> at the local ralph ’s had me on my feet for more hours a day than i’ve seen since <#> .
that and the fact that i worked in the produce department had me eating fresh fruit instead of <UNK> has ruined me for the <UNK> future .
"now i live on a diet of coffee and the rocket fuel that they serve here at <UNK> ’s , as well as the occasional fruit based <UNK> ."
"another food item that i’d have never thought of stuffing into my face until i got to california , and then i couldn’t avoid it . and tea ."
i drink way too much of this chinese tea that they serve here .
last night i <UNK> my rocket fuel all night and went through <#> pots of tea .
"including most of <#> that went on the floor , but still ."
"at the tender age of <#> - <#> , i still haven’t figured out that coffee keeps me awake ."
i’m going to screw around with the template here on blogger and see if i can get the email address on the sidebar .
"the fuckers at hotmail decided that hack <UNK> was out of <UNK> for an address , seemingly as hack is a dirty word ."
"so we’ve got <UNK> - <UNK> , as that was the only <UNK> i could come up with without timing out on the registration process ."
"i expect that this will cause problems for some people interested enough to email me , thanks microsoft ."
"welcome to my new blog that is totally irrelevant in the big scheme of things , and i 'm comfortable with that ."
it 's about my mostly daily visits to a <UNK> style coffee bar in southern california and my attempts to hack out some kind of writing project .
"he loses the money to the <UNK> or some such , and winds up hacking out crap for a <UNK> for the local <UNK> ."
i know i 'm ruining it as now i 'll have in the back of my mind that someone might stumble across it and actually read it .
"but at least for the first post , it 's not edited , and i wrote it before i decided to post it ."
"relaxing saturday night at <UNK> ’s . waiting for the red <UNK> for that first sentence from the grammar <UNK> at microsoft , and it doesn’t appear ."
"the music is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , not quite annoying , but close ."
i’m already having a craving for a wendy ’s burger .
"the girls are in their whites tonight , and looking as lovely as ever ."
"it ’s not so busy , and tea asked if it ’s normally like this on saturdays ."
i forget that i’ve now been coming here as long as or longer than <#> of the girls have worked here .
looking back to the first thing i wrote it ’s <UNK> over a month .
"i wish i could get pictures to show you , but that ’s going to take a while ."
la daily news on the nba urllink shifting games around to squeeze the most broadcast money out of the lakers .
i’m going to have to make <#> of my daylight <UNK> to see if i can find who the it guru is .
some guys have <UNK> out my usual corner area of operation tonight .
i’m sitting right in the middle right in front of the big big screen tv and facing the opposite way from normal .
the big game on the tube is the kings v. <UNK> .
"i don’t know where in the series they are , but it ’s got to be getting close ."
"at the half the kings are down by <#> , but they look good ."
dallas looks ok too and both teams are at a <UNK> plus pace .
he even has his own urllink blog !
the girls have the <UNK> <UNK> going on tonight .
little black dresses and matching <UNK> you may find at a cocktail party or a <UNK> .
even <UNK> has the attitude going on in her black dress .
"” i’m looking the other way , as i said , so i can’t get a look at the bar unless i turn around in my chair ."
it puts a real <UNK> in my <UNK> style .
"i just <UNK> my neck and came into direct eye contact with <UNK> leaning on the bar , so i <UNK> at her and set her off laughing ."
i’ll prefer to think that that was a good thing .
when she comes around again on the guitar i’ll study her evening wear in a more measured manner .
"so far i can only tell that it ’s a short dress with an interesting pattern , kind of modern art - ish and well <UNK> ."
"the place is crowded around the main tv areas tonight , and rather <UNK> around the edges ."
"i could probably now go stake a claim in the corner <UNK> to my regular haunt , but it ’s <#> of those corners that never get served ."
"it ’s a corner for plans and conspiracy , properly used by <UNK> types to dream up <UNK> of <UNK> and world <UNK> ."
"i’ve learned though , the hard way , that conspiracy requires <UNK> , and they are usually the <UNK> of any plan , no matter how well laid ."
"it ’s about a guy that gets involved with a coffee girl against his better judgment , and , well , i don’t know exactly yet ."
update : <#> - <#> sack - o - tomatoes .
the <UNK> scored only <#> points in the third quarter .
they were up by <#> after both the first quarter and at the half .
"after being charged with a foul that he didn’t think he deserved , bruce banner would have been proud ."
he damn near ripped off his own uniform and let out a scream at heaven itself .
"so no talent report , sorry , i know you’re bummed ."
he just passed larry bird on the all time <UNK> list for most points scored to take the number <#> position .
"kobe started the day in court in colorado , played <#> minutes and sat down ."
he has since put on a clinic and has <#> points and ten <UNK> as well as <#> <UNK> .
"next stop san antonio . watched all the post game stuff , and then caught the channel <#> news at <#> ."
"i’ve always thought that lauren <UNK> was smoking hot but , holy crap , it 's a regular babe - fest ."
second night in a row that i can’t get on the internet at <UNK> ’s .
"full signal and all that , just no network connection ."
"i’m even more bummed though , because my director friend was here until just moments ago with his laptop , and he was surfing away ."
i haven’t seen him in months as he ’s been working on a movie as director of photography using his new digital camera .
"all i do is click , and i’m on ."
it didn’t appear that he suffered too much .
i don’t even remember at this point if i uploaded last night ’s entry when i got home .
"he usually writes well enough , but this time it sucked , and i made the mistake of telling him so , minus the sugar ."
"i was up until <#> , and catching some real attitude ."
having opened my mouth i had to see it through until we had a good version .
i’ve also been working on a post for the other site for <#> days that was just not coming together .
"i needed to look up <UNK> for it , and not having internet access last night didn’t help ."
i’ve found that writing for the internet really sucks if you’re not connected .
"half of the fun is pointing out other sites , which means surfing and checking links ."
"but enough about me , who is working tonight ?"
"tee came over and asked , “ you want a shake , right ?"
” meaning do i want my coffee fuel straight with ice ( it ’s a hot day today ) or <UNK> ?
"“ i want coconut , ” which is what i usually have on hot days ."
"no really , it ’s ok , sorry , no problem , etc ."
tee is wearing a white <UNK> <UNK> dress tonight with peek - a - boo holes in the side above her waist .
it has gold trim and has a big gold bow tied behind her neck .
"needless to say it ’s short and sexy , and well worth the material that had to die in order for her to wear it ."
"she ’s sans glasses tonight and has done something special with her eye makeup , which is quite nice ."
"<UNK> is wearing <#> of my favorite dresses , for her ."
"it ’s a <UNK> - tooth dark gray and white , and also is a <UNK> ."
"this kind of outfit only works with really young and taught bodies , or with <UNK> breasts that have a tendency to stay put in the first place ."
"it was actually a longer exchange than the <#> i had with tee , and this time my director friend actually <UNK> in once or twice ."
she ’s tall and thin and reminds <#> of a single <UNK> of wheat <UNK> in a soft breeze . but with a sweet rack .
<UNK> out our staff this evening is a relatively new girl whose name i haven’t gotten yet .
"i’ve seen her around a couple of times , but not all the time ."
she might come from the day crew or just be part time .
"there are tight outfits , and then there are tight outfits ."
the <#> that she is wearing is <#> of the latter .
the most <UNK> of which is a sweet round belly .
most all of the girls here have <UNK> as opposed to <UNK> .
"they are tight , flat , defined ; <UNK> with the body into the hips and booty well enough , but typical of youth or an expensive gym membership ."
i swear i don’t know how they do it .
she ’s also wearing a pink <UNK> on her left hip that seems to be enjoying the ride .
"a couple of weeks ago , as i was coming out of my <UNK> i realized that all of my <UNK> weren’t showing the same time ."
i had missed the <UNK> to daylight savings time .
"some of them , had changed automatically , so for at least a couple of days things didn’t always make sense ."
i missed episodes from my <#> favorite tv shows that week in the confusion .
the <UNK> and t - wolves are on the tube here at the <UNK> tonight .
"i’m guessing game <#> , but the <UNK> on - screen graphic isn’t giving me a clue ."
"i take that back now , minnesota just stole the ball and are up by <#> points in the fourth quarter ."
<UNK> is sitting on the bench as i write this .
"when i first looked up i noticed him on the floor , and he looked like he was hanging around the <UNK> ."
i noticed because i’ve seen him play live before .
a good year or <#> before he attempted to <UNK> his coach and was <UNK> to the ny
<UNK> i remember thinking of him as a big cat .
he played close to the floor with long legs and long arms and seemed to run circles around some of the other players .
his movement was fluid and he was the fastest player on the pine .
"problem is , he has to make the shot ."
"we’re down to <#> girls and less than <#> minutes in the fourth , and this post is beyond long ."
i’ll post the final score before i upload .
update : i never did upload last night ’s post .
"i have a full signal on the old wireless <UNK> , but i can’t connect to the internet ."
"so something is <UNK> in the back where they make the donuts , er , <UNK> , er , shakes ."
"no matter , i can still write and post later ."
"“ pete , ” ( please imagine thick <UNK> accent ) “ are you coming today ?"
"the night before , the last words from <UNK> were , “ will you be here tomorrow ?"
"i had planned to be here anyway , but during the day , to watch the lakers ."
"she works nights , so i had been mentally <UNK> my schedule for the day to at least get an <UNK> of her shift in ."
"a woman like <UNK> asks if you’re going to be around , you answer"
"“ hi <UNK> , i just got up . ”"
"when are you coming , i have to make plans . ” “"
"i thought that you had no plans today , that ’s why i’m coming over . ”"
"“ i might have to go to the store , you know ."
i forgot the lakers were on in half an hour and got ready to drive over to san pedro .
it wasn’t until i was cursing the traffic in long beach that i remembered the game .
some radio <UNK> said we were going into half time up <#> points .
it had been so long since i’ve been to <UNK> ’s that i got lost for a minute .
couple of extra turns got me to the <UNK> entrance .
my guide kai got a little ahead of me and had to wait .
"after long lost <UNK> <UNK> showed me her current project , hand made <UNK> based on the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"that ’s all very nice <UNK> , would you excuse me for a moment ?"
the only good thing i can say about dial up internet is that it ’s slow .
that all changed when i was loading up an amazon z shop page and i caught the lakers walking off the floor after <UNK> with a tie score .
"<UNK> and <UNK> each had <#> <UNK> , and a bunch of others had <#> ."
we ordered pizza and cheesy bread and talked until <#> .
driving home i realized it was too late to go to <UNK> ’s .
"i thought about <UNK> , and realized that it was a good thing that i didn’t show up ."
"when she came over to my table tonight , i said i was sorry ."
"she said , “ that ’s ok , as long as you’re here tomorrow ."
stayed home and watched the lakers lose last night .
"it ’s ok , they were playing their first game of the series in houston ."
"next <#> they need to win , so as not to give those guys that little <UNK> of hope ."
"what ’s weird about watching the lakers , is <UNK> ."
"<UNK> just does what he does , and the ball goes in the <UNK> ."
in yesterday ’s game it seemed like he couldn’t sink a basket for his life .
along with his <UNK> low free throw percentage ( <#> for <#> for a <UNK> <#> % ) i wondered what was bugging him .
"then i go to the box score for the game and find that he led the lakers in scoring with <#> , and only <#> rocket scored higher ."
"that would be steve francis , which during the game looked like an <UNK> <UNK> on speed ."
"<UNK> had <#> total <UNK> , more than anyone else except karl <UNK> ."
"tomorrow ’s is a day game , so i’ll probably watch at home too , and you’ll probably hear about it here in the evening ."
"tonight i managed to get to the cafe before <#> <UNK> , even if i am a little <UNK> from my nap ."
"god gave us <UNK> , and even if you’re an atheist , you can still gain from the benefits thereof ."
"grocery girl kind of <UNK> forward when she walks , which makes it appear that her boobs are losing the fight with the <UNK> pull of gravity ."
it does make her butt stick out nicely though .
luckily for her she is that rare asian bird in that her booty provides plenty of <UNK> to keep her from doing <UNK> <UNK> .
"update on this part : just talked to grocery girl , and she ’s not the customer i thought she was ."
"until i find out her name though , <UNK> still be grocery girl ."
she stopped by to say hi and <UNK> at the screen to see what i was writing .
"discovering , or remembering this when your nose is <#> inches from a belly button is <#> of the more pleasant experiences ."
"the amazing tina is also here tonight , who is also <#> of those mad <UNK> scientific <UNK> in gravity ."
"she <UNK> the law by walking with shoulders back , a perfectly straight spine , and long , long legs ."
her face is perfectly composed until she <UNK> <#> of her slow smiles and briefly turns her head your way as she walks by .
it ’s a pure art form passed down through the centuries from <#> <UNK> beautiful creature to another .
"this being the weekend , the <UNK> is here behind the bar ."
"she needs to be an actress or model or something . or a rocket scientist , or .... something ."
she could enter politics and rule the world by the time she ’s <#>
"( unless she 's a republican , then add another ten years to round out her experience ) ."
you can tell she ’s going to look good long into her life .
"it ’s so weird to say this , but out of the group , she ’s the plain <#> ."
"<UNK> thinks of this as work , and she 's a worker ."
"she <UNK> it without complaint as if she 's raising a bunch of kids , and boys will be boys and"
the day - to - day is a given .
"saving the best for last , <UNK> is my waitress for the evening ."
"she hung out at my table for just that little bit longer than she needed to , and guessed my order , <UNK> me as a regular ."
"it ai n't cheers , and nobody but ed knows my name , but it 's still a good thing ."
"when i first started coming here , ed and i would discuss the various aspects of the employees , from <UNK> to <UNK> to attitude ."
"<UNK> , we thought was a bit stuck up , and stiff ."
"every step seemed measured , every hair was in place , emotion rarely flashed across her face , and dialogue was <UNK> ."
"she ’s <UNK> up in all of these aspects , especially in her walk , having <UNK> all of her <UNK> in the <UNK> process ."
"the <UNK> is gone from her shoulders , and her feet naturally follow <#> another instead of looking for imaginary <UNK> to place themselves in ."
"it 's a fluid , yet , <UNK> movement that says , "" i 'll get there , but i 'm enjoying the ride ."
""" it ’s nice to ride along and watch someone grow ."
"i 'm late again , got caught up in a twilight zone fest ."
"they managed to stretch the skit out to an hour , which was also , a bad thing ."
"the twilight zone was just a little <UNK> at times , but it mostly pulled it off ."
"by the time this turkey was over , i almost wished i had cut out earlier ."
"the <UNK> were hot though , which was not always the case with this show either ."
"it was almost like they avoided the <UNK> , or dressed them down , or made fun of them to <UNK> the artistic aspect ."
"this <#> was about <#> women <UNK> for a man 's <UNK> though , so they pulled out the old dark - haired bad <UNK> girl good <UNK> ."
"the best part about the dark haired <#> , was that it was pretty obvious that she was wearing a <UNK> ."
i know of lots of men who like their women to dress up and pretend .
is it that men like to be lied to ?
"back in the day , i enjoyed getting my buzz at the local go - go bar ."
"on the flip side , women do seem to like dressing up ."
what then is the reason for this <UNK> <UNK> behavior ?
"why do women like to dress up and pretend , and why do men enjoy it so much that they pay to experience it ?"
"i 'm sucking my shake down just a bit faster now , being that <UNK> <UNK> it off the table last night before i was finished with it ."
i 'll be keeping an eye on her if she comes too close before i 'm finished .
i 'll be keeping a close eye on her any time she comes close to the table .
"<UNK> has the <UNK> skirt going on tonight hung low on her hips , but she has a goofy <UNK> logo on her baby t - shirt ."
there are <#> groups of <UNK> looking like their going to tough it out tonight until official closing at eleven .
i see her damn near every night and she 's still able to be a <UNK> .
"she ’s wearing a light <UNK> pink , something like soft thin <UNK> , more girly and feminine than i’ve ever seen her wear ."
"she usually goes for da bomb sexy , and it changes everything ."
"her hair is falling , instead of having been teased into the wild child goddess distraction that it usually is ."
"actually , i can’t tell exactly what it is , which i’m guessing is the point ."
"it ’s just a confusing night at the cafe , again , which is exactly the point ."
"other ladies on hand tonight include <UNK> , who is wearing a tube top kind of <UNK> with clear plastic <UNK> which you can only see close up ."
"the top also has white <UNK> trim , which matches her short skirt that suggests a <UNK> <UNK> ."
"it ’s also <#> of those <UNK> <UNK> things that moves when she moves , and her short baby steps make it <UNK> in a satisfying fashion ."
"it ’s not <#> of her more <UNK> outfits , which is ok ."
she ’s got to let the other girls shine once in a while .
"her skirt is so tight though , that the idea of her <UNK> and falling off of her high heels <UNK> me . that she has slim hips"
"finally , <UNK> from the day crew is here as well ."
"of course everyone here is <#> to <#> inches taller than they really are , it ’s a group - <UNK> act ."
<UNK> ’s long hair <UNK> her length so that she looks more like a <UNK> fashion drawing than a real live woman .
and then it ’s good . because she speaks english and
"you can get the fantasy going that you could talk to her , if you only had something interesting to say ."
"but face it , unless the your first sentence includes a reference to your <UNK> , or at least a <UNK> , you don’t really have anything to say ."
there ’s no <UNK> game tonight and the music isn’t so loud that your <UNK> <UNK> .
"a lot of guys are playing <UNK> or just talking , everything is low key ."
some guys are just hanging out <UNK> throwing <UNK> at the tube .
i didn’t even know the heat were in the playoffs .
"i got here late tonight , and i’m already watching the girls clean up tables as a bunch of guys have just left ."
i’m feeling a little guilty watching them wipe down the tables because of an email my friend <UNK> sent me today from a <#> magazine called “ <UNK> monthly .
” among its many suggestions to ‘ <UNK> <UNK> is : “ <#> .
make <#> last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives .
"” as well as with other worthy suggestions such as , “ <#> ."
take <#> minutes to rest so you 'll be refreshed when he arrives .
"touch up your make - up , put a <UNK> in your hair and be fresh - looking ."
he has just been with alot of work - weary people .
"of course , <UNK> took me seriously , maybe because i’ve been spending my time at a place that puts an emphasis on pleasing an <UNK> male <UNK> ."
i had to set the record straight to <UNK> .
she then wrote back that another male friend of ours had replied to her original email with the same response i had .
"that ’s all from the western front this evening , and all the best to you and yours ."
i’ve been practicing my typing on a new program called urllink master key .
"if you think writing is tough and you can type <#> words per minute , you <UNK> shit ."
"i’m <UNK> out at <#> <UNK> , and i’m not even up to using the whole keyboard yet ."
"in other words , my brain is <#> or <#> topics ahead and as i’m <UNK> mistakes , my <UNK> brain goes off in another direction ."
"what sucks worse is that i have to use a spell <UNK> , and just editing spelling mistakes takes up half the time it takes to post this crap ."
"smart <UNK> which don’t translate to either blogger or mt , and i have to add links afterwards , when i post ."
i need some excuse now for not posting every day .
"<#> girls that i recognize from the day shift are on tonight , plus a new girl , and i think the place has <UNK> lost <#> pounds ."
"the new girl has hips , and she hasn’t figured the place out yet ."
"she ’s still walking self <UNK> , stiff , but like all the new girls , she smiles a lot ."
"not <UNK> yet , and still probably wondering what the hell is going on ."
"she seems to get along with the other girls ; nobody is ignoring her , as i’ve seen more than once ."
"women can be vicious , and when they ignore the new girl , it ’s not a pretty sight ."
"i’m early tonight , got here about 6:30 , and the place is filling up for the urllink lakers game ."
"san antonio seems to be beating the crap out of the urllink <UNK> , but it ’s a low scoring game ."
"the last <UNK> game was a similarly low scoring game , and it was ugly ."
"nobody could make a basket , and it was only won by <#> point ."
if they don’t come out and play tonight i’m <UNK> for the urllink <UNK> .
the team that was put together last year should have chased all the other teams home by the all star game .
"in reality , they look like ghosts on the floor , which is a pretty good trick for a bunch of black guys ( sorry <UNK> , luke ) ."
"what ’s interesting tonight is that <UNK> turned the <UNK> pop off , and the sound on the tube is up ."
update : it looks like both teams showed up .
<UNK> and <UNK> are starting to earn their keep .
"update : <#> - <#> lakers , third quarter ."
"the <UNK> are playing pretty well , but the looks on the faces of the lakers are begining to look like those of the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"final update : <#> - <#> <UNK> , with <UNK> of garbage time"
"nice touch , <UNK> getting into the <UNK> groove , and <UNK> rush with some confident <#> <UNK> that <UNK> well for the rest of the series ."
"it 's getting late here at <UNK> 's , 11:30 or so , and i 'm about ready to leave ."
"i spent most of the evening editing pictures for the <UNK> site and i 've just run out of time , so here is the link ."
"it 's just a little photo essay about my trip back east , but mostly about the time i spent underground in nyc <UNK> the trains ."
"i’m out on the patio , around 1:30 pm on thursday , tax day , and i’m still just a little <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> - fi signal isn’t that strong , and in order to post this i’m gonna have to go inside ."
"my waitress <UNK> confusion when i asked her for a <UNK> shake , so i told her to make me a shake identical to the last <#> she made ."
"it is a sweet , pink lemonade - ice <UNK> <UNK> up with more than enough sugar to keep me <UNK> into the evening ."
"i spent a week on my back , <UNK> and sweating <UNK> , eating virtually nothing , and wondering , what the fuck ?"
"after a week of this i got some strength back , and started to eat ."
"at the same time i obtained a dozen or so <#> <UNK> <UNK> and started a <UNK> of <#> a day , just in case ."
"i figured if they’re good enough for <UNK> , they’re good enough for whatever bug had a hold of me ."
i ventured outside the other day to wash my car to get the jet <UNK> off of it from sitting a week at the airport .
like today it was <#> of those “ southern california days ” that <UNK> you to write home and tell everyone back east what <UNK> they are .
within <#> days of my return i was <UNK> .
"the only good thing that came out of my ‘ down <UNK> was that i read the first book of <UNK> <UNK> ’s new <UNK> series , urllink <UNK> ."
"that ’s all for today , i’ve got to catch up on other things , email among them , and thank you for your patience ."
"i 'm home now , that 's what matters ."
"got to see granny , the bro , and the crew at the old folks home ."
"there was <#> good day that was just like the beginning of autumn , the rest were cold , <UNK> , rainy , or all <#> ."
i got back a couple of days ago but had to go to l.a .
"yesterday morning i reached up into the <UNK> for more sugar for my coffee , and pulled the entire right side of my back out ."
i was laughing at myself between <UNK> of <UNK> pain because of the little noises i was making when i tried to move .
right now i 'm pretty sure the whole episode made me sick .
"to <UNK> things , it cost a fortune to dial up net <#> at the hotel ."
they wound up taking about $ <#> off the bill after they saw what happened .
"as i took the red eye flight i thought maybe , just maybe , i could sleep ."
"when i got to <UNK> , the battery was dead , and it wo n't hold a charge to this day ."
"i 'm on the backup battery which holds about a <#> % charge , and drops dead with no warning ."
"now that we 've got that out of the way , back to our regularly scheduled talent report ."
"tee , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <#> new girls ."
"i 've seen <#> of these new girls twice before , ( well not exactly new , is <UNK> ."
but i do n't know her name and only said ' hi ' to her for the first time tonight ) the other
"you could say that these girls are , uh , <UNK> ."
it 's amazing that they do n't fall over forward as they balance on their minimum <#> - inch heels .
"they are taller than i am , with the shoes ."
"the natural shape , and the fact that she actually <UNK> well without surgery ."
"i appreciate that a woman wants to put her best , er , foot forward . but when it all comes together naturally , it 's a beautiful thing ."
"later , if the power lasts long enough , i 'll <UNK> the walls for juice for the next time ."
"she 's <UNK> behind the bar now , scanning the crowd ."
she 's tall and thin and seems to have a personality .
"she is likely <UNK> , as i was just distracted by her hair falling around her breasts and trying to find the best place to rest ."
"<UNK> is working a full , curly <UNK> , hair pulled back from her face that shows she does n't need the hair to frame it ."
"serious as she does her job , all smiles when she looks you in the eyes ."
they are now first in the pacific division and the western conference .
this black thing with the white - ish writing .
"it almost looks like i meant it to look this way , instead of just the old cookie <UNK> thing - o - <UNK> ."
"i went for the coconut shake tonight , which was a nice change ."
except i <UNK> delivered my usual coffee shake instead .
"tonight is the first road test of my new battery , and i must say i’m impressed ."
"it ’s just about <#> pm and i got here at <#> , and we’re looking at <#> % juice left ."
what the hell have i been doing in the meantime ?
"well , just surfing , watching detroit beat up the <UNK> with a funny ending like the lakers yesterday ."
’s response to his non - call was to kick the ball into the stands after the <UNK> .
"i have to agree with the <UNK> on this <#> , as do my <UNK> at <UNK> who also had a good laugh ."
"there is a time for strategic <UNK> and the old <UNK> - a - <UNK> , but not every fucking time the ball passes the <UNK> line ."
"other than this minor <UNK> , <UNK> taken care of by the officials , these conference finals have been most enjoyable ."
"the lakers have started to be the team they are supposed to be , and the wolves aren’t giving up ."
"will face off in the finals , and it will be a brutal match ."
after the game here they put a <UNK> spears concert up on the big screens .
now she ’s in black shiny pants doing a janet jackson rip - off talking about nasty boys .
at least they’re not showing an <UNK> twins movie .
<UNK> ’s singing about not being a girl but not yet a woman or some crap and i’m about to either lose my mind or my lunch .
urllink this is what you 'll have to settle for tonight as i just accidentally deleted a few <#> words .
it was the last thing i copied onto the <UNK> .
"the title of the post ( if you can call that bold crap at the beginning a title , i need a new template )"
refers to how i 've just bought a new battery for my laptop .
now i 'm too wound up to go to bed .
so here are <#> links to follow without explanation to go along with the other <UNK> link above .
that 's all because i 've used up all my brain .
"update : ok , i 've changed the template and got the comments to work"
but i ca n't get the picture to load in the comments window .
urllink best review ever of a <UNK> game from the kansas city star :
"<UNK> magazine has an urllink interview with <UNK> <UNK> called ' you can hate me now , "" that 's worth a read for spree fans ."
he is going to have to do a better job in the fourth quarter in new jersey to make it back to detroit for game <#> .
<UNK> has had the good grace to win today and give the lakers and extra <#> days of rest .
"urllink howard <UNK> , staff writer for the l.a ."
's other white meat ) follows up on my saturday post : [ <UNK> !
"<UNK> . ] still , there were anxious moments down the stretch ."
<UNK> had <#> chances to hit momentum - changing <UNK> the kind that defined his career on this very court but he missed all <#> .
and <#> former <UNK> fans sighed with relief each time .
hack - a - <UNK> defense made its series debut with <UNK> left in the game when <UNK> wrapped up <UNK> in the lane .
"real - time blogging : al <UNK> , "" they 're bouncing off the walls here ! "" at the <UNK> game ."
"yes , i saw the glorious finish of game <#> , just barely ."
"as <UNK> threw up his prayer , i had to admit that he could not have been <UNK> any better ."
"we blew a <#> - point lead , but we’re in san antonio ."
"ed said , “ let ’s go , ” and we got up to leave ."
we stood by the door for what seemed like an hour .
"in the world of sports only <#> other team invites such hatred from their opposing team ’s fans , and that ’s the yankees ."
"i could see the anger in him <UNK> from the <UNK> of his fate , and that of the men who would share it with him ."
"crossing his hands <#> over the other in the t for time out , he rose and <UNK> the <UNK> ."
i looked in at the guys glued to their seats in da <UNK> .
"the ones that toy with you through <#> quarters , and then remember that they’re there to play <UNK> ."
time to put on the show for jack and penny and <UNK> .
certainly not this <UNK> collection of has - <UNK> and second <UNK> .
"i’m going to <UNK> here because i’m too lazy to look it up , but afterwards jackson said of the <UNK> play planned , “"
"i’ve seen thousands of these plays , drawn up hundreds myself , and out of all that maybe <#> worked ."
"teams have <UNK> , some good , some bad ."
the red sox have the curse of the babe .
"i know that kobe and <UNK> will be <UNK> , and <UNK> ’s the biggest target ."
"i stand in the doorway , held breath from <UNK> lungs <UNK> into my space <UNK> my ears and lifting the false ceiling <UNK> from their frames ."
welcome back me ! to my new home at <UNK> di <UNK> .
"it ’s a regular blogging delight to actually blog from a <UNK> again , instead of writing there without the benefit of being online and then <UNK> from home ."
"it really <UNK> my style , if in fact it is <UNK> ."
"i know , i know , what else is new ?"
an <UNK> . and asked for a tip to boot !
"being a <UNK> sensitive sort , i try to bone up on the local traditions ."
"as a matter of fact , my whole <UNK> to <UNK> coffee establishment society has been an experiment in , if you will , cross cultural <UNK> ."
you just don’t find this particular phenomenon in western society .
"there are also subtle differences between <UNK> , and the proper use of gossip ."
"alas , there is also the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> society ."
but of course i will have a treat if you wait till the end .
” i was taken by surprise and <UNK> handed over my <UNK> .
” last all muscle control of jaw as lips and tongue tried to speak without breath moving over voice box .
i was conscious enough to only give up a buck .
as mean <UNK> walked away little <UNK> <UNK> in my mind of a small <UNK> of girls <UNK> away not <#> feet from me with <UNK> <UNK> .
"ed came by moment later , and the only thing i could say was , “ they made me pay up front ."
” we looked around at the <UNK> slips on the other tables .
mean <UNK> came back and took ed ’s order .
i still don’t know if it hit him until she came back and asked him for money .
dark clouds <UNK> the game happening seemingly a mile away on the big screens .
the <UNK> and chef chased my girlfriend and me to the cashier and yelled until i explained the bad service .
"no , i didn’t have to pay ) ."
we immediately <UNK> to <UNK> da <UNK> for the remainder of the <UNK> the lakers served up the <UNK> .
the bloom came off the <UNK> <UNK> rose as the <UNK> <UNK> to our bruised and <UNK> <UNK> .
"but the best revenge is served , uh , however you can get it ."
"on the way in the door to da <UNK> , we <UNK> ran into miss tina , <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> ."
she was shocked and embarrassed at our rough treatment at the hands of the day crew .
"<UNK> was had by all as we realized , “"
"” it also has a <UNK> internet connection , and the girls are <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> ’s has a certain old world charm , but sometimes having modern <UNK> <UNK> the romance of sweating whilst enjoying the scenery ."
already the conversation level has increased and <UNK> will be reading this post as soon as i post it .
"yes , i am insane , but maybe it will also raise the level of <UNK> here at the ‘ <UNK> past the usual <UNK> of the talent report ."
the <UNK> report will continue as long as they continue to actually play basketball .
"now , as promised , here is your treat for <UNK> through this far . in my last entry"
i mentioned i was going to assist ed for a photo shoot at <UNK> <UNK> ( i blogged that on the other site urllink here . )
that morning we stopped for coffee at <UNK> ’s and a couple of the girls agreed that i could take photos .
i only had my <UNK> with me but i clicked away until ed <UNK> me to stop .
actually he said stop stupid before we get thrown out .
as the sun <UNK> in to play its warm rays on our <UNK> hack - reporter he witnesses a ritual rarely seen by mere <UNK> .
<#> sleepy coffee girls preparing for a day of charm and grace amidst the <UNK> of harbor <UNK> .
"<UNK> <UNK> is what they call the costumes , traditional <UNK> ."
"long <UNK> high collar tops that fall down to the <UNK> , but are <UNK> up the side to the waist ."
not the <#> - ups - <UNK> of wearing the <UNK> outfit .
"they’re all sexy , and the costumes seem to fit all of the different body types ."
"tina ’s long jet - black hair is the most striking contrast tonight , even though all the other girls except tee have long black hair ."
it ’s a full shade darker and at the same time brighter .
"the <UNK> is here tonight too , except that her outfit is <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"the shape of her body isn’t in doubt , but it allows your attention to be drawn to her perfect face ."
<UNK> ’s hair is relaxed tonight and she must be wearing <#> - inch heels .
"the outfits with their long flowing lines <UNK> her figure naturally , and the heels <UNK> her legs into dangerous territory ."
"speaking of dangerous territory , <UNK> just swept her top around her and <UNK> on a chair right in front of me with her leg under her ."
the happy <UNK> shape of her <UNK> <UNK> at me froze my stare for a moment until i could force my way back to the keyboard .
nice <UNK> looks perfect the first time i’m seeing her in the official weekend uniform of the superb <UNK> <UNK> .
it must be brand new and hasn’t a <UNK> or <UNK> in it .
it ’s <UNK> perfectly for her and only the <UNK> ’s outfit <UNK> a <UNK> picture .
"tee , god love her , wears hers as if it ’s a t - shirt and jeans ."
"she seems to be so comfortable in it that instead of the outfit wearing her , she ’s made it her own ."
i’m drinking hot tea tonight which i’m realizing now is a mistake .
"it should be a no - <UNK> , right ?"
"<#> degrees in the <UNK> , maybe <#> degrees now , figure ice tea ."
"there ’s a rap song on the radio , hip - hop actually ."
"there ’s a real tune , rhythm and beat to it ."
i guess it ’s a universal nowadays that you’ll find this stuff everywhere you find young women .
i’ve even been caught tapping a toe to <UNK> .
but the hardcore <UNK> stuff gets right by me without a listen .
"last night i happened to hear a <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of , “"
"i looked around , and nobody was singing along , no <#> was tapping their feet , swinging to the rhythm ."
"it was as if this <UNK> celebration wasn’t really happening , yet there it was ."
i <UNK> the air myself and <UNK> only smoke .
"speaking of kobe ’s jump shot , the lakers will be on tape delay for me tomorrow as i have a real live working gig during the game ."
ed is coming back home from his <UNK> <UNK> trip and has thrown <UNK> to the wind to hire me as his assistant at <UNK> <UNK> .
"i haven’t been to a drag strip in over a decade , and i love the noise of the <UNK> and funny cars ."
i spent a few nights at <UNK> <UNK> in my youth watching the fire breathing jet cars scar the local <UNK> and <UNK> .
that may as well be on tape delay also as my task will be to feed the machines that make the money .
i do expect a spectacular show of skin though if the weather is anything like today ’s .
"i have n't done this in awhile , but the talent is amazing tonight ."
the big blonde american girl served me and is wearing what i think is called a <UNK> .
it 's black and goes with her tan well .
i told her she looks good and she then started to demonstrate by <UNK> herself why it does n't fit .
that was what i said when i picked my jaw up off the floor .
"michelle is wearing what <UNK> could be called a dress , except that it is lace see - through and she 's not wearing a bra ."
<UNK> stopped by and chatted briefly and i <UNK> her on her outstanding wardrobe choice .
"<UNK> , x - small , white , pink , blue , or <UNK> ."
"those are n't exactly sizes , at least all of them , but it 's now on record ."
"now i ask you , what could be more fun than buying some hot <UNK> and having a hot girl model it while serving exotic drinks ."
it goes without saying that it was beyond depressing that the lakers self - <UNK> .
"it also goes without saying that the pistons were awesome , and they deserve their title ."
"it also proves the old saw that "" there 's no such thing as a free lunch . """
getting <UNK> and <UNK> to take drastic cuts in pay did n't work out as planned .
"as <UNK> found out also , there is such a thing as destiny ."
"i do n't see <UNK> and kobe on the same squad , but then i was dead wrong before ."
"congrats to detroit not only on their win , but also on keeping the city urllink mostly in <#> piece after the game ."
"this evening i will do my duty and force myself to watch the lakers . watching this team can be <UNK> , as it was for game <#> ."
ed said that kobe looked like a guy facing <#> years behind bars .
we left <UNK> at the half because we were late and got the worst seats in the house .
we went back to ed 's studio to watch and cringe in private .
i saw matt ’s car in front of the place but i didn’t see him on the way to my seat .
but she did <UNK> chocolate syrup over it .
<UNK> hasn’t been by yet but michelle <UNK> at me when she went by .
last night i met ed for eats at the local <UNK> .
our waitress was incredibly cute and ed asked her what was her <UNK> .
"<UNK> it turns out , although she could have been anything from <UNK> to mexican to any number of south american <UNK> and beyond ."
after <UNK> we retired to the outdoor patio to drink coffee and so i could smoke .
it ’s good to remember which places provide a place for smoking here in so cal .
i’m pretty sure that i’ll see a real <UNK> in my lifetime .
it might be <UNK> the french language in some <UNK> in paris .
"the minute they take away the smokes the terrorists will have won anyway , so begging forgiveness from the <UNK> will be officially <UNK> ."
"anyway , back to our <UNK> <UNK> but incredibly cute ( she says “"
i know ” when we tell her she ’s good looking ) waitress .
she <UNK> when we said she could make more money as a coffee - girl instead of <UNK> <UNK> at a mexican chain restaurant .
we get the feeling that she has less than respect for our favorite servers .
her grand plan is to get her medical degree and open a free clinic .
sometimes it ’s fun to watch them crash and burn .
long - girl came by again to pour tea and noticed that the type on the laptop was very small .
what this meant is that she couldn’t read it as she walked behind me .
"i explained that that was the purpose , and she thought that it was amusing ."
i made the type larger and watched as she tried to read it .
<UNK> finally came by and asked how was my day .
"i actually told what it was like , in that i was supposed to do something that i blew off ."
that thing was to make a phone call to some <UNK> <UNK> artist in africa that i’m writing about urllink elsewhere .
"i want to set it up just right , and today wasn’t the day ."
part of my story to this guy is that my situation includes me being married to a <#> year - old girl .
that idea lasted a non - second or <#> .
"back to my version of reality , this post is long enough and i don’t want to spoil you ."
<UNK> <UNK> : the <UNK> tonight includes <UNK> .
buy it from here because it is required listening and i get a cut if you do so .
"king <UNK> is becoming my favorite sports writer , and i 've only read <#> of his columns ."
the pistons will get the chance after beating the <UNK> <#> - <#> tuesday night .
"and that was the score of the game , not just the series ."
the actual final score monday was <#> - <#> .
"i 've seen more scoring at a "" star trek "" convention , more good shots in the first <#> minutes of happy hour ."
"in <#> of my college classes , i made more <UNK> than the <#> teams combined to make monday , and <#> of those classes was held <UNK> ."
"everyone knows it , everyone gives out the same gasp every time ."
i had only <UNK> part of this universal knowledge before .
"i thought maybe , maybe i 'm imagining this ."
"then i began watching the games at the coffee bar , where even the local <UNK> <UNK> know the drill ."
"but the lakers do n't only <UNK> their own fans , they are brutal on opposing teams and their fans ."
phil jackson was quoted after game <#> about how he had heard laughter coming from the locker room before the game .
"he went in there and told the <UNK> to be more serious , and then they lost the game ."
<#> wonders how badly they would have beaten the wolves had he let them go out and have fun .
and that was part of the master 's <UNK> also .
he let the other side know how much the rank and file thought of their opponents .
on to the finals and detroit is bringing the ' <UNK> to la .
ed called from the dirty dog or some such <UNK> joint giving the play by play for the last minute <#> - <#> or so .
i think he had a couple of beers in him because he was excited beyond what was <UNK> for a mere eastern conference final game .
she proceeded to use the <UNK> for the entire hair cut .
"you coming down to <UNK> ? "" ed asks ."
""" nah , i had my afternoon shake already . """
i went home to pick up the <UNK> .
my roommate was now screening return of the king with enough volume to <UNK> the neighbors .
i must have pissed him off wandering back and forth in front of the tube checking on the charge .
finally it hit about <#> % and i headed south .
the <UNK> is getting louder by the day and the brakes are starting to <UNK> .
i need to get the other <#> speakers to fix that .
when it gets to the point of having to get a louder radio i 'll probably have to fix the other things too .
<UNK> keeps poking me in the back when she walks by .
she did n't notice me when i came in so michelle got me my drink .
"it 's my fault of course , i got a haircut and she did n't recognize me ."
"re : said haircut , i 'm now scratching my <UNK> neck ."
that 's the worst part of a brand new haircut .
they never seem to remember that i have a pair of glasses sitting on the counter right in front of them .
i wonder where i 'm going to get my ' <UNK> <UNK> for the finals .
matt and <UNK> have come and gone and the place is just starting to clear out .
if i do n't get some kind of creative <UNK> soon i 'm going to go back to the <UNK> talent report .
i had <UNK> them on covering an event in hollywood and instead of turning me down flat they invited me to write it up .
"anyway , it turned out pretty good and it 's right where they are <UNK> , so wish me luck ."
now i have to get back to putting something together for the local rag .
"but as <UNK> for not posting , i 've <UNK> the convention pictures to make them fit here on this old blog ."
"not for the <UNK> shy , and until blogger gets <#> of those fancy extended entry things , it 's all on the front page ."
"first up is the lovely <UNK> convention center right across the street from <UNK> , the happiest , etc ."
lots of peeps came to look at the cartoons ( that 's <UNK> for anime ) .
some peeps came dressed like their favorite movie heroes .
this girl is president of the <UNK> hills college anime club ( that 's japanese for cartoons ) .
"this girl may be too short for the nba , but here , she 's just right ."
he runs a web site that sells really neat things from japan .
you can click on the link over on the sidebar that says ' yellow fever . '
"or , you can just click urllink here ."
he is holding up a hello kitty item for sale .
"it is a , um , back <UNK> , yeah"
", that 's it , a back <UNK> ."
"i do n't know if you can see it real well , but this is a poster for the new <UNK> movie ."
"<UNK> is a blind traveling <UNK> , who is also a samurai . back in the days of the <UNK>"
( that 's a fancy word for samurai with no master )
"<UNK> were like doctors in japan , just like in europe <UNK> were like doctors ( <UNK> ' did n't know that ) ."
"i missed the american release of <UNK> because i was n't paying attention , now i have to wait for the damn dvd ."
here is another poster that i thought was pretty cool .
"i forget what it was for except that the movie is going to be released in japan real soon , which means it will get here next year ."
they had a booth that sold nothing but toys and stuff from the ' nightmare before christmas ' movie .
i guess we must like it pretty much too .
the most amusing thing i saw was this nice lady from <UNK> pictures .
she works in the marketing department and was getting in a little overtime to sit at the booth .
she had no idea what she was getting into with all the strange people in costumes and stuff .
i 'm guessing she 'll be looking into the anime end of the business soon .
"<UNK> is going to help <UNK> <UNK> actress , a big deal japanese anime movie here in the new world ."
"i got a cool poster but it 's all rolled up until i get it framed , so no picture ."
"as you may have gathered , some people like their anime very much ."
these beach towels are for those persons that would feel naked going for a dip without a cartoon girl by their side .
these are japanese style hanging posters that just need a <UNK> or a nail or something .
"the <#> on the right has characters from my favorite japanese tv cartoon , cowboy <UNK> ."
they 're all <UNK> <UNK> that live on mars in the future and drive <UNK> and stuff .
did i mention that it 's a cool show ?
the rest of the pictures are signs and <UNK> and stuff that were advertising <UNK> new anime tv shows and movies .
"there is going to be a <UNK> anime channel coming to america sometime in the near future , which should be pretty cool ."
"went to the anime <UNK> yesterday in <UNK> and took some pics of the <UNK> in another reality right here on good old planet <UNK> , uh , earth ."
"i met peter from j - list , <UNK> over there on the sidebar under urllink yellow fever , and various and <UNK> not so readily <UNK> peoples ."
"met a new white guy in di <UNK> tonight , mickey ."
"ed and i always joke about meeting other white guys at the <UNK> , threatening to throw them out so we can keep the numbers down ."
"the idea , of course is that we should try to make contact with the <UNK> customers to expand our ' <UNK> american ' <UNK> ."
of course mostly we just talk to the girls .
"i 've only met <#> creepy white guy so far , the rest have been ok ."
"mickey is pretty cool , a graphic designer and writer , and the girls seem to like him too ."
"he 's young , he 's committed no crime , he can stay ."
"they have <#> pages out of about <UNK> in english , and they 're looking for stories from ' <UNK> from the outside looking in on the <UNK> community ."
"the <UNK> are tuned to soccer , or as we say here , funny euro - football , <UNK> tonight with christina <UNK> videos ."
"you know , the spanish , french , <UNK> , dutch , and british ones ."
"here in the land of the free , we reject empire , and funny football , and <UNK> so ."
"we 've <UNK> japan with baseball , but only after , you know , the bomb and all that ."
we tried to do it with mcdonalds ' and disney but the <UNK> still manage to complain while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"then they send their best guys here , their local tv stations get to fly here and cover the games , expense accounts are <UNK> and everyone 's happy ."
is he calling for the <UNK> of the book ?
"according to the article , the kerry spokesman the says the <UNK> "" should consider "" <UNK> the book ."
he does n't call on the <UNK> to do so .
"of course , that 's not nearly as sexy sounding as <UNK> 's <UNK> headline , but hey , that 's the liberal media for you ."
update : there is now ( as of <UNK> est ) no reference at all to this story .
"here 's a little <UNK> on just how bad the bush administration wants to urllink screw working people , courtesy of the urllink <UNK> - <UNK> ."
why anyone in their right mind believes he 's for regular people is beyond me .
the big knock on kerry from democrats has been his near - silence regarding some of the more <UNK> and vicious critics on the right .
i really think this group is doing more long - term damage to <UNK> than they are to kerry .
... but i 'm sure it would just be the coke talking .
"the experts agree , urllink jesus would vote for kerry ."
( thanks to urllink drew <UNK> for the link )
"at least he said "" thank you "" at the end ."
rolling stone has a pretty good article on bill <UNK> urllink here .
the guy just <UNK> of a former high school nerd who now has the power to bully everyone else .
he 's getting <UNK> from the world for the way he was pushed around growing up .
i 'm surprised he does n't have a locker on his set to shove people into .
the urllink washington post ( <UNK> required ) has a pretty good look into just how <UNK> and fake these <UNK> sessions with the president really are .
"check it out : "" q on behalf of vietnam veterans -- and i served <#> tours over there -- we do support the president ."
""" let 's see , who 've we got here ? you got a question ? """
or is the <UNK> campaign just urllink <UNK> crazy ?
"okay , i honestly do n't know if this is the work of <UNK> bush on behalf of his brother 's <UNK> bid , but come on !"
an investigation no <#> will comment on that 's <UNK> older black people who just so happen to work as voter registration volunteers ?
are any of the major <UNK> even trying to find out what 's going on ?
"i mean , we know that they only gave a <UNK> glance to the fact that thousands of <UNK> voters were <UNK> from the rolls <UNK> last time around ."
can it possible be just a coincidence that all this is taking place in florida ?
"if you plan on heading to nyc during <UNK> week , please make sure you 've never publicly <UNK> with the urllink bush administration ."
so what does it say when the president 's <UNK> for cia <UNK> is trying to urllink <UNK> the kind of things
the thought that anyone might be able to track my every movement and possibly even control my vehicle from outside if they wanted to just kinda <UNK> me out .
"i 'm sure it 's made some people 's lives easier , but it 's still a little too big brother - ish , for me ."
"on an unrelated note : a few people have started to email me and give me feedback on this ' blog , which is nice ."
that would go a long was towards making it seem like i 'm not just talking to myself here .
"for some reason , there are links to conservative ' blogs and writers at the top of this page ."
"this is a free ' blog service , so i guess they get to choose what they link from my page ."
i just think it 's kind of strange .
"at long last , they can stop urllink running ."
"yet again , bush urllink <UNK> an opportunity to <UNK> the <UNK> on the <UNK> attack ads ."
his friends in texas paid damn good money for them .
what really <UNK> me is why <UNK> continues to work for him .
"for all the <UNK> from the right on how strong they are on military , etc ."
", it 's amazing that they do n't seem to like actual soldiers very much ."
"well , maybe not really , but i still think he had the best set on tuesday 's finals ."
it does seem like the folks in the <UNK> calls got <UNK> .
"in a way , i 'm almost glad gary did n't win ."
gary 's a good guy and a damn fine comic .
"at any rate , congrats to urllink john <UNK> ."
who the hell voted for urllink this guy ( thanks to urllink eric <UNK> for the link ) ?
why does n't the <UNK> just admit that they are a <UNK> - owned <UNK> of the <UNK> industry ?
people have been asking me lately why i 'm always so tired .
urllink <UNK> is n't quite as relaxing as the sounds of the ocean .
just entering this in order to prove i can update more often than urllink the <UNK> tim <UNK> .
i 'm sure he 'll reply with a comment about having a <UNK> life or something .
"the test post apparently worked , so now i start posting in <UNK> . welcome to my new ' blog ."
i used to have ( actually i still have ) another ' blog - like site that you can still read here : urllink <UNK> .
"as you can see from that page , i 'm a real <UNK> for <UNK> , thought - <UNK> updates ."
"this will be a combination of personal observation and political commentary , <UNK> with what i hope will be sharp , pointed comedy ."
something you 'll notice as you read my posts is that i 'm rather left - leaning .
"well , it certainly does n't mean what talk radio would like you to believe it means ."
"unfortunately , a lot of the time , we take the <UNK> ."
the <#> thing i can promise you about this board is that you 'll know i believe something when i tell you i do .
nevermind what rush and <UNK> and <UNK> tell you .
"when i say something , that 's when you know ."
i also promise to call bullshit when i see it from my own party .
"so there you go , about as much of a <UNK> as i could muster at this point ."
"i 'll prolly change my mind more than once , but it 's my damn ' blog , so i can do what i want ."
