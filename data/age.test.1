california will be another adventure on my life 's road .
i 'll keep you posted on how it goes . :-)
the distance from <UNK> to <UNK> is around <#> miles .
i 've spent the past couple of hours <UNK> out my route west .
my earlier plans did not include the mile high city .
the past couple of times i 've driven through denver have been <UNK> for me .
"as shown in the map above , my earlier route included nights in salt lake city and las vegas ."
"as of right now , i think i 'm going to suck up the pain through denver so i can spend a couple nights in <UNK> , utah ."
i 'd like to check out <UNK> national park and give my new mountain bike a decent first ride off road .
<UNK> is only an hour and a half from <UNK> .
"however , if i do spend some time in <UNK> , the drive from <UNK> to <UNK> is <#> hours and <#> minutes ."
"obviously , i am taking this cleaning thing way too seriously ."
the items in the above photo were found behind my refrigerator .
"i wonder if that little mouse was a special , homemade gift by someone 's dearly loved grandma ."
i wonder if the <UNK> from my cleaning supplies are affecting my brain ...
"<UNK> , sara and kelly at the restaurant ."
"last night my friends , <UNK> and sara , took me out for a bon <UNK> dinner at a nice restaurant in <UNK> ."
sara expressed disappointment in me not posting a photo of her in my mr .
"( while at her home , i had taken several pictures and , as you can see from the post in question , only mr ."
i 've become somewhat of a <UNK> now that i have my blog .
"every time i go out , my camera <UNK> me ."
"sara 's comment <UNK> a few questions : <#> ) is my blog "" the place "" to be seen now ?"
forget the exclusive bars downtown where you have to lay down <#> figures for a bottle of champagne just to get into the joint .
kelly 's blog gets you seen by all the cool cats in town ! <#> )
have i gotten over my concerns of sharing photos and names of friends and family with the web world ?
i think i am still going to be somewhat <UNK> in this respect .
"no <#> <UNK> , but the <UNK> were "" no last names "" and "" just so there 's no way to trace us ."
""" i 'm sure if someone really wanted to track a person down , they 'd find a way ."
"i had mentioned at dinner that i felt like our conversation <UNK> an episode of "" sex and the city . """
"sara pointed out that we had n't been discussing "" sex , "" which was true ."
"but , now i 'm wondering ... with this blog , have i become a sort of carrie <UNK> , <UNK> about life and love in the city ?"
"when we discussed my blog with our server , he had asked if my blog was "" political ."
who knows what it will look like a month from now !
"no , james , not quite like the <#> in your bathroom ! :-)"
<UNK> - sara and mike 's <UNK> mountain dog - with <UNK> .
the hard water has made my toilet bowl very rusty .
"i 've tried <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> with little change in the bowl ."
i just do n't know if i have enough elbow grease to get the <UNK> out .
"my sister - in - law had mentioned something called "" bartender 's best friend "" to remove the <UNK> ."
"if you know of anything that will remove the <UNK> , send me an email asap !"
it 's finally gorgeous outside ( feels like ca ! ) and i 'm inside packing .
":-( yesterday , the <UNK> were behind schedule and showed up a half hour late ."
"surprisingly , they were able to load all of my stuff into the <UNK> van in <#> minutes ."
went out for thai food with my brother and his family last night .
went over to his place to play with the baby and watch some of the <UNK> ' game .
a bit stressed and anxious about the move ...
this post is very dull so i shall stop now .
"today 's the "" move my stuff into storage "" day ."
i 'm waiting for the rental place to open so i can get the <UNK> van .
"last night , i had <UNK> , <UNK> and a movie at mike and sara 's place ."
he 'll definitely keep me company on my way out west . according to his <UNK> ....
mr wonderful has been carefully developed with today 's modern woman in mind .
"he is complete with good looks , sense of style , <UNK> , charm , and is genuinely sincere ."

i 'll turn in here and ask directions .

i 'm wearing <UNK> and a sweatshirt with a big blanket wrapped around me as i write this .
the past few days have been <UNK> cold here in <UNK> .
in august it 's usually in the 80s with lots of humidity .
it 's been as low as the <UNK> at night .
i ca n't wait to be in sunny and warm california !
"hmmm , i 'm not really <UNK> , but today is friday , the 13th ."
i 've already mailed <#> boxes to my friend 's place in <UNK> .
now i 'm wondering if i should mail my yarn .
"i do n't like the idea , but not all decisions are easy to make ."
i think i may have to break down and buy that <UNK> roof <UNK> after all .
i wish i still had my <UNK> wagon !
it 's been another day of way too much caffeine .
i 'm on my second dr pepper right now .
"at least i 'll work off some of the <UNK> by playing tennis with my friend , julie , later on ."
"to give you a sense of the disaster area i am currently <UNK> , i 've included a couple photos of views from my desk ."
"but then i found blogger , and this seems much easier ."
"so , i 've been very busy packing and <UNK> my move from <UNK> to ca ."
"lots and lots to do , only a couple weeks to get it all done ."
my gorgeous black leather <UNK> sofa will be put into storage with several other things this saturday .
i 've hired <#> guys and a <UNK> van to help with the task .
still have the little details of finding a place to live and a job to work out .
documentary of how <#> people used dna test results to trace their <UNK> back to <UNK> in africa .
by peter j. roberts the <UNK> dna project was launched in june to support <UNK> research .
"the administrator , peter j. roberts , a <UNK> with heritage in <UNK> <UNK> , invites others with <UNK> <UNK> to join ."
early results of the project show that sharing the same <UNK> is not a guarantee of <UNK> .
peter ’s family from <UNK> <UNK> enjoys a legend that his great - great grandfather and <#> brothers <UNK> from <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> .
"despite this tale , peter continued to believe that all the roberts families in the <UNK> shared a common <UNK> back to about <#> ."
"when peter compared test results with another roberts from key west whose <UNK> is from <UNK> island via green turtle <UNK> , they found they were unrelated ."
it turns out peter ’s closest matches to date have <UNK> or scottish heritage .
"it can help identify an unknown <UNK> , such as <UNK> <UNK> 's husband ."
"his male <UNK> <UNK> carry his y - <UNK> signature , which passes virtually <UNK> from father to son ."
a match between <#> of his distant male <UNK> <UNK> will reveal his signature or <UNK> .
if his <UNK> is a close match with other <UNK> with <UNK> in south carolina then researchers would discover the family line that <UNK> married into .
"for example , an 18th century <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , is believed to have had <#> sons , benjamin and matthew ."
this is a significant result since about <#> to <#> percent of people do not have the father they believe is their father .
any other <UNK> who tests and is a close match to <UNK> 's <UNK> would confirm that he belongs to this same male line .
this project can also identify or provide clues of early <UNK> origin .
"to date , <UNK> and <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> have been identified for participants ."
"additional results may <UNK> other european ethnic groups such as <UNK> <UNK> or african groups such as <UNK> , <UNK> , or <UNK> ."
"when <UNK> , the project will also test a <UNK> ’s direct female line through <UNK> , which passes virtually <UNK> from a mother to her children ."
this test is less useful for <UNK> purposes because <UNK> rarely changes .
", however , there is a strong <UNK> that the woman lived at some time since its <UNK> in the <#> ’s ."
the challenge lies in learning who that <UNK> was because of the <UNK> changing of women ’s <UNK> with each generation .
"although discovering a match with another <UNK> may be a worry for some participants , they need not be concerned about their privacy ."
the small portion of the y - <UNK> under analysis contains no genes that relate to medical issues or that will be of interest to insurance companies .
"likewise , the area of the <UNK> that is tested does not provide enough information from which to draw any conclusions regarding medical issues ."
collecting a dna sample requires only a simple mouth <UNK> ; no blood or pain is involved .
the cost of the male - line y - <UNK> test is <UNK> and the female - line <UNK> test is <UNK> .
"since close relatives should receive the same test results , they may choose to share the cost to test <#> family member ."
this is a non - profit project and provides no financial benefit to anyone other than the testing company .
<UNK> for “ <UNK> dna ” will provide a link to the <UNK> dna project .
it can be reached directly at urllink <UNK> and additional information is available from peter j. roberts at <UNK> .
many of our early vital records for the <UNK> are <UNK> or lacking altogether .
dna testing is <#> tool that can close those <UNK> and support <UNK> research .
in most cases testing will provide much needed confirmation and <UNK> of what we already know about the history of <UNK> .
having personal evidence of how your family line fits into our rich history can prove <UNK> and quite rewarding .
"the guardian received a note recently from <#> peter j roberts , a <UNK> at georgia state university ."
roberts <UNK> his family back <#> generations in <UNK> <UNK> .
dna tests showed that the <#> were completely unrelated .
both men are involved in an <UNK> project at urllink
family t <UNK> dna testing can help find ' genetic cousins ' by comparing the results of as few as <#> people .
"according to <#> lab , males are able to see if another male is a <UNK> from their direct <UNK> line ."
women can determine which group they are part of based upon <UNK> through their <UNK> line .
you can determine relatives through <#> of your <#> great - grandparents by using dna testing .
these services work in <UNK> with existing <UNK> records and help you fill in the <UNK> where no records exist .
there are [ a ] lot of <UNK> sites on the web today .
urllink <UNK> is <#> of the better known .
and there are many black and white <UNK> ( not to mention those of mixed race ) who are actively pursuing their roots .
but dna testing is allowing some to get partial insight into who their <UNK> were and where they came from .
"for a few <#> dollars , a dna test is like the last piece of the puzzle to help people connect to their <UNK> . and"
"<#> thing is sure , the more you know about your family 's past , the more you want to know . """
well h and the kids were away last night and i had the place to myself .
"damn ! would nt you know it that my mom would call , and i would answer .... there goes my night to myself ."
it 's like she has freaking radar that <UNK> in on me whenever i have time alone .
"so not only does she pop over to "" drop something off "" , but then she looks at the tv and never moves her ass off the couch ."
if i had n't been so obviously watching the movie i would have turned it off just to get her to leave .
its like it has some damn hold over her .
she always talks about other people - as if they are the only life she knows .
she talks about other peoples problems and about other peoples experiences as though they are hers .
so she hung there for <#> hours - effectively using up my whole night - and did n't leave until almost <#> .
even then it was hard for her to pass by the tv without beginning to gaze at it <UNK> and stop walking .
i even told her h and the kids were coming back hoping that would <UNK> her to leave .
because once you go to sleep its like an instant before you wake up and have to go back to work .
this is part of why i am so distant from her .
i so do nt want to be as needy as sis that i went in the <UNK> opposite direction .
i always want to be on my own .
even when i 've been in the hospital for things like ....
oh i dunno <UNK> ... or similar - i just hate having people there with me .
the last time i was even glad to have h out of there .
if i were to get pregnant again i 'd probably say just drop me off at the front door and pick me up when i m ready to go lol
oh and i went back online yesterday . just to peek .
it 's been about a week i think .
gt caught me right away and then i got disconnected .
"as soon as i got back on , <UNK> caught me ."
i was so surprised to find out how much gt really liked me before i decided to leave chat .
i think he was really <UNK> for me .
"as for <UNK> , i knew he was just going kinda <UNK> - and i was worried that if i stayed on he 'd be too obsessed ."
but it was nice to talk with them both yesterday .
"i meant to take some "" things "" off the pc before it went in for service and i just did n't have the <UNK> ."
maybe i 'll try to hook it up tonight just in case it will work .
"if not , i 'll just have to take my chances that things do n't end up in the wrong hands ."
i have been eating like a pig pig pig pig ! ! !
not sure what 's causing it - and i wonder if its partly due to my switch from regular meds to generic .
no matter what people say its not all the same .
this morning i ate a fat egg salad sandwich that i picked up on the way to work .
man i m gonna get as fat as a <UNK> if i do n't cut it out .
"so i can <UNK> myself , drink lots of water , and <UNK> a lot to try to burn off all those extra calories i ve been consuming ."
really i do nt know what s been driving it except the need for instant <UNK> .
and the funny thing is that its not really all that <UNK> - not while i m eating and definitely not after i eat it .
i m just missing a few things that would give me long term satisfaction
so i m constantly looking for a quick fix .
i did just drink a <UNK> of <UNK> .
h was quite <UNK> for bits and pieces of it and naturally i did n't most things right .
however there were moments of <UNK> and anytime with mom - in - law was enjoyed as were times with my lil babies .
we did all take a <UNK> bike ride on sunday on an old <UNK> bed that had been converted into a bike trail .
"h started out bitching , went right into "" you <UNK> me "" and i let him have it ."
ok - fill me in - exactly when did that become grounds for being mad at your wife ?
anyway the bike ride was great and relaxing and very <UNK> and i think it was good for all of us .
the kids were a lil <UNK> <UNK> us last night to spend their last night with grandma before she heads back home .
"funny thing is that work always ends up ok and i know my children are in great care , so i should be able to not do that ."
well i keep working through it - trying to boost my own <UNK> so i can get over that stuff .
<UNK> in a tech college under the major of business development with emphasis on <UNK> management .
it will be so great to put some technical know how behind the on the job experience .
it will also make me much more <UNK> outside my own industry specific type of job .
"my <UNK> says that this is the time for me to <UNK> down , impress new people , get all that <UNK> of work done , etc ."
so i 'm pretty <UNK> about my decision to stop chatting .
it 's been really tough to not do it .
whenever i 'm in between projects or tasks i have this overwhelming urge to log on and chat about my day .
so i have logged in and watched in a room or <#> but that s it .
"the "" new people "" i think the <UNK> is talking about would be my new boss ."
"he starts next week and i have n't really had <#> for a <UNK> time , so i think this will be great ."
last week i <UNK> a ton of porn - how <UNK> i have a terrible virus on my computer too .
not that i think he 'd tell - but i do n't really want him to know .
how can a person feel passionate or sexy with a person who talks down to them and constantly <UNK> that he thinks he 's better than her ?
but i would n't take it that far .
"of course they only hear the bad stuff , but maybe i 'm just making excuses for him ?"
my <UNK> made a comment that our mom left our dad for our sake without regard for her own fears of being able to take care of us .
the thing about marriage is that it 's not just about love and passion .
marriage is about commitment and love and passion are a bonus .
"thankfully the love and passion come first in most cases , but in the long run its the commitment that matters ."
"they could do that as relative strangers , sign a contract , and in the process fall in love . but"
"if you leave in the middle , your partner has to start all over again trying to develop such a <UNK> and trust ."
that 's not an easy task and you promised you would be there in the first place .
<UNK> it would be better if such contracts were the norm and if love and/or passion could be <UNK> outside of the marriage .
okay maybe i m rambling but those are my thoughts right now .
peace to you all and i hope someday someone finds this and makes some comments .
"hey all , this here 's my first ( virgin ) post on my new blog ."
i just retired from messenger cuz i was so addicted to it that it was <UNK> up my work n life .
i guess i needed some other addiction to feed so here i am .
"usually keep my journal on <UNK> , but this seems more accessible ."
"the purpose , if anyone cares , is sometimes to vent , sometimes to express an opinion or to record an idea .... occasional <UNK> ."
maybe someone sometime might benefit personally from reading anything that goes on here - who knows .
i named the blog adult swim cuz i 'm not a teen or gen <UNK>
"n sometimes what i write might really only apply to working , settled , and sometimes <UNK> adults ."
i work in a human services kind of organization in neighborhood <UNK> and housing development in an <UNK> and <UNK> capacity .
it 's nasty cold today for august - only in the upper <#> 's low <#> 's - last week was plenty hot .
my weekly beach days are over cuz i 'm out of personal time - that really sucks - so i 'm back to the <#> day work week .
no more days off until the new year .
recently i 've become kind of addicted to chat .
"i 've chatted for several years regularly , but had <#> or <#> close friends that i chatted with daily for the last year and a half ."
that recently went south when <#> got busted for i m on the pc .
then i found that i could n't shake the habit - how weird .
i had to be talking to people all the time .... much to the <UNK> of my work .
today i called it <UNK> - told everyone i was n't coming around anymore and <UNK> it .
i 'm going to figure out how i can block it from ever being installed again .
it 's kind of a new start for me .
"so far , it has n't resulted in any great amount of work getting done , but i will get started today ."
my goal is to <UNK> my work and personal life so that every step from here on is a positive <#> in a positive direction .
just picked up a course <UNK> and <UNK> from a local college so i can get <UNK> in some classes and start to better my future .
"no , i do nt mean i could be in her position next ..."
i just mean she 's who i answer to .
"no , i m not at all <UNK> or assistant related ."
but i 've gotten about as far up the ladder as i can climb without a degree .
unfortunately its moved my office location about <#> hour from home so a lot of things have changed in my interaction with my kids .
"this year , they 'll be riding the bus ."
i barely knew what was going on at school by the time i got home .
that 's sort of my goal at this point .
i 'd also like to write a few books - shakespeare for children has always been my dream .
so maybe i 'll be able to monitor a few shakespeare classes to get a better grasp of it from the real plays on out .
i 'm gonna see what else i can do with this and move on to my work .
i promise all future blog posts will be much shorter .

"and it is high time that society learned to value their contributions . """
can you imagine this country without any mexican or other <UNK> ?
"for more information on the film and other mind - <UNK> alternative media , go to urllink <UNK> ."
i received a letter from my friend alice <UNK> .
she lost her <UNK> of <#> years in february .
bill <UNK> was killed on his morning bike ride .
he lived for <#> years as a servant to god and people .
"i never had the pleasure of meeting bill , but we knew about each other through alice ."
is there such a thing or concept as forever ?
"live on , alice , and celebrate bill 's life ."
"besides me , i wonder how many people has urllink <UNK> yi park 's cd work is love in prison ?"
marc dropped off <UNK> 's cd and <UNK> girl fish he had borrowed from me .
he said listening to the cd inspired him to write .
he said the way <UNK> made poetry so simple - talking about details of her life - he felt that he could write like that .
"marc said , "" it 's amazing what she 's doing . """
he called his mother and ordered <UNK> 's book of poetry urllink the temperature of this water .
urllink japanese men 's <UNK> team - <UNK> !
i give it a <UNK> the salad turned color and the <UNK> was mushy from <UNK> .
i decided to organize my letters so that i can send them home .
i treasure every letter my family and friends send me so i save them . as i was <UNK> through the letters
", i came across a letter from urllink <UNK> <UNK> ."
"in it , she promised me that after i get out of prison she 'll make her famous chinese chicken salad and cook a full <UNK> dinner for me ."
she also told me that i 'm a poet .
urllink the chinese women volleyball team smashed the american team .
my friend returned urllink how to get stupid white men out of office to me and asked for another book to read .
i gave him urllink <UNK> wood by <UNK> <UNK> .
"ever since my guardian angel <UNK> the book and sent it to me , it has passed through <#> <UNK> and <#> african american reader ."
i read an article from where that this lady named urllink catherine <UNK> started an organic <UNK> project in san <UNK> <UNK> .
the prisoners were able to grow different produces and give them to the community or sell them .
"the project allowed some prisoners to learn <UNK> skills , gave them a sense of accomplishment and <UNK> , and helped the community ."
"such a worthy project should be <UNK> in every prison , especially those located in rural areas ."
every prison has <UNK> land to <UNK> an organic garden .
"with the lack of jobs in every <UNK> prison , more than half of the <UNK> prisoners have nothing to do ."
creating space for organic gardens sounds like a winner to me .
i 'm looking for my friend alicia yang .
the last time i saw her was when she came to visit me in san <UNK> 's <UNK> visiting .
she always shows up when i 'm least expecting it and then <UNK> .
i worry about her and think of her often .
"she 's a beautiful , intelligent , and compassionate woman ."
"if anyone knows the <UNK> of alicia , please let her know that she is missed and loved by many of her friends , especially me ."
my co - worker handed me something he wrote and asked for feedback .
"the title of the short paragraph is "" a <UNK> 's introduction . "" it 's more like a self - promoting ad seeking female <UNK> ."
he 's been in prison for <#> and a half years on a <UNK> attempted murder sentence .
he got locked up when he was <#> and never had a meaningful relationship with a female .
"he had asked his friends over the years to hook him up with a friend , but they never came through for him ."
"with <#> years left before he <UNK> , he decided to seek for a female pen pal on his own ."
female <UNK> is something prisoners all long for .
sometimes people are able to develop meaningful relationship because love does not stop at the prison gates .
"of course , the chance of a female writing a stranger in prison just from reading his ad is slim , but not impossible ."
there is a lesson learned through all our connections with people .
"in the afternoon , i stepped out of the shower and heard someone call my name ."
"it 's <UNK> ( his nickname ) , a <UNK> - old african american ."
"he asked me , "" is he finished ? """
""" that dude in the shower , "" he whispered ."
he was referring to the african american homosexual who was <UNK> .
"so i said , "" oh , you mean that human being , the brother , fellow prisoner who 's in the shower ? """
"i want to shower before all the workers come back . """
""" <UNK> <#> open shower heads in there , "" i responded ."
""" i do n't want to go in there with him ."
""" you see , that 's the same way some people in society look at prisoners ."
lock them up and throw away the key .
"what is he going to do to you ? """
""" if he touches me , i 'll beat the shit out of him . """
<UNK> waited outside the shower until the homosexual got out .
they 're <UNK> between july <#> and july <#> .
"i believe the term "" <UNK> mail "" <UNK> in prison ."
"a week after my friend <UNK> visited me , i got her letter saying she was coming to see me ."
why is <UNK> mail so far behind when outgoing mail is normal ?
that 's because there 's a <UNK> of staff in the prison <UNK> .
there are approximately <#> prisoners in <UNK> prison .
there are only <#> people processing all <UNK> mail .
every letter must be opened and <UNK> before its delivery to the prisoner .
"granted not everyone out of the <#> gets a letter , but you can imagine the volume of mail the <UNK> has to process each day ."
"sometimes <#> or <#> out of the <#> staff call in sick , then everything gets backed up ."
the last time i checked it 's a violation of federal law to delay the delivery of mail more than <#> working days .
"a couple of years ago , the <UNK> general ordered the prison to process the mail on time ."
it got better for a couple of weeks .
then it 's back to the normal program .
during the holiday seasons it 's not <UNK> for someone to receive a greeting card <#> or <#> months late .
the reason the process of outgoing mail is normal is because the prison guards who work on first watch take care of it .
"first watch guards work from <#> hour to <#> hour . since they only sit around and count <#> times during the night ,"
part of their job is to process outgoing mail for the building they work in .
they <UNK> each letter before <UNK> it and putting it in a mail bag .
"well , at least the mail going out is on time ."
i stayed indoor to escape the <UNK> sun .
i <UNK> my rolled - up cotton blanket and pillow against the wall on my bed and kicked out <#> letters .
sunday is a good day to catch up on responding to the many letters i receive during the <UNK> .
i’ll have to pay someone to iron them for me .
"after being in prison for <#> years , you would think i’d learned how to iron ."
there was no need for me to learn how to iron because i can always pay someone to do it .
there are many people who don’t have family friends to support them .
they have to find a creative means to survive while in prison .
i don’t mind paying someone a dollar to iron a couple of shirts .
the sun is <UNK> and warming up as expected for any normal summer day .
what do the average people do on a gorgeous day ?
"bbq , picnic , shopping , hiking , go to the beach , do yard work , or just chilling ."
"for my sister , brother - in - law , and guardian angel , they visited me in prison ."
they were surprised at how smoothly they got <UNK> to see me this time .
it only took them an hour instead of <#> .
the first thing that came out of my sister ’s mouth was “ how come you’re skinny ?
” somehow i keep in hearing the same questions whenever my parents or sister see me .
they came to the conclusion that i’m skinny based on my appearance : a sharp face and small <UNK> .
how i wish i could just peel off on them so that they can see what i’m working with under my clothes !
if they could only see me through the <UNK> eyes of my peers who have seen me without my clothes .
they would ooh and ah with envy and <UNK> just like them .
"my legs , though strong , can use some work ."
believe me when i say i’m not skinny .
i enjoyed hours of quality time with my loved ones in a visiting room .
i have recently had to fill a few of these out for various jobs .
"they have statements that you need to agree to , disagree to , strongly agree to , etc ."
"statements like ; "" i find most people annoying "" and "" i think it 's ok to give my friends <UNK> <UNK> . """
"who would answer these in any way except the "" right "" way ?"
how much money have you stolen from <UNK> in the last year ?
"$ <#> , $ <UNK> , $ <UNK> , etc ..."
""" it 's more of a way to find out if you are rock - stupid , rather than a criminal ."
"but if you think you 're free , try walking into a <UNK> , and <UNK> on the cheese !"
"i read that "" normal "" people are doing so much to themselves now that they are becoming punk ."
this was in reference to girls with blond <UNK> in their hair .
"maybe green , or purple or black or red <UNK> ... but still , fashion is no indication of <UNK> ."
girls with hair - <UNK> and tattoos and piercings are just that : girls .
only when you talk to them can you determine what their social and political <UNK> are .
i can kick you way up into a tree .
i had an idea that i wanted to get some rain boots ; the tall ones that go up to your knees .
now all of the <UNK> fashion <UNK> have knee - high <UNK> for about $ <#> .
then i decided i would get a <UNK> ; i have n't had <#> since the third grade and they 're kind of a cool alternative to <UNK> .
<UNK> ... all the <UNK> <UNK> have decided that <UNK> are now cool too .
if only i could have <UNK> these things ahead of the curve and made some serious coin .
"i love <UNK> , and i used to love this band back when i was a kid ."
so <UNK> them and see what i mean .
"the name "" horrible rainbow "" is from the simpsons "" <UNK> "" episode ."
"i 've got <UNK> ! ! "" and throws the <UNK> in the faces of the ice - cream <UNK> <UNK> who are trying to <UNK> her ."
"<#> covers his eyes with his hands and screams , "" <UNK> !"
"all i can see is a horrible rainbow ! ! """
the banner on top of my blog page today was an opportunity to own a tea house <UNK> .
is there a reason why so many people are in credit card debt ?
having a house and <#> kids is an <UNK> cost .
""" i used to think just surviving was enough ."
like we are lucky to have what we have .
i do n't think wanting to <UNK> is very greedy anymore .
someone said that to me once and i still do n't know what it means .
i 've seen a lot of things lately having to do with isolated communities .
"i watched dances with wolves , where the idea of a society removed from "" civilization "" first <UNK> to me ."
"last night i saw big fish , and the town of <UNK> was full of dancing <UNK> people in pretty clothes and nice hair , and steve <UNK> !"
"then today i watched <UNK> , that horrid movie with <UNK> foster and <UNK> <UNK> and trees and her dead sister ."
"how did she look so clean , and have such shiny hair and white teeth ?"
my house is full of bugs but i smell good and have nice teeth .
"the outside world looks so <UNK> and rude , and hard . and it really is ."
it 's too much work and very little reward .
i had to find the <UNK> from a white rose bush .
"finding them , using them , lack of privacy or lack of <UNK> ."
"last night 's dream involved <UNK> , rabbits , pools of water and tokyo ."
"i said , "" this is like being in a <UNK> painting ! "" as i swept towards the door in a <UNK> of waves ."
"the family was there and stephanie 's mom was opening a tea or coffee house , with <UNK> and cakes ."
i think this is because i saw some of lost in translation on tv last night .
in the dream this was a big time - leap .
all there was to do was go bowling .
i find it <UNK> that <UNK> - <UNK> ever saw the light of day .
"that is did raises questions of our ability as a nation to protect speech , liberty and freedoms ."
"so were john <UNK> still with us , he could not run for senate and then also <UNK> his <UNK> and <UNK> <#> days prior to the election ."
effectively <UNK> down his business and making strong candidates think twice about putting their hat into the public arena .
those are just the people conservatives <UNK> since they worked hard to make a living and become <UNK> .
<UNK> has succeeded at that point and stupid conservatives want <UNK> to replace cheney on the ticket .
"in other news , now the <UNK> seems to be admitting <#> things : it is for kerry and makes a case against kerry ."
"last week , his campaign issued a statement saying he was in <UNK> but did not <UNK> a date ."
"with a cruising speed of <#> <UNK> , the boat could have reached the border in about <#> hours , but there is no <UNK> evidence it did so ."
"but although kerry 's <UNK> have <UNK> in raising doubts about his war record , they have failed to come up with sufficient evidence to prove him a liar ."
"i think the above does that <UNK> enough that they do n't have to "" prove "" him a liar ."
"update : this adds new meaning to the phrase "" vote early and often "" ."
<#> way to steal an election is to have many of your voters vote in ny and <UNK> .
"wow , did the <UNK> <UNK> this as common practice ?"
what elections official checks the <UNK> in <UNK> county and then double checks it in say ... north ny state ?
so the democrats have <UNK> license to cheat .

i plan to move them in a few weeks when it <UNK> down a little .

urllink sheet <UNK> for the home garden very interesting .
i think i will try this over in the corner where i want to plant a <UNK> tree .
my co - worker said that there will come a point at which my <UNK> will go away or at least die down .
i usually crave cookies or other carb loaded goodies .
"today my only snake was a package of <UNK> <UNK> , ( <#> carb ) , for my morning break and nothing but coffee for my afternoon break ."
i have to pat myself on the back for the dinner i made .
"<UNK> chicken , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> with onions , served with <UNK> ."
i read somewhere that foods like <UNK> and <UNK> help you lose weight .
another thing i 'm working on is getting to be earlier .
"i find that the longer i stay awake at night , i tend to snack ."
tonight i had dinner at a restaurant for the first time since starting the atkins diet again .
the fact that this particular has the best best garlic cheese bread did n't help matters .
i ignored the warm soft bread and filled up on a green <UNK> <UNK> salad .
"the salad was no substitute , but at least i have no guilt ."
"for lunch : i had an in n out burger ( protein style ) , and a diet coke ."
at the restaurant i had an <#> oz steak with veggies and shrimp .
i 've been on a diet since i was <#> . back then
"though i weighed about <#> lbs at the time , my body type and <UNK> made me appear larger than i was ."
"not to mention , i begin to develop fast wearing a "" c "" cup by junior high ."
"so far , the only <#> that ever showed results was atkins ."
"<#> years ago when i tried it , i lost <UNK> ."
there are only so many ways to prepare chicken .
back then people thought i was nuts with the low carb business .
"there were no low carb <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> ."
"now that everyone else has jumped on the low carb band - wagon , it should be much easier for me to stick to this lifestyle ."
"so i 'm doing it again , this time i will journal my eating habits , physical activity , etc ."
a friend suggested i blog my atkins diet experience .
here <UNK> .... the <UNK> / 1st <#> weeks for the next <#> weeks i can have no more than <#> <UNK> of carbs a day .
today i had <UNK> hot wings at kfc and a medium diet coke .
i know that the <UNK> on the hot wings went well beyond my daily <UNK> carb <UNK> .
a. i did really well at dinner having the honey mustard salad at <UNK> .
"it 's only <UNK> walked on the treadmill , <UNK> , for <#> minutes then rode the <UNK> bike for <#> more <UNK> will be a better day ."
"today : <UNK> weight : <UNK> , height : <UNK> , goal : <#>"
"now , i m not sure if this piece of physics actually works in reality , but i hope i never have to find out ;)"
i am however intrigued about the meaning of this particular dream .
"the music is very similar to <UNK> , but the female singer 's voice is not as strong as amy lee 's ."
"that being said , the combination of female and male vocals adds something extra to the sound ."
"from this cd the stand out tracks for me were when a dead man walks , <UNK> and cold heritage ."
"by the way , did i mention they were italian ?"
"do nt worry though , most of their songs are in english ;)"
i told my closest friends at work today about my decision to go for surgery .
they both thought i was nuts as they saw nothing wrong with my nose ( is it really all in my head ?
"hmm ) but they too have known me for <#> years now , so maybe they just see past my appearance too ."
do i need to have someone stay with me while i 'm recovering ?
how long do i need to take off from work ?
"i also realised that it might be an <UNK> moment to quit smoking , as after the surgery i will only be able to breath through my mouth ."
i 'm not sure i 'm <UNK> enough to breathe and smoke at the same time :) roll on september 2nd
so i can get some of the answers sorted out :)
"i took a big decision over the weekend , and acted upon it today , by <UNK> a <UNK> for <UNK> surgery for my nose ."
"i guess they do nt notice my facial features as being odd , as they only see their son and nothing else ."
"anyway , by the end of the year i could have a new , more <UNK> nose ."
<#> that does nt cause people to stare so much ( i hate being looked upon as some kind of freak ) .
"i first thought about surgery about <#> years ago , but now i feel its the right time , plus i can easily afford it now ."
and we set a new uk record for being <UNK> ( <#> games ) .
"ok , so this is not really part of my <#> songs , so i guess i really am blogging afterall ;)"
"from their latest album , film , there are <#> songs i just ca nt get out of my head ."
"they are "" front of "" and "" me , myself and i "" ."
"sonia <UNK> , the lead singer , has such an amazing and <UNK> voice ."
"ok , so i 'm a blogging <UNK> ... be gentle ."
"the reason i started this blog is based on a conversation with my friend rita , regarding the book "" <#> songs "" by nick <UNK> ."
"if it becomes as addictive as they say it does , i 'll continue to blog on other topics ... beware ;)"
tomorrow <UNK> i do n't think i can manage another <#> ...... <#> is plenty ... has anyone noticed how these days are just flying by ?
i <UNK> on lots of <UNK> on t - shirts bags and <UNK> last night ready for todays <UNK> the shop .
anyway - if i say so myself they look dam good . and its not raining . ....
well - it is the <UNK> ... who said it had to be sunny .
and the reason you 're reading this <UNK> ?
but the reason i 'm writing it ... and i ca n't guarantee i 'll keep it
other wise i could 've stayed anonymous and demanded money .
anyway - friday - off to the <UNK> trying to get people into my paintings which is hard cos i do n't really like people .....
so i suppose its like eating your <UNK> - something ya have to do .
o - and i do n't do capital letters <UNK> n i type .
well ...... don't expect too much in the way of postings - i usually keep my website updated with interesting things that are happening ... ....
<UNK> - visit my website urllink <UNK> - <UNK> and find out more about the pictures !
not that i knew what was going on right away .
it took an innocent comment by a friend to make me step back and take a look at my life from a different angle .
"it would be a temporary thing , from september to march and the only <UNK> would be working an afternoon shift ."
"it ’s to do the same position that i am doing now on an acting basis , but my current assignment is going to end in november ."
the only thing that i have to worry about is whether or not there is food in the <UNK> and <UNK> for her hair in the morning .
"he left <#> years ago , and still nobody has stepped up to take his place ."
"my daughter is grown , independent and <UNK> financially to the household ."
we’re more like roommates than mother and daughter .
my social life has <UNK> as my friends have found new relationships to take up their time .
oh they love to love me when it suits their needs .
i appreciate that it does provide me with a good deal of satisfaction .
i help people and that is a good fit for me .
i’m not the glue that holds the family together .
i allowed that to be my purpose for so many years that i ignored other things .
"when he left , my daughter ( who was already , in reality more important than him ) , became my only purpose ."
"she ’s an intelligent , confident young woman with goals and motivation ."
i’m very proud . but now what ? the guy that made the comment was probably afraid that i was making him my purpose .
"he <UNK> from that <UNK> that <UNK> most males , commitment <UNK> ."
i’ve been relatively happy with the casual arrangement that we have .
the only thing lacking is that it always appears to be only <#> sided .
it works when he is available and needs something and hardly ever the other way around .
i made the mistake of mentioning to him the possibility of my taking this job .
if i’m successful at the competition it would mean working <UNK> to <UNK> monday to friday .
he only seems to squeeze me in on the occasional <UNK> when he doesn’t have his son .
more and more the mother of his child is not able to look after him because her <UNK> job is so demanding .
he steps up to take advantage of the extra time with his son .
i understand that completely and have never questioned the fact that his son does and should come first .
"when my husband left , i chose not to become involved with anyone because i didn’t have the energy to share myself with anyone other than my daughter ."
or maybe i was just too emotionally drained by the demise of my <#> year marriage that i thought i couldn’t handle a relationship .
"in any event , i do understand that children are first ."
he immediately assumed that i was asking his permission to take the job .
"i decided to share the news with him , looking i suppose , for a <UNK> of sadness ."
"it would seem that after <#> years of getting together on average , once a week that the thought of my not being available was not an issue ."
just think of all the stuff you could do in the morning before you have to go to work .
"for what we have , we could still manage to get together occasionally because i’m usually home around noon ."
"i think it would be good for you , give you some purpose in your life . """
that was what the past <#> years <UNK> to .
"it was never meant to amount to anything , but i am only human and over time , i have grown quite fond or attached to him ."
i <UNK> at how easily men seem to be able to stay <UNK> .
"i always think that i am capable of this , but i’m not ."
"i can’t stop from <UNK> , because i do that naturally as well ."
"and when he needed that quality , he was very quick to call ."
i was there and i was the <#> he wanted .
i felt <UNK> that he would turn to me .
it <UNK> in my mind that he does consider me a good friend .
he has shared information with me that i’m sure some of his other friends don’t even know about .
""" i think you should go for <UNK> "" without any <UNK> ."
"it was like he was jumping at the opportunity to end "" our "" thing ."
"what more can be said , that he didn’t say in those few short sentences ."
but those words have had me thinking about it ever since .
now i’m determined to figure out what my purpose is .
does anyone ever really know or feel like they know what their purpose is ?
is this just a natural part of the transition that we go through when our children grow up and start to leave ?
those are some of the questions i’m left with .
"at least <#> thing is certain , i am in a transition and it ’s up to me to decide which way to go ."
"it ’s a grey , <UNK> , lazy sunday afternoon ."
i don’t really feel up to doing anything productive today .
"i do feel as guilty as hell about that , but not enough to change anything ."
yesterday i took my mom to visit my <UNK> ’s in <UNK> .
her parent ’s are elderly but in very good shape .
"my grandpa is <#> and my grandma is <#> ( or <#> or <#> , can’t remember ) ."
grandma is not as sharp as she used to be .
"he is lonely for conversation with people and grandma gets <UNK> by it , but more on this later ."
my mother has a terrible fear of being a passenger in a car .
her anxiety levels are unbelievable and start to <UNK> when the decision to make a road trip is made .
we were taking sammy ( her precious and once the dog i called my own ) along for the trip .
i haven’t decided if my mom makes him nervous or he makes her nervous .
"just imagine what impact that has on me , the <UNK> ."
the production of getting ready to leave started early .
"the first <#> was me with the <UNK> , to haul the big <UNK> of water , that i purchased last weekend , up to the apartment ."
i was alone and had to stop continuously to catch it as it started to slide off the side .
i managed to lose it completely on the ride up the elevator and it <UNK> head first into the elevator door just as we approached my floor .
"i forgot to mention that our intentions were to leave early in the morning . or should i say , early for me ."
i usually like to sleep in on the weekend .
"i don’t think that is unfair , after all , i am up at 5:30 every other day of the week ."
i did jump in the shower at 8:30 and immediately got ready to leave .
"when i walked in the apartment with the <UNK> of water , my mom was busy washing sammy ’s face and brushing the <UNK> out of his hair ."
"asking that question , i dropped the <UNK> of water and walked out the door without saying a word ."
", i grabbed my purse and started to say goodbye to melissa ."
"again , i wondered how critical fixing sammy ’s hair for the road trip was , but decided these thoughts were best left <UNK> ."
"yes , well the thought is what counts , isn’t it ?"
""" mom , you take him downstairs so that he can relieve himself , while i get the car and i’ll pick you up out the back . """
""" "" do we have any eggs ? """
""" i don’t know melissa , look in the fridge . """
""" i guess you don’t have time to bring some up from the store before you go do you ? """
"my look gave her the answer , but just to be sure i said "" no "" ."
"my mom , sammy and i left the apartment and headed down the hall ."
the look on her face <UNK> that she was ready for an afternoon nap .
i wasn’t going to let her get away with backing out of the trip .
i did hear about how late it was as we drove away though .
"of course , this would be my fault , for getting melissa some eggs and taking them up to her ."
it had nothing to do with <UNK> over the dog ’s appearance for his trip to grandpa ’s .
i explained that my clock in the car is set fast and rather than being
that ’s my trick to getting to work on time each day .
"doesn’t always work , because i usually remember that the clock is set fast ."
:o ) the drive was pretty quiet until i got onto the <UNK> from the <#> to the <#> .
"if i had been driving alone , i could have made that curve at <#> or <#> km easy ."
"but i was driving differently , <UNK> my mother ’s fear and trying to be as slow and easy i could ."
"in fact , i was even driving a different route than i would normally take ."
"rather than attempting the trip on the busy , fast , hair raising <#> , i opted for the more expensive , less driven route of the <#> ."
"it was a nice , boring and uneventful trip ."
"there is a <UNK> however , where the money - pit highway ends and you have to travel south to catch up with the <#> again ."
"at this point , on the other side of toronto , the <#> is not as busy as when you are travelling through the core ."
i wasn’t sure if i was ready for the <UNK> cries and screaming .
these are part of the deal when you drive a <UNK> passenger .
the sound effects make you want to <UNK> head - on into the guard <UNK> to miss whatever it is that you haven’t seen .
it was almost <UNK> when we arrived at the end of the <#> only to see that we were unable to turn south .
"our only option was to continue , straight ahead on highway <#> ."
"a <#> lane , black top that winds through little communities through the <UNK> ."
i forgot that my mother is nervous on <#> lane <UNK> as well .
the something just happened to be my car .
an hour and a half trip turned into <#> .
"not only was i tired , but i was very hungry ."
grandma and grandpa were mostly happy to see us .
"after the first hour , the conversation starts to <UNK> while everyone thinks of something to talk about ."
we usually spend a good part of it discussing how my grandma can’t hear anything because her hearing aids aren’t working properly .
<#> needs a new battery and the other <#> that does have a battery doesn’t appear to be turned on .
we know this by the <UNK> look on grandma ’s face during the conversation and the way she just smiles and <UNK> her head .
when she does catch what we are talking about she is very <UNK> and has intelligent comments to make .
"that is however , if she can raise her voice above my grandpa ’s ."
he is usually so anxious for conversation that he talks loudly above the rest and she usually gives up .
"<UNK> by the fish and chips that we bought after our arrival , and i could not keep my eyes open ."
i did open them when i heard my mom yelling something about me not spilling my pop .
"my grandma was concerned when she noticed me sitting in the chair , with a can of pop in my hand and my eyes closed ."
she was <UNK> to my grandpa that i would spill it .
they convinced me to lay down on grandma ’s bed and have a nap and so i did .
i easily drifted off into a deep sleep while the voices of my mom and grandpa <UNK> on and on and on .
"an hour later , i felt like a new person ."
i made the announcement and the <UNK> for the return trip began .
the trip home was only an hour and a half .
’s <UNK> we neither encountered any close calls or became a <UNK> .
i don’t really feel like doing anything at all today though .
"in memory of the black out from <#> , i decided to <UNK> my <UNK> of that day ."
and out of the <UNK> there came cursing and swearing as <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> of it all .
i’m writing this before we suffer another <UNK> albeit temporary <#> .
the <UNK> are <UNK> rolling <UNK> much like california endured .
i didn’t realize that california suffered a <UNK> recently .
"damn , why do they make a statement like that and then go onto the next topic without providing a little bit of background information ."
now i’m going to have to spend my time looking for the information .
your inside look at the <UNK> from the point of view of <#> ordinary canadian .
it was expected after a week off when our <UNK> are so high .
i really wanted to make a <UNK> in them .
my manager had just walked up to my desk with <#> of those cursed <UNK> .
this <#> from a fellow that had contacted his <UNK> ( member of parliament ) .
"so of course , that got higher priority than anything else ."
he was in the pile to be done although and may have gotten done in spite of his <UNK> the <UNK> .
further investigation although <UNK> that i was going to have to contact the employer to <UNK> some information .
i left a message tossed his file onto my ‘
call <UNK> rack and put my hand on the next file .
"the fans , <UNK> , <UNK> , computers , fell silent ."
the silence coupled with the darkness in our office was creepy .
other ’s cursed quietly but the sentiment was the same .
"how long will this last , shit i hope not <UNK> well , i’ll just stay however longer i need ."
i need to get these <UNK> can’t stand this .
voices raised and people <UNK> back and forth replaced the regular office noises quickly .
"but i would like everyone to pack up and head for home now , while it ’s still light outside ."
this could take awhile because i was on the telephone to the <UNK> ’s office when our power went out and theirs is out too .
this is not just something that is affecting only our building .
they have heard that the <UNK> downtown are not running .
"we’re women after all , we had the <UNK> to attend to , keys to <UNK> , you know what it ’s like ."
but we were good girl <UNK> and we stuck together on our journey to the underground parking garage .
i now know why i park directly across from the door to the <UNK> and elevator .
"the emergency lighting was very , very <UNK> , but it was lit up in the parking lobby that was directly across from my car ."
"before i got into my car and headed away , my good friend <UNK> gave me a piece of very good advice ."
""" ok , i will , thanks <UNK> ya tomorrow ! """
"shit , i guess i’m going to have to stay late tomorrow night instead ."
working overtime on a friday night and it won’t make not <#> bit of difference to anyone .
"but nobody will be sad for me as i sit at my desk in this cold , lonely tower of cubicle cells ."
"ok , well let ’s get the hell home before the friggin traffic gets worse ."
you <UNK> the traffic lights are out you are to treat each intersection as a <#> way stop .
"that means number <#> , bring your fucking car to a stop ."
"ahhhh , thanks buddy for blocking that lane , i’m outta <UNK> god , i’m through my first <UNK> ."
"oh well , i’m on my way , just going to remain patient ."
"it doesn’t matter how long it takes , i just don’t want to get smashed in a car accident ."
"should i just drive right there , or go home first and see if she ’s at home ?"
"hmmm , i should turn on the radio and see what ’s happening ."
shit what ’s that car <UNK> through that parking lot like that so fast for ?
they were saying that there were real <UNK> threats recently .
what a better way to bring a country to it ’s knees .
the radio <UNK> were trying to act encouraging as they informed the <UNK> that all of toronto was in a <UNK> situation .
"take your time as you head home , stop at all <UNK> without police directing traffic ."
the common sense <UNK> came steadily in place of the normal <UNK> <UNK> that is usual for this time of the day .
i feel so sorry for those poor people without it .
shit i wish i could get a hold of melissa .
i’m never gonna make it to the mall by <UNK> .
it ’s <UNK> now and i’m not even on the <UNK> yet .
"i wonder if i’m making the right decision going this way . """
"now we do not know the cause of the <UNK> yet and well , it ’s just better not to <UNK> at this point ."
"look at us in our little metal boxes <UNK> for the best lane , the <UNK> spot to get home ."
i just want to get home in <#> piece .
i’m not going to risk going to the mall for melissa .
they would have closed the mall when this hit .
"not too far now , i can see the exit from here ."
"oh my god , what about <UNK> , dennis , how are they getting home ."
"oh <UNK> , how could i forget they don’t have cars ."
"<UNK> could have come home with me , at least she would have been almost home that way ."
"oh my god , i wonder where they are …"
"i’m going to have to tell them tomorrow that the next time they should <UNK> so fucking <UNK> , i can’t remember who has a car and who doesn’t ."
"ok , <#> down , <#> to <UNK> we go , another <#> , and another , whew ."
now i’m staying put until i have to get off .
<UNK> there is no good lane on here tonight .
now why is that transport trying to come into this lane .
"too bad buddy , you want over here , get <UNK> , you stupid bitch , move up , don’t let him <UNK> ."
where did you get your license you stunned bitch ? out of a bubble gum machine ?
<UNK> <UNK> i’m actually doing <#> km ’s now .
damn now i know why people like <UNK> over standard shift .
goddamn <UNK> is a pain in the ass in stop and go traffic .
not as bad as i thought it would be .
now to get up <UNK> and through all those lights without incident .
it ’s not a nice world that we live in .
i just want to get <UNK> hope melissa is there .
should i try to drive over to the mall ?
"no , just go home , see if she is <UNK> hmmm , i dunno , damn i’m not going until somebody going the other way stops ."
"we could be here all <UNK> there thank you somebody with sense , stopping , going now , whew , made it ."
shit i can’t wait to park this car .
i let out a huge sigh of relief when i finally made it up the drive to my underground parking garage and my door <UNK> card actually worked .
it was really creepy inside though when the door closed .
"i park close to the doors where you enter and exit outside and once that door was shut , the <UNK> was very thick ."
i sat for a moment trying to get my eyes accustomed to the darkness before i stepped into it .
"<UNK> , fuck who would want to jump me ?"
"they would be in for a real surprise as i <UNK> them , <UNK> ."
"now , i wonder if the elevator is working ."
oh that ’s a good sign the light is on .
"i hear something moving up and down the <UNK> , <UNK> promising , i think it ’s coming , oh it <UNK> !"
the door opened and the elevator was filled with <#> men .
"the elevator stopped and <#> of the men <UNK> , leaving me with <#> ."
""" i know , but when i thought about climbing stairs or taking a chance on this , i figured i’d take the chance ."
"besides i know they always have an elevator that works on generator . """
""" yes but it won’t last forever ! """
"i smiled at him as the door opened at my floor . """
"well good luck , i hope you make it the rest of the way and have a pleasant evening ! """
i opened the door and could see that <UNK> was home already .
"about <#> minutes ago , she said <UNK> be here around 5:30 . """
i hope whoever is bringing her home is careful .
"not much longer , only <#> minutes and <UNK> be home ."
i should call my sister and see if she was out in <UNK>
i called my sister and mom to make sure that everyone was safe in their respective homes .
"of course , my mom was <UNK> about the situation and what was she going to do with sammy if the <UNK> weren’t working ?"
none of her concerns could be <UNK> by me or anyone else for that matter .
this was far bigger than any of us and we were all going to have to cope the best way we knew how .
i also filled our drinking water <UNK> and stuck it in the fridge that was still somewhat cold .
our water stopped as i was filling the <UNK> .
"but at least , we could use that water to flush our toilet ."
next i rushed around gathering up tea lights and candles and placing them where i could find them easily .
<UNK> went downstairs at 5:30 to meet melissa and moments later they both appeared .
melissa was beat red from walking all the way home and then climbing the stairs to our apartment .
it seems that her friend ’s mom refused to give melissa a ride home .
i know that i would not have done that in any circumstance .
i was happy that we were all safe and sound in our little haven .
"what do you do without the internet , music , tv , cooking devices , water , a refrigerator ? within an hour"
all <#> of us were sound asleep hoping with all our might that when we woke up the nightmare would be over .
took the time to laugh and <UNK> like we haven’t in years and as i looked at my grown up baby i was proud .
proud of all that she has become and proud of our relationship .
"it brought a lot of light to my world , by <UNK> things down enough to bring us back to the basics , life , love and family ."
why are we so obsessed with watching other people progress through their day ?
"have we taken "" people watching "" to a new extreme ?"
i was home early from work today and decided to zone out in front of the tv .
"i am not familiar with any of the programs on at that time , so i <UNK> sat <UNK> the remote looking for something interesting to spark my <UNK> ."
"i do n't know about anyone else , but i can hardly stand to watch regular tv anymore ."
where can a person go to escape reality ?
that 's what tv used to do for us .
perhaps more people will return to reading as a <UNK> past time .
"i could not face the <UNK> , instead i did the stay at home mom thing - laundry ."
"when my <#> yr old daughter was in <UNK> , she made a card for me for mother 's day ."
part of the card was about what mom liked to do .... my sweet little girls said - you guessed it - laundry .
"i explained to her that i do n't like doing laundry , but i have to do laundry so we can have clean clothes to wear ."
i do n't think any other mother 's card said that mom liked to do laundry .
i think i need to make the girls start doing their own laundry - they can reach the <UNK> .
i do not like most of it for some reason .
my oldest daughter and husband always suggest pizza hut .
"i know , i have strange thoughts , but i never said i did n't ."
"<#> days with my father , his friend , my sister and her husband , their <#> daughters , my husband and my <#> daughters ."
"i am kidding , i will just go downstairs and <UNK> to get free drinks ."
packing for vacation is a <UNK> and getting ready to leave for vacation is a huge <UNK> .
"we are totally cleaning the house , because we do n't want to come back to a dirty house ."
"packing , i am never sure what to bring and what not to bring - so i always over pack ."
it seems everytime my husband and i have to go somewhere we always get into an argument .
"so i remind him , stay calm because we always argue before a trip ."
"he does n't , i react and we are off to a great start ."
soap <UNK> why do i watch them when i know they <UNK> me ?
i started watching the bold and the beautiful years ago and quit watching it .
"recently i started again , because my oldest daughter started watching it during her summer break ."
it totally pisses me off - i yell at the tv !
what is wrong with these people and why does n't that <#> yr old who is dating
i mean really close her mouth and lips together .
are her <UNK> <UNK> too big for her to close her mouth ?
she reminds me of a <UNK> - you know how they look <UNK> teeth and bones .
"the dating issue - although they are not "" doing <UNK> what the heck does a divorced older guy have in common with a high school student ?"
"can i just say , for anyone who watches this show - who died and made ridge the god of the show ?"
"<UNK> , arrogant , a- hole is what he is ...."
i think i need blood pressure meds everytime i watch that show .
it sucked me in and wo n't let me go .
"as i sit here waiting for my husband to come home from an <#> hour <UNK> , i am <UNK> by my reasons to start a blog ."
who cares what a <#> year old <UNK> with <#> daughters has to say ?
why do i want to give the world access to my thoughts ?
what is within in me that makes me want to put my thoughts out there for everyone ?
"hopefully , the longer i post i will learn the answers and i am certain that some will not be very pretty ."
"my plans for tomorrow - i have to go to the <UNK> to <UNK> my driver 's license - ugh - long lines , impatient people and <UNK> ."
"friday , a mini - vacation with our extended family ."
only <#> word can describe this - scary .
"like , i could take all the tongue <UNK> out of the jar , drop them on the floor and put them back ."
"i would not do that , but it would be funny to see in a comedy skit ."
"ah , what a <UNK> web we <UNK> ."
to say i m involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be <UNK> it .
"but , in a sense , maybe that s what it is ."
"in order to sort this out , i should start from the beginning ."
i was working in a <UNK> for brain injured adults when i met her .
she was a <UNK> <UNK> girl recently arrived in the area from california .
"some how or another , she showed interest in me and <UNK> inviting me places outside of work ."
"but , while i m not all that great at subtle hints , she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me ."
"and so , after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and * <UNK> * <UNK> her , our relationship began ."
"at some point , <UNK> as we were there was an abortion ."
"i do nt want to go into here how bad that affected me ; for her , i can only imagine it was much worse experience ;"
"but , it was her request and i supported it ."
i do know having to walk through a <UNK> of anti - abortion assholes did nt make it easy at all .
not to mention i wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em .
"then , <#> day , she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after i graduated in a semester ."
"afterwards , i continued to go to school and doubt settled in ."
"i move to california , relationship ends , we become friends ... and then the web grows more complicated ...."
"couple of fun things going on , which i 'll probably mention in some later posts ."
this is always is always an epic adventure .
"another , new girl in my circle of friends ."
and when you gain a friend sometimes its good to loose a friend .
sometimes i feel like ' <UNK> ' from the movie of the same name .
i need to talk to people who have the same interests that i have .
who can spark my creativity and make me feel like being social again .
"they ask your advice , you give it , listen to them and they come back next week and complain about the same things ."
some are n't willing to do the work and i am no longer willing to listen .
"ten plus years of that is too much , i need to work on me ."
but i also realize i need to be more social .
so i took a risk am seeking out an old friend .
she could always inspire me and i care for her deeply .
"my best friend has a brain , but he 's not always available ."
it 's not fair to depend upon him entirely .
when i first became <UNK> i felt like i had walked into <UNK> .
like all my <UNK> were just out of reach and i could n't touch them anymore .
"i do n't get real <UNK> like some <UNK> , i get depressed more than anything ."
but i have the right meds and therapy and i 've done some hard fucking work to get where i am now .
"and i 'll continue to face the issues and do the work and improve , like i 'm doing now ."
"but i go through <UNK> , sometimes i can <UNK> through <#> <UNK> <UNK> novels ."
other times i ca n't make it past page <#> .
i have good intentions though and i keep trying .
"like all things , you have to keep it in practice , and i have n't ."
conversation keeps my mind sharp and i need a good <#> .
i 've been thinking about relationships and could i actually do the do .
i could n't even hold his hand in the street .
"when i 'm in that <UNK> off state , i get nervous and terribly self conscious and unsure of myself ."
"i make all kinds of mistakes , i 'm a wreck ."
but that 's when i 'm with ' the wrong guy ' .
the <#> that does n't allow me to be myself .
sure i 'm willing to change things and give and take .
"but , if i 'm not allowed to be who i am as a person , forget it ."
"supposedly , ' who i am ' is part of what attracted you to me in the first place , not ' who i could become ' ."
i do n't like to be <UNK> for my actions or to put myself in the position where i 'm set up for verbal abuse .
"it made me feel like i did when i was growing up , which is why i probably let it go on for as long as i did ."
in many ways he reminded me of my father .
"i was weak , still mourning my uncle , in need of some attention ."
"so much of me knew better , but i was weak at the time ."
"i <UNK> up , got stronger and got rid of him ."
he 's <#> of those <UNK> you just ca n't get rid of in your life .
but distance and will keep him out of mine .
"just concern , i expect to hear he 's dead <#> of these days ."
he taught me that ' even flowers have their <UNK> and nice is different than good . '
"that 's from into the woods , <#> of my favorite plays ."
so i keep my life simple by keeping to myself .
then i remember the consequences and hope that <#> day i wo nt feel this way .
"but i doubt it , i 'd rather be safe than sorry ."
"too much bullshit involved in keeping up a relationship , even a healthy <#> ."
i 've been dealing with loss for quite some time .
"the loss of my sister , my uncle , my dog ."
"i do n't think i 've fully recovered from my uncles death , the most recent <#> ."
"i ca n't talk about my sister , so i guess that 's still kinda ripe ."
"my dog , murphy brown , only fond memories ."
"guess i 've moved pass that and onto loving <UNK> now , although it was hard ."
"we were n't the closest of <UNK> , but we had fun and could talk if necessary ."
i think what i miss most is having a sister .
it 's a wonderful feeling which i highly <UNK> .
"having someone there to share in the family experiences who is also a girl , way cool ."
"like i said , we were n't the best of friends ."
our relationship was getting better as we got older and over the <UNK> <UNK> shit .
"her attitude towards me had changed and she saw me for who i really was , not some brat ."
"things were getting nicer , and then she got <UNK> and <UNK> and then she died ."
i never realized how much he meant to me .
"i think it was because when we use to go out driving , i use to pretend that he was my father ."
"rather than my real father , who caused me nothing but mental anguish ."
"sure , i understand the who , what , where , when and how 's of my father 's <UNK> ."
but they do n't excuse his treatment of me . especially when my mother was there to show him a better way .
he went behind her back to <UNK> and mentally torture us .
"my mother says i 'm alot like my uncle , the brains and sense of humor ."
i wish i had a chance to know him better .
"but as i got older , he became more of a <UNK> and ill ."
he died in the hospital and i cried harder for him than i did for my father .
"things were good for me before his death , i was doing pretty well . getting out more and exercising daily ."
i have n't been able to get back to that place of <UNK> yet .
and now i 'm dealing with the loss that shall not be named .
i had a very good conversation with my friend tonight .
he 's able to put his past behind him and not think in the terms of loss and just keep living .
and the only way to get there is to deal with the main loss that i refuse to face and discuss .
"but , i really ca n't do it because my therapist is on vacation ."
"seriously , i do n't know where these thoughts are gonna take me ."
"either i 'll want to eat the whole world , or <UNK> into a deep depression ."
"i could put it all here , but that would turn into a whining fest ."
life is so ' <UNK> ' when paranoia passes .
"friends are <UNK> , <UNK> is more like family ."
i dare not tell him where my mind went .
"besides , these thoughts are fleeting and i should n't pay them any attention ."
"should have done more constructive things than entertain them , duh ."
"anyways , i wrote my first fan letter ever ."
"probably nothing , but it 's nice to get your thoughts out in the air , even if nobody is listening ."
had this dream that a guy had blown up the safe to all the toys in the world .
"the guy said , "" what 's the use in having all the worlds toys if you ca n't even play with them ."
""" he 's too busy <UNK> them to enjoy their purpose ."
from the war <#> with arms and legs being blown off .
i 'm not sure why today should be different from any other day .
"there is nothing that is there to make things different , but even if there were ."
i 'm not sure if i could handle any type of excitement .
not sure what i can do to change things .
but i need to do something and soon .
i pass my time with writing and my dog .
"you get enough of my <UNK> here , so here 's my dog ."
where you could be yourself without shame or fear of judgement .
"not <#> people as <#> , but <#> people who <UNK> each other , <#> individuals together ."
to me a relationship should be sharing and caring .
"in some ways , relationships scare the shit out of me ."
"but with the right person , it would be as natural as breathing ."
"i know this , i can feel it ."
i 'm a romantic deep down . but life has made me extra <UNK> of so many things .
<UNK> the possibility of ever <UNK> happiness with another person .
i like my solitude at times and at other times the <UNK> kills .
but you are never truly alone in this world .
"i use to say things just to shock strangers , that 's what they get for listening to my conversations ."
"i know you 'll understand . there 's a time device inside of me , i 'm a self <UNK> man . """
"i 've been <UNK> my friend , his phone does n't work ."
i call the cell and he says ' i 'll call you back ' .
"which means forget it , i 'm not calling you back in la language ."
like there 's some plot to keep me from talking to my best friend .
"but i do n't take my friends there , just my mind ."
i do n't entertain these thoughts for more than the instant they are there .
"i <UNK> them , say goodbye and go on my merry way ."
i only get paranoid about not being able to reach my best friend .
i guess it 's a sign of <UNK> where that is concerned .
he 's a male and the first and the only positive male relationship i have ever had in my life .
so it 's important to me . probably more important than anyone will ever realize .
"i love the guy , he 's my teacher , my <UNK> , my brother , my friend ."
i just wish we could spend more time together .
"take what you can get , when you can get it ."
i have maybe a few <UNK> but only <#> real friends .
"<#> has to remember that , especially when it comes to secrets and good deeds and trust ."
i said i believe <UNK> kerry lied under <UNK> .
i meant to say i believe he did not lie under <UNK> .
that does not excuse his actions then or later .

this urllink link when i draw up course websites this fall .
"the intro to lit class , especially , since they 'll be the ones dealing with all things matrix ."
"need to remember to get my hands on some books : <UNK> <UNK> instead of amazon , i think ."
"though if they turn out to be red - pill popping good , i 'll buy , i 'll buy ."
( is there any way out of the blue ? )
i like that he asked the brothers what to read while <UNK> for the matrix trilogy and that he <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> .
lost this morning 's entry . clicked on preview and lost the whole damned thing .
"well , i 've discovered that i 'm feeling reluctant to do journal work in the old way ."
do n't feel like sitting at the table or on the porch or on the couch or on the big chair by the window in the study .
and i ca n't do it at the desk .
all the little <UNK> of my life have been perfectly <UNK> since i moved here last year .
"running was <#> of them , but journal writing is another ."
"i’m not really so <UNK> , you know ."
i started a blog yesterday thinking that i tend to do most of my writing on computer anyway .
now i’m considering the possibility of asking my fiction students in the fall to start blogging .
"they seem to have a hard time committing to it , even when i promise not to read anything private ."
i do often use a little course website ( nothing <UNK> not really computer
"sometimes it gets <UNK> , and some students are more <UNK> than others , but they seem to like checking in ."
you ask me about teaching and receive a lot of <UNK> <UNK> .
but maybe you have thoughts on this stuff ?
"but it ’s just not like that , is it ?"
"i know , i know it <UNK> will make things hard on myself to avoid boredom ."
"some of the finest teachers i’ve had teach the same courses , give the same lectures , literally , <UNK> been teaching and giving for years ."
but i’m beginning to see i’m not that kind of teacher .
"i’m just a bit too <UNK> to teach stuff that isn’t also challenging me , keeping me on edge ."
"the other , which always comes as a surprise to me , is teaching ."
but who the hell knows what that means ?
i tend to think that only a few themes <UNK> in college learning .
i really do feel as if i can teach <UNK> on the wing and <UNK> i’m excited about it .
and i usually lose my enthusiasm for texts once i’ve taught them .
a visiting professor here in the fall told me that professors are nothing more than performing monkeys .
"pull off a great performance , however you do it , and you’ve taught a great class ."
"but my best performances are always spontaneous , always inspired by the <UNK> direction of a discussion rather than delivered as part of a prepared lecture ."
i prefer to hear what someone else think first too .
"but i was always a passive <UNK> , and listening , over speaking , hurt me as a <UNK> ."
"if i was enthusiastic in those days , i was too scared to admit it in the classroom ."
i listened for grade <UNK> and saved my best thinking and saying for papers .
"listening well is an excellent skill , but most people don’t listen well ."
"my voice , my knowledge , my <UNK> criteria ."
if they depend on me for their future <UNK> their <UNK> i’ve failed .
"maybe what i’m trying to teach before anything else is the courage of independent thinking , despite the risks ."
"i give out far too many a ’s , but at the price of their freedom as well as mine ."
now what kind of <UNK> do think i am ?
"i’ll leave off here , though i haven’t responded to much of your note ."
<UNK> has a poem ( not a very good <#> ) about <UNK> .
"the <UNK> figure largely in <UNK> and <UNK> , so i have <UNK> in mind from the poetry ."
"truth is , i’ve only been abroad once , and for <#> week , in london ."
strange thing considering that my scholarship is entirely <UNK> just as involved with revolutionary france .
"money is the first <UNK> , though i admit to feeling lost as a <UNK> , still ."
"the first journey i made across the country was to smith college , and that , not only alone , but not light ."
"i envy your <UNK> , your <UNK> with travel ."
usually i go back to the <UNK> during breaks .
but i do have this fantasy of spending a week or <#> on a hot white beach in mexico .
"i am certain the cat bit my ass in that time to get a rise from me , but i was fighting with morning ."
discovered today a house on <UNK> by the tracks has huge <UNK> plants <UNK> in the yard .
managed to run most of it and to be out for <UNK> minutes or so .
not bad for a <UNK> who has n't used her legs this way for much of last year .
it helps to have found a trail along the tracks .
"in the beginning , what great way to start a book !"
i packed a few clothes and photo albums and the kids and i left california for a new life .
"mom and dad had moved to arkansas a few months earlier so i knew , at least , i had a place to go ."
"well , as usual i just made the best of it ."
"at this point things seemed pretty good , but do n't forget mom is a <UNK> <UNK> !"
i met this <UNK> <UNK> with no job living with some mutual friends )
"sure he was a little younger than me , ( <#> years younger )"
well i brought him home for a weekend to spend some time with me and the kids .
( imagine that ) it was kinda weird the way he left .
"mom was cooking dinner , i <UNK> her where dad was and"
"she said "" out for a walk "" ( nothing unusual ) ."
after an hour or so it <UNK> to get dark and dad had not <UNK> .
"i was back in the house and ready to call the police , but mom did n't seem as concerned ."
"<UNK> , i went to dads medicine cabinet and it was empty ."
"ther first thing out of my mount was "" dad ran away from home "" ."
"as time passed we noticed that he took blankets , we found a <UNK> for another <UNK> truck and the generator was gone ."
mom filed a missing persons report and filed for <UNK> .
"do to a lot of legal issues , we are getting screwed !"
", when all is said and done mom will be lucky to break even , but as <UNK> she does n't see that ."
so in a <UNK> that is where we are as of today ....
california supreme court <UNK> same - sex marriage <UNK> urllink pacific justice institute .
"regardless of your view on same - sex marriage , the rule of law must be <UNK> to ."
we can not have elected officials <UNK> the law to further their political agenda .
it is difficult to pick up a paper or turn on the television without hearing the arguments on both sides of the debate .
"like the majority of the <UNK> , most christians <UNK> watch the debates without becoming involved ."
"in <#> , the <UNK> assembly <UNK> that the church engage in a study on same - gender unions ."
a task force was established to study the issue and submit a report to the <#> <UNK> assembly .
"once the report is <UNK> , a statement on sexuality will be <UNK> and a final statement presented at the <#> <UNK> assembly ."
"despite all the press and even the <UNK> study , most of us have not <UNK> considered how same sex marriage would affect our lives ."
"regardless of your initial feelings about same sex marriage , the time has now come for you to act ."
"as a member of the body of christ , you are responsible for sharing his love ."
you may have very strong feelings <#> way or the other .
"this is <#> of those family <UNK> that must be addressed , action must be taken , and <UNK> must occur ."
please take the time to <UNK> yourself on this topic and <UNK> consider and respond to the study ; keeping christ 's love at the <UNK> .
i finally finished the first chapter of a story .
"nothin big , something i have been meaning to do for along time ."
"more for my friends then to be published , i read it over <#> times , spell checked it <#> times then mailed it out ."
funny thing is i was not as nervous as i thought i would have been .
"i had a really nice day yesterday , it stated with a call at <#> am , my sister in law was in the hospital in labor ."
by <UNK> pm a wonderful <UNK> baby girl was born .
so of course i rushed to the hospital to see them .
"well let me start at the <UNK> , last december when my husband woke me to get ready for <UNK> shift at the <UNK> home i was working at ."
"he did as he always did , he layed our then <#> <UNK> old baby girl in my arms ."
to my terror i was unable to feel her or use my left side at all .
"we rushed to the <UNK> thinking i had a stroke , thankfully after <UNK> testing that was not what had happened ."
they still do not know why i lost the use of parts of my body .
"due to <UNK> and health and welfare <UNK> me help , i have been unable to see a doctor in several months ."
"so each day i wake up in pain , <UNK> that i will make it just alittle longer ."
"<UNK> the past few months i have been <UNK> memories of my childhood , my short term <UNK> no longer works ."
if i do nt write it down i forget in what feels like <#> minute .
"but threw it all i have found out who is really a friend ,"
"yes i have lost alot of people who said they would always be there , but i am sure we all have ."
"my husband , my best friend has been at my side threw it all , i know it is so hard on him ."
"looking at the woman who was so full of life , now unable to do all the things she loves to do ."
"a dear friend told me of this place , a woman i have come to admire threw the years ."
"she keeps me pushing for the next day , even tho we only talk online , i would like to shake her hand someday ."
"well now i struggle more each day to be as <UNK> as i can , trying not to <UNK> about the small stuff to much ."
i will always keep going as long as i can .
"i was listening to the television , it ’s often on for background <UNK> and good charlotte ’s song came on and it stopped me.."
"alas life is change , it ’s pain , learning , growing , it ’s anything but fair ."
"this is the “ soundtrack ” in my head , i’m stuck with it.. figured i’d share ..."
do you know what you 're doing to me ?

my family and i went to <UNK> together and it was the first time my brother ’s kids had ever gone .
so sharing in there first of hopefully many more visits to the magic kingdom over their lifetime had great meaning to me .
i think my favorite part personally is that we got to see <UNK> and the fireworks show after .
"it ’s unbelievably cool to watch , basically there is a river in the center of <UNK> where tom <UNK> ’s island is and the mark twain <UNK> circles ."
"instead i 'm awake , minutes from my shower , and getting in the car to go be with my family who ’s flying in today ."
i hate when all your body wants to do is collapse but your mind wo n't shut the hell up !
"for me it has produced some interesting creative <UNK> still "" <UNK> my <UNK> "" i would enjoy not <UNK> through my next day ."

well i have an odd sort of tradition in my house i thought i 'd share .
this empty page is <UNK> me my pens run out of ink the words are dancing ‘

up all night.. back again in the early <UNK> never before has a game so completely captured my attention as urllink <UNK> has .
from the day the beta cd came in the mail to present day i have been totally <UNK> .
"i have always loved rpg ’s , i 've even been looking to dust off the old dice , but this <#> takes the cake ."
"i’ve met so many great people , and i love my guild “ a fire inside ” ."
i used to go through games pretty <UNK> buy them for $ <#> and a week maybe <#> later be on the hunt for another .
"the angels , not half so happy in heaven , went <UNK> her and me yes !"
"n a t u r e ' s f i r s t g r e e n i s g o l d ,"

could you ask for a more embarassing set of quotes ?
"the white house calls the quotes "" ridiculous <UNK> "" ."
<#> : ( in law ) evidence based on the reports of others rather than the personal knowledge of a witness and therefore generally not <UNK> as testimony .
something that many overweight people do is neglect their health .
i had not gone to a personal doctor since i had given birth to my son who is now <#> years old .
several months ago i made the decision to start taking care of myself in other ways besides low <UNK> .
i started exercising and i made an appointment with a new doctor to build a long - term relationship .
"i made the dreaded appointment and went in for the full meal deal , physical , blood , <UNK> and even a <UNK> ."
the doctor was fantastic and so easy to talk to .
"she didn’t judge , was <UNK> and most of all thrilled when i told her that i had lost <UNK> over the past year . once"
"all the test results came back , i found out that everything looked great ."
"my blood pressure was still a reliable <#> , my <UNK> were <#> , <UNK> <UNK> <#> and <UNK> <#> , and even my <UNK> was a- ok ."
it seemed the only thing that was a bit off were my <UNK> levels and that would explain why i would lose so much hair each time i showered .
"i started taking a <UNK> <UNK> and within a month , my hair stopped coming out in <UNK> ."
all was well and i pronounced fit until next year ’s visit .
it was the body ’s own <UNK> sending an electrical signal to <UNK> the heart and most people didn’t even feel <UNK> <UNK> did not stop .
it started on monday morning and when it didn’t go away by the next morning and i started to feel faint
", i called my doctor who fit me in right away ."
the nurse said my <UNK> was <UNK> and my blood pressure had gone up to <#> .
they wanted to do a blood test and check my <UNK> since a <UNK> problem could cause this and they wanted to perform an <UNK> .
fortunately i got a great <UNK> who found a vein immediately and it wasn’t even uncomfortable .
"the <UNK> was next and she took me to a room , handed me a gown and left ."
"i looked at the gown and judging from its “ <UNK> stamp ” size , i knew that this wasn’t going to fit me ."
"at this point i had gotten very scared so when she came in and sat down , i was studying her every facial expression and movement ."
"you know , the look that someone gets when they are about to give you some unpleasant news !"
most definitely not a look you want to get from your doctor .
she informed me that i have “ <UNK> <UNK> ” and proceeded to draw me a <UNK> about how the heart works and what is going on .
"basically <UNK> <UNK> is a fancy way of saying that the heart ’s <#> smaller , upper <UNK> <UNK> instead of beating effectively ."
"blood isn’t pumped completely out of them , so it may pool and <UNK> ."
"if a blood <UNK> leaves the heart and becomes <UNK> in an <UNK> in the brain , a stroke results ."
all i could do was look at her in disbelief .
inside i just wanted to scream but i just said “ so what is the treatment ?
then i would have to start a blood <UNK> ( <UNK> ) so as to prevent a <UNK> from forming .
i left the doctors office and barely made it out to my car before completely breaking down .
how could i come so far in changing my bad habits only to have such a thing happen ?
"once i sucked it up , i made it to the <UNK> to pick up my new <UNK> ."
"i know the <UNK> well and he was <UNK> as usual ; when he saw what had been filled and that it was for me , he gave me the"
“ look ” and i was again reminded that this is serious .
a half hour after taking the beta <UNK> drug ( <UNK> ) the <UNK> stopped and i was so relieved .
i even slept very well that night and <UNK> in the morning .
"after breakfast that first day , i <UNK> my website for a bit and headed out to get my blood drawn ."
"again , i was getting upset but <UNK> off to another clinic for the <UNK> ."
"i got there , asked for <UNK> and was directed down the hall ."
"this time i was given a decent gown and the <UNK> was very informative , telling me what everything was and what he was going to do next ."
the procedure is just like an <UNK> and i got to see my <UNK> opening and closing as well as the heart pumping .
soon my fear was replaced by interest as he explained it all .
"i was doing some research recently and found a very good <UNK> website that talks about a newly recognized condition known as "" <UNK> eating disorder "" ."
"<#> ) eating large amounts of food , even when not physically hungry ."
<#> ) eating alone out of embarrassment at the <UNK> of food being eaten .
"<#> ) feelings of disgust , depression , or guilt after <UNK> ."
"i know that prior to low <UNK> , i could have have answered "" yes "" to each of those items on the list . now ?"
i 'm not <UNK> after <#> months because i 'm a stronger person or more <UNK> !
i do n't have a stronger will power than others here !
i believe that they are just beginning to scratch the surface on this and it will be low <UNK> who help pick this all apart .
we have a unique opportunity to get this information out there and give hope to others who just ca n't see a solution .
i know that many people who read this still struggle with the <UNK> but know that you are not alone and that you have the tools to combat this .
you are much closer to your transformation than you think and keep getting back on the wagon .
you are not a failure and can do this .
i just read an article about a woman who had reached <UNK> and her skin had <UNK> to the couch where she lay for <#> years .
these stories are written to <UNK> the <UNK> of the situation but i wonder how many people think of what hell it must be for the person involved ?
making sport of or <UNK> against the overweight seems to be the last socially acceptable form of <UNK> .
of course there are some people who make it a lifestyle choice but i do n't think the vast majority of those struggling with their weight are just lazy .
i guess i do n't have a magic answer but i do know that i 'm going to do whatever i can to help anyone who asks me .
how many of you go out and about and see someone who needs to low carb ?
do you want to go up to them and try to get them to give it a try ?
i 've thought about it but never do because it would be rude and who knows ?
maybe they already are low <UNK> or thinking about it .
we are in a position of helping by being an example to others ...
maybe they 'll see our success and take some hope for themselves .
for as far back as i can remember i 've had <#> sort of food issue or another and have been overweight .
"because of the treatment by my peers i started to skip school in the 7th grade and by the 9th grade , i had dropped out altogether ."
"the pain of going to class , feeling everyone 's eyes on me and receiving cruel comments was far too much for me to bear ."
i eventually went for my <UNK> and then off to college
but i always remember that there was no prom or graduation ceremony for me .
no class <UNK> where i could catch up on the <UNK> old days .
my weight and the subsequent treatment from my peers took that all away from me .
"the ironic thing is that when i look back , i really <UNK> all that big at all yet the impact was life <UNK> ."
when i was in college i met my future husband .
"all through my marriage , my weight has been an issue ."
"i 've been on so many <UNK> , i ca n't even count them all but usually had minor , if any , success ."
i do n't want to paint him as a bad guy because he is not .
"yes , maybe he would have liked to have an average - sized wife to show off but how could i blame him ."
would i be so thrilled to have an <UNK> husband ?
"i 've thought about it a lot and i honestly ca n't answer the question , i just do n't know ."
i would never be able to go to the movies or sports events .
"i would n't be able to go <UNK> riding or <UNK> , or to a hot climate for vacation because i would be so uncomfortable ."
maybe i would n't even be able to sit in the stadium for my own daughter 's graduation in <#> !
i <UNK> like going to restaurants because there were too many <UNK> .
were they going to put me in a booth that was too small ?
", i would have to accept that my life would be severely limited ."
in april <#> i heard on the news that dr .
atkins had passed away from a head injury that he had <UNK> earlier in the month from a fall .
"after that , there seemed to be a lot of discussion everywhere about his diet and lifestyle and i started looking into it ."
i went to the atkins center website and read as much as i could about it .
i remembered that i had heard several years ago about how unhealthy it was and that you could have a heart attack
so i was very surprised to read the science behind it an how much it made sense to me and i had hope for the first time in years .
i bought the atkins book and started <UNK> on the 24th of april .
"sometime around that , there was an <UNK> showing of dr ."
atkins ' january interview with larry king and i was amazed at what a wonderful man dr .
atkins was and sad that he had been <UNK> by the medical establishment for so long .
"fortunately before he passed away , there were several studies that came out <UNK> admitting that his plan worked ."
"i drove <#> miles each way , every <#> weeks to weigh myself on their scale ."
", how had i let myself get to be <#> pounds ?"
what would people say if they knew how much i really weighed ?
"my husband became the "" food police "" and would continually comment how much i ate , what i ate , and why something was "" missing "" ."
"i only went further underground into <UNK> , <UNK> eating ."
"<UNK> was interesting and <UNK> amazing , to say the least ."
"suddenly i was n't hungry , i had to literally force myself to eat at regular <UNK> ."
i had spent so many years trying to keep my eating under control without success and now i felt like food was in a proper perspective .
i enjoyed eating but it was n't an all - consuming thing and i had time and energy to think about other things .
there was so much more to life than food .
since starting atkins i have lost <#> pounds and still have another <#> pounds to go
so i am by no means a before and after case but i m on my way !
nothing in this world is going to stop me .
i immediately began to crave more food ; i became frustrated and angry and did n't know why .
"all of the sudden it occurred to me that there must be hidden carbs and upon <UNK> my <UNK> , i found out that it was indeed true ."
there was a definite and extreme effect when i introduced even the smallest amount of <UNK> carb food .
i used to hate myself ; i thought that i was weak .
i thought that i had no <UNK> and that i was worthless because of it .
i forgive myself for getting this heavy and now i have the knowledge and means of <UNK> it .
"after <#> years , i finally have a chance at a full life ."
at this time i 'm building a business as a low carb lifestyle coach so i can help others by doing something that i feel <UNK> about .
"i set my alarm to go off at <UNK> , and i 'm usually hitting the <UNK> until around <UNK> ."
those <UNK> <UNK> drop me from <#> <UNK> experience to the next .
"although i have done some reading on <UNK> dreams , i do n't specifically try do anything to bring them on ."
the same goes for the out - of - body experiences that i have had .
"they are not as common for me as the <UNK> dreams , but they still occasionally happen ."
i had many of them as a child .
finding myself out in the yard in the middle of the night or <UNK> down the fire escape <#> steps at a time .
"what 's so strange , is that i have been able to retain such vivid memories of both types of experiences for years and years ."
"<UNK> "" kind of thing , nor is it a romantic <UNK> ."
it 's a deeper feeling of knowing the other person involved .
like we 're both <UNK> into the same virtual reality machine at the same time .
i do n't know how else to describe it .
there must be other people that have similar experiences .

did anyone see that photo of john kerry on the flight deck of the space shuttle in that little bunny costume ?
"where were the ears , the pink nose and <UNK> ?"
. only in white ( of course ) .
"even funnier is the fact that after it hit the press , his camp got all <UNK> and embarrassed ."
"maybe that 's true , but it does n't take anyone else to make him look like the boob he is ."
who does kerry 's camp think they 're kidding ?
they arranged this photo - op and it <UNK> on them .
i know this is trivial but so is he and i 'm having fun with it .
i 'm building a <UNK> patio in the back yard .
it 's been <#> of those kind of projects .
"you 're not supposed to start these kinds of projects in the middle of the arizona summer . """
now why did you give me this woman for a wife lord ?
"to get me into these kind of <UNK> ? """
the <UNK> itself has been interesting to work with .
the various pieces are n't consistent in <UNK> .
"most are heavy , yet far too fragile ."
the boys and i have worked like <UNK> .
first <UNK> <UNK> pounds of rock from the front yard delivery spot into the back yard .
"there were <#> "" washing operations "" to see what i have to work with ."
"the worst has been working a "" <UNK> puzzle , "" with <UNK> pound pieces , to figure out how best to place the individual <UNK> ."
<#> of my sons suddenly understands what a lack of education will do to him .
he 's taking school a little more seriously now ( i think ) .
the boys and i have been working together in relative harmony .
"the work has put muscle back on me , and re - <UNK> soft hands ."
"( i really needed the exercise , anyway . )"
my local church hopes to be building before fall .
i suspect i 'll be using my freshly <UNK> <UNK> skills on the new church house .
i see god 's timing in all of this .
i have tried to avoid breaking up the stone .
"eventually , i will have to break the bigger pieces into smaller pieces ."
"already , i have "" <UNK> some of the <UNK> so they 'll fit in where i want them ."
"as a member of god 's church , you 're a lot like those <UNK> of stone ."
you 're going to need <UNK> to fit in where he wants you .
"he may break you up into smaller pieces , so you 'll fit the pattern he is <UNK> ."
"when the work is done , you 'll be a treasure and valuable addition to house ."
"the <UNK> and <UNK> , in the makers hands , are your friends ."
"today i went to that <UNK> of character and morality , the american red cross , and allowed them to <UNK> my life ."
i must say i passed the examination and was allowed to contribute to this society and culture .
so all i did was donate a pint of blood .
"if you have n't <UNK> blood lately , there 's a not - so - trivial , <UNK> <UNK> to go through ."
they ask you who you 've had sex with .
they ask you about the conditions under which you 've had sex with people .
they are quick to <UNK> against drug <UNK> and homosexuals .
they are n't too keen on extended international travel either .
( i did n't realize that where you travel <UNK> to your character . )
they 're somewhat <UNK> about family history also .
"if you lack character , eventually you 'll drive into an error ."
"the error will be what people remember , not your great accomplishments ."
the legacy of dick nixon is all about <UNK> instead of china or the economy .
"bill clinton 's presidency will always be <UNK> by "" that woman "" instead of the economy and balanced budget ."
i go down to donate for the <UNK> as much as the sick kids .
"it matters who you are and what you do , even when you think no <#> 's looking ."
i went to the board office and filled out the paperwork and etc . because it put us in a new home school zone .
well out of my <#> kids only <#> were scheduled at the right school !
i got everything all settled now but what a hassle this last week has been
like if you do n't buy what they want the school will buy it for them !
"so lets drive safely , and watch out for the kids in our neighborhood !"
so after using blockbuster online for a week i have seen no real difference between it and <UNK> .
just yesterday i found out that blockbuster started an online dvd club like <UNK> .
also blockbuster does not have as big of a collection as <UNK> but it is still rather extensive !
"hello everyone , this is my blog , the newest thing so i am told !"
"share pictures , news , cool stuff i hear !"
i am a movie <UNK> so you can expect to see entertainment news .
i am a mom of <#> so recipes or tips on cutting corners is always good !
"what a weekend ! if any of you have never been to <UNK> island , the long weekend in august every year is a great time to visit !"
"this year , we decided to be a part of the <UNK> and become <UNK> ."
this is an outdoor event by the way .
the first day we set up outside of the <UNK> centre in little current on a small grass <UNK> between the drive and the parking lot .
( it was about <#> am for <UNK> turned out to be a great location becuase we really needed the tree that we set up under .
"the day was <UNK> , threatening to break out in a heck of a storm ."
across from us was a clothing <UNK> and his family who were a great help when my tent refused to go up on its own .
( its really wonderful to meet such great folks ! )
i had a great lady set up beside me ( <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> here in <UNK> ) and the <#> of us rode the bad weather together .
luckily she brought <UNK> which were much needed when the storm finally broke through the gray sky and we got dumped on .
the weather finally drove us to close up shop as it was tearing down larger <UNK> beside us and causing a heck of a mess .
the next morning i set up quite early on the main street downtown in little current .
i had a fabulous view right onto the <UNK> of the <UNK> looking at the north channel .
at <#> am the temperature had already hit <#> degrees c. hot !
i brought extra stones with me for the base of my tent just in case !
"the main street was blocked off , so we had to <UNK> our vehicles and move them ."
the heat continued to build and so did the energy of the day !
i 'd like to thank everyone who attended the festival and came to my booth for making this show a fabulous success for us !
the streets were <UNK> with people and i was lucky to be beside a great food <UNK> that made the most fabulous home made <UNK> and fried <UNK> !
yum ! by <#> pm i was feeling pretty tired ....
my family was meeting in little current for a dinner and they were sweet to bring me a plate to <UNK> on - thanks ! !
"a big <UNK> to my cousin <UNK> , who hosted the dinner"
( i did not get to thank her properly as i was <UNK> busy when she showed up )
the night continued on and finally around <#> pm we had to close up shop as the fireworks were about to start .
"you know , sometimes being a <UNK> in canada is not easy ."
i 've been looking for a good e - commerce solution so that i can sell in both <UNK> ( us and ca )
( all the contact info is on our webpage )
"anyways , i 'm off to make some more <UNK> right now the stock is low on the site since we had a fabulous time at <UNK> weekend ."
maybe i 'll post about that later on .
<UNK> and welcome to our blog what 's a blog ?
"it 's a personal inside look into our business and maybe some of the "" little "" things that go on in our lives from day to day ."
"call it a peek inside of the shell you see here on the internet , a place where you can become a part of our day ."
well i hope you enjoy our view behind the magic curtain .
last night i <UNK> with brian and randy .
"( this is jeff 's band , minus jeff , who got married saturday and is busy . )"
brian invited a <UNK> he 'd never heard to come jam with us .
"jd , though a very sweet young woman , is a <UNK> musician ."
she did n't get her guitar in tune .
i suffer when i must endure an out - of - tune guitar .
"afterward , i learned that randy felt the same ."
"she is an ok <UNK> , though the <UNK> problems made that difficult to <UNK> for certain ."
she finally left at 10:00 pm and we had <#> jam ... what a waste of an evening .
... i get so little time to jam .
it would be so <UNK> to be rude .
that 's not the kind of person i am .
i guess this is just turning into a diary ... that 's not my intent .
"randy , brian , and i discussed the issue of what and why we are being a band ."
"dana "" quit "" joe 's band yesterday ."
i guess we 'll <UNK> along for awhile to see if things change for him .
"if they do n't , then we 'll need to look into getting a new <UNK> ."
background : i play in <#> bands ... <#> is joe 's band .
it is a good band and joe is a great song writer .
it is a jam band working to find an identity .
"i have only <UNK> with them once before tonight , my second jam ."
the experience for me is <#> of meditation while playing my instrument .
it first happened <UNK> when i was <#> years old .
i was performing with my band and suddenly my hands were playing guitar without me !
my thoughts stopped and i just watched as my hands played the best performance of my life .
"perhaps this is what athlete 's call being "" in the zone . """
i have since become obsessed with <UNK> that type of experience .
"my focus over the years has been primarily on <UNK> , though i think now that i was mistaken about the importance of its role ."
"i 'm trying to make an artistic expression , through music , in a <UNK> culture and , obviously , they are not a good fit ."
i 've been playing electric guitar for <#> years now but have n't <UNK> successfully as an artist .
"there are probably a lot of reasons for that , and maybe this blog will aid in my progress ."
music is as much about growth as a person as about making a sound .
well ... i have needed a lot of sleep ! ! !
"all right ... it would be nice to have more direct interaction , but i guess you do n't want to do that right now ..."
the way i feel is that i want to talk to y o u ...
i want to feel y o u ... it 's the way i feel ...
i want less things <UNK> us ... is that sooooo bad ?
of course woke up later than usual ... and got into making this picture for site ... but should have written first .... ! ! ! !
... that will still give me time to work on pictures and now ...
! and focus more on gym ... which is really my main big push right now ....
otherwise i get <UNK> involved in creative internet activities and frankly ... lose track of time ...
when she married jack ... he adopted us and we became <UNK> . )
good morning sunshine and <UNK> and cream ! today
.... i am working on more <UNK> ... and pictures ...
i do n't know why i need sooo much sleep lately ...
maybe it 's because i need it ! ! !
catch <#> .... what do you think about it ! ? !
then i see unhappy <#> when i 'm not on computer .
we have been on computer for a long time now .
i 've got stuff for you to sign ... ! ! ! ! !
what do you think of this new blog thingy ... .... at least it has dates and times on it .... if you prefer to not use this
"<#> ... let me know by saying : "" i love spaghetti ! """
... i had a bunch of things ready to put up ...
then some power <UNK> .... miss you .... ~
"but when dear , and how do i make plans for that ... reality ... <UNK> exclusive ..."
i found an online interactive calendar so i 'm working on putting that up ... woo hoo ! ! ! !
i 'm not happy till i get that in order ... !
thank you for that t - shirt ... from last night !
"! <UNK> me <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ! ! ? ?"
we need a plan ... or i need a plan !
"plan a , b or c ! ( working on plan options )"
that 's ok.. and the way it should be ...
w : are we in a committed relationship ?
"w : you know i 'm <UNK> "" and have short curly hair ."
"k : you 're the <#> , baby ."
"moi <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> et <UNK> ..."
the pitch the first piece of information that an editor should see in your media kit is your “ pitch
this letter needs to immediately grab the editor ’s attention .

media releases or articles include a press release or feature article in your kit .

the press release should also be typed or printed on a letter - quality computer printer in black on your <UNK> <UNK> .
"your background include a brief description of your background , accomplishments and education ."
it should be printed on your <UNK> in the same manner as the “ pitch ” letter and the press release .
"include the name of your contact as a <UNK> or title , in larger type , at the top of the page ."
indicate that this is your background profile or <UNK> profile .
photos your photos or slides can support the press release and create a more compelling story .
use color and black and white photos if possible .

pr <UNK> - also known as public relations <UNK> - <UNK> ongoing activities to ensure the client has a strong public image .
"public relations campaigns are most often conducted through the internet , newspapers , television and magazines ."
"advertising <UNK> promote a product or service , and help to attract the attention of potential and current customers ."
publicity <UNK> help the client gain the attention of the media .
you can find a directory of <UNK> in your area at urllink <UNK> .
it takes research and highly experienced teams to produce a brand concept that <UNK> the consumer 's identity and then gains their acceptance .
i 've watched <UNK> and professionals ( in the entertainment and arts ) conduct marketing and <UNK> through desperation .
marketing can not be without focus and clearly defined objective thinking .
"the "" trick "" is , to capture your unique story and tell it <UNK> ."
"it 's actually no trick , but essential for success ."
<UNK> media is <#> of los angeles ' fastest growing <UNK> and they 've apparently got it right .

thought for the day : to live life to the fullest is grand .
beauty fades ... as does the memory of it .
"in the marketing and <UNK> world , it 's not unusual to find companies trying , sometimes desperately , to bond with the <UNK> consumer ."
have you seen coca - cola 's new <UNK> ads ?
"after several minutes of fun and feel - good , they tell you it all can be yours with a colorful new <UNK> ."
well back in the day it had some real juice . . .
well the point of all this <UNK> is that human response to what we see <UNK> does n't change much over time .
"whether you 're feeling crazy , funky , <UNK> , trendy , hip , or traditional , the image you project causes people around you to make similar <UNK> ."
"clothing , <UNK> , hair color ( facial hair or not ) , and <UNK> all play a role in creating an <UNK> for you ."
"so , i ask you <UNK> , who are you going to be today ?"
"the beautiful thing is , you can be whatever you want ."
"well , i finally started the back of the beast ( my <UNK> ) last night ."
"i was wondering if i could pull it off , but i did ."
i was n't thinking when i started this project and i knit the front first .
<UNK> had a gap of <#> stitches that needed to be filled .
i have only been knitting a couple of years .
"i had someone show me how to cast on , knit and <UNK> then we moved ."
i did n't even know how to cast off .
i had no <#> to teach me and the local yarn shop would n't help because i did n't buy my yarn or pattern from them .
i could n't get it from looking a pictures in books .
i taught myself how to cast off with a <UNK> hook .
( i can <UNK> just enough to make a simple scarf )
"i mentioned "" the art of knitting "" dvd the other day ..."
"well , it shows how to add stitches to a piece in progress ."
"i did what it said and ta da , it worked ."
it has helped me more with problems and things forgotten than all my reference books combine .
( i 'm <#> of those people who need to learn by being shown .
sometimes i just do n't get it by looking at <UNK>
"for inspiration i 'll keep my books , but for technical how to 's i 'll take this dvd <UNK> urllink <UNK> , com <UNK> it out ."
well i 'm back to working on the beast .
i want to get this thing finished ! ! !
since monday is <UNK> ( <UNK> object ) night i will be working on mom 's sweater .
"please do n't tell her about it , it 's for christmas ."
"i need to do the shoulder <UNK> for the back , then it 's on to the front ."
i think i 'm going to ask santa for a nice digital camera for <UNK> .
yesterday i worked on hats and i bought some nice cream <UNK> weight for a sweater .
( this thing is <UNK> 's <#> inches wide and <#> inches long .
it does n't help much that i 'm so fluffy .
i finally finished the neck so now it 's down the back then the trim and it 's done .
<UNK> feels like i have been working on this forever .
"it 's very similar to the free <UNK> pattern in "" family circle easy knitting "" fall <#> issue ."
when i 'm finished it will also have a hood ....
"ok , i guess i 'm not half <UNK> sure felt good to say it though . )"
"<UNK> urllink the boy urllink the girl urllink i just wanted to introduce you to my cast of characters . """
". then we have "" the <UNK> ... my almost <#> year old daughter ."
"he is my soul mate , and my life !"
"( <UNK> <UNK> , hubby , honey , sweetie and when i 'm upset bone head , butt head and or meat head )"
";) all kidding aside , i could n't live <UNK> him . now on to knitting talk ... the square should be in the mail today ."
"i just got my first issue of "" <UNK> 's "" in the mail today ... so watch your mail box for your 's ."
i am not getting enough knitting time in while i 'm trying to set up this blog .
i do n't think it 's going to bad though .
"fluffy urllink good evening all , i just had to let everyone about mr ."
"i was accepted to the "" fluffy <UNK> blog ring "" ."
"it may not be much to some , but to me it 's a big deal ."
the people in this ring are some of the nicest people i have ever come across not to mention some of the most talented .
"( just to let you know how happy i am about this , it took me <#> hours to get mr ."
"i 'm not sure how i got it there , but it is there ."
i told you i 'm new to this whole blog thing . )
":) anyway , he is the <UNK> for our web ring ."
so let me just say thanks to the group for letting me be a part .
i was in need of some inspiration so i checked out what other knitting bloggers are working on .
all of the knitting out there is outstanding ! ! ! !
i know i will never <UNK> the talent of these blogger but it did spark my creativity .
"( another great place for inspiration is the "" <UNK> <UNK> gallery "" . )"
i will finish the square i am working on for a friend then go back to work on the <UNK> i am working on .
i took parts from different patterns that i liked and combined them into the pattern i wanted .
"if it looks ok when it 's done i send a picture to <UNK> ( maybe she 'll put it in the gallery , it could happen ) ."
it 's plain by most <UNK> standards but i knit to relax ( it keeps my blood pressure down ) .
it was not a great day for me today .
"i was informed today that the bike run for the "" rockin - <UNK> hat drive "" would have to be put on hold till next riding season ."
"i was looking forward to it , oh well there 's always next year ."
if i had tried to plan this a little earlier in the motorcycle season i might have been able to pull this off .
"so , until next season , i will continue to make hats ."
i am still collecting hats if anyone would like to donate .
any hats collected after that will be held till the run next year .
i would like to wish carol from ( <UNK> ) a <UNK> recovery .
i hope so much that you will soon be able to return to your family .
i recently discovered books on tape ( or cd ) .
of course i had heard about them some time ago but never thought twice about them .
then not long ago someone said they listen to them while they knit .
"while knitting , doing <UNK> or whenever i can ."
it sure does beat rotting your brain with all that t.v .
the best part is if you miss part of it you can <UNK> and catch what you missed .
"today i bought "" <UNK> of <UNK> "" by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ( on tape ) ."
"a while ago i read her book "" the <UNK> of <UNK> "" i thought it was very good ."
"right now i am listening to , "" <UNK> found "" by <UNK> <UNK> ."
it 's not usually the type of story i 'm interested in but it 's pretty good .
is it just me or are the weekends getting shorter ? ! ? !
it was friday then all of a sudden it 's monday .
"you know , errands and running the kids all over town ."
i was beginning to wonder if i would get a few minutes to write today .
i took a break from the hats last night .
"i have a <UNK> that i had put on hold , ( since all the hat business came along ) that is screaming to be worked on ."
i think i will pay some attention to it today .
mom 's sweater ( a christmas present ) is screaming too .
maybe i will divide my time between the <#> .
i picked up some <UNK> yarn today at the craft store .
i saw a <UNK> pattern for a <UNK> made with it .
i should have details set in a few days .
i have more phone calls to make in the morning .
yesterday i broke out the <UNK> to work on hats .
i am hoping to put some serious time in today and make some more .
i hand knit them in the evening and machine knit them during the day .
"last night my brother bob , dropped off his <#> and - a - half year old son ."
it was a nice distraction having a little <#> around .
he even helped me make a hat for himself .
he just woke up and asked to go back upstairs to make himself another hat .
i just do n't get to see them enough .
"well ... i'm off to feed the little guy , read a couple stories and make him another hat !"
i sure do miss having a little <#> around ! ! !
i have n't done much today but work on this blog .
i 'm trying to get as much info up as i can .
when i am finished here i will go work on some more hats .
"( i have only had a few <UNK> , i hope things pick up . )"
i will try to get around to <UNK> it later on today .
i think i will move on to some a little simpler in style and color .
i think i 'll use the good old <UNK> left <UNK> from my <UNK> .
"i have a nice <UNK> <UNK> , purple , green , and white and pair it with a solid <UNK> ."
"as soon as i figure out how , i will add some pictures of my hats ."
i have never worked on a blog or website or anything else like this before .
"who says you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks , huh ?"
i do n't think i 'm doing to bad for setting this up last night .
;) thank you for helping me set this up last night honey .
i am collecting hats to be <UNK> to university hospitals of cleveland and the veterans hospitals at wade park and <UNK> all in ohio .
"they will be given to <UNK> who either from <UNK> therapy , an illness or due to medication are experiencing hair loss ."
i will accept any kind of hat or head covering .
"many of the people receiving the head gear are very ill , so all must be new with tags on if purchased from a store ( hospital rules ) ."
"store bought hats , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , do - <UNK> or anything can be used to cover a head would be greatly appreciated ."
"it does n't matter if it 's for men , women , teens or children , all are needed ."
i told a few people last week i was collecting hats and the whole thing <UNK> .
the way things sit right now it looks like it 's getting big .
a couple of motorcycle groups are interested in participating .
a local <UNK> has offered their establishment as a <UNK> area and a <UNK> after distribution .
a couple of radio stations may also get involved .
i am also seeking <UNK> for <UNK> to be <UNK> off .
"a few weeks ago i purchased a dvd titled "" the art of knitting "" ."
it 's a great tool for experienced and <UNK> <UNK> alike .
( <UNK> just in case you are interested ) any way
", i got another <#> in the mail today ."
i called the company and told them i received a second by mistake .
i explained to them about the hat drive and they said i could use it as a <UNK> prize .
they also told me that the hat pattern that comes with the dvd may be used as a pattern for the hat drive .
i will be collecting hats through november 12th <#> .
hats to be <UNK> on the motorcycle run need to be received by september 17th <#> .
final distribution for hats collected after the run is set for november <#> .
i will be posting a mailing address in a few days so stay tuned .
"since the release of "" the <UNK> code "" by dan brown , much controversy has <UNK> over the <UNK> of its claims ."
"the book is <UNK> in that it has exposed ideas which , although hardly new , have not been considered by the public as a whole ."
<UNK> seem eager to explore the possibility that there may be more to the story than they have been exposed to .
"<UNK> , we see a return to <UNK> christian views in many areas of the western world ."
"the stage is being set , it seems , for a a clash of ideas ."
"both are from a long line of tradition , although <#> current of thought has had to keep a relatively low profile until recently ."
i was <UNK> by <UNK> who assured me that i would roast in the fires of hell for following this false prophet .
"when i experience these moments , i 've developed the habit of stopping to ask myself what it is that i am <UNK> to ."
i found myself looking in the mirror at this young <UNK> about my own age ; willing to argue my case to the last .
"i <UNK> that even though our views are <UNK> opposed , i was able to bring enough tolerance and respect to the encounter to <UNK> any <UNK> ."
"a small thing , maybe . in my younger days the outcome would have been very different ."
i do n't know if there is a name for the path i 'm on .
"christianity may not appeal to me in most of it 's <UNK> , but i can not say that it is <UNK> of merit ."
"for some , it 's a very beneficial part of their lives , providing comfort and <UNK> in uncertain times ."
"if i 'd felt like it , i could have left this poor guy <UNK> his faith , identity , and the perception of the reality he lives in ."
i personally feel called and compelled to search for the infinite in the manner i do .
i 'm certain this young man felt the same about his chosen path .
i was guilty of enjoying the <UNK> that spread across my face when i saw the sign of <#> of the <UNK> .
""" the bible was written in plain english . """
i figure that sums up their position better than i ever could .
i 've become increasingly frustrated with the current state of affairs in spiritual matters .
it seems getting in touch with god is once again in <UNK> .
"britney , madonna , <UNK> have all <UNK> in on my territory giving all of us <UNK> a bad name ."
it appeals to masses brought up in a fast - food environment .
i am anxious for everyone to forget this fad .
"then , perhaps , i 'll be able to delete the <UNK> i find it necessary to add when asked of my interest in the subject ."
""" yes , but not the madonna version "" ."
my thoughts today centered on our seemingly endless <UNK> on giving god human characteristics .
the word god is a generic title which simply means <UNK> .
the <UNK> <#> <UNK> name of god given to us from the old testament has been <UNK> over the years .
it is often referred to as the <UNK> .
"<UNK> of <#> hebrew characters ; <UNK> - heh - <UNK> - heh , this gives us an <UNK> in our own <UNK> of <UNK> ."
<UNK> jews wo n't pronounce the word ; usually <UNK> <UNK> ( lord ) in it 's place .
"the early <UNK> understood that it was not a name in a traditional sense , but rather a formula ."
"this act was not finished in <#> days , as most of us interpret the biblical account ."
"this act is continuing at this present moment , and will continue to do so for all time ."
"<UNK> , christians rarely look past the surface of such things ."
"that is why we have <UNK> telling us that god 's name is <UNK> , or <UNK> ."
this leads us back to the trap of putting a face on god .
"if we think of <UNK> as a name like "" charlie "" or "" steve "" , then we miss the point entirely ."
"i hate to say this , but maybe <UNK> was closer to the truth than our current crop of holy men when he described the force ."
"someone once told me that anything you put after the words "" god is ... "" ends up being <UNK> own <UNK> ."
"i agree with that , but i also think it 's a useful exercise ."
""" god is ... "" a convenient ( but <UNK> ) <UNK> of the ultimate reality which is impossible for our minds to truly comprehend ."
"thinking of god in human terms may be useful for a child , but it 's gotten us adults into a holy mess ."
our army kills <UNK> <UNK> in the name of god .
<UNK> who fight back in the name of god .
"israel puts up a wall to defend itself from the "" <UNK> palestinians "" ."
do i need to remind anyone of the <UNK> ?
<UNK> performed in the name of god are <UNK> .
strap - on surprise i just stumbled <UNK> this and found it incredibly amusing !

i was <#> or <#> years older than i am today .
"i was staying in a small , <UNK> owned hotel or bed - and - breakfast ."
"i know this because the room was decorated as if it was somebody 's home , but it had room service ."
"there was a knock on my door and i called out "" come in ! """
"the door opened and a gorgeous <UNK> woman with a trim but <UNK> figure and <UNK> , <UNK> hair came in ."
"she said , "" i have your dinner , mr ."
"i said "" great ... bring it in . """
she rolled a cart in and <UNK> herself with the task of laying my meal out on the table .
"as she was finishing up , i decided to take a chance ."
"i said , "" you know , it 's been a while since a woman as lovely and as sexy as you paid this much attention to me . """
"she looked at me and then seemed to look me over again , taking her time ."
"she said , "" i find that hard to believe ... a guy as good looking as you probably gets plenty of attention . """
then she turned and started rolling the cart back towards the door .
"i spoke up and said "" no , really ... it has n't been like that ..."
"i mean , it 's just really been a while ... "" and i <UNK> off ."
"she looked over her shoulder at me , <UNK> her head and seemed to think about that for a second ."
"reaching behind her lovely behind , she lifted up her skirt ."
then she took <#> hand and slid the cloth of her panties to <#> side and gave me a <UNK> of heaven .
"she said , "" well , if it 's been too long since you 've seen this , take a good , long look . """
i <UNK> in wonder at the most amazing pussy i have ever seen .
"delicate <UNK> pink <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> away from a darker , ( <UNK> ? ) <UNK> ."
<UNK> for more and dreading the thought that she was going to go away in a moment . and
"so i said , "" can i get that heated up later ? "" and ( glory of <UNK> ! )"
"she said , "" do you want it now ? """
"and i said , "" yes , ... oh yes ! """
"then she locked the door , turned and started walking toward me , <UNK> her <UNK> as she came toward me ...."
and that 's when i woke up ... very ready for sex !
<UNK> ... a <UNK> - o - <UNK> of <UNK> excitement .
there are groups on the internet dedicated to keeping you informed if your favorite porn star might be available .
"find out if the dirty girl of your dreams could be spending time with you ... for a fee , of course ."
below is the link to <#> of these groups .
you understand that any <UNK> you may pay are solely for the time and <UNK> of the <UNK> sin star in question .
"anything else that might happen between <#> <UNK> adults is just a happy bonus of the moment , right ?"
more proof that some guys can get excited about any part of a woman 's body !
i just arrived home from my final day of <UNK> .
i 'm somewhat relieved its over but left with the battle scars .
"i was heavily <UNK> when i left however , they were irritating"
so i took them off and put on smaller ones that are less irritating ... for now .
the <#> on my head was particularly nasty .
<UNK> said that might happen but it does n't make any easier to deal with .
"i have a big weekend and now without my legs , its looking even bigger ."
but you all know me ... always a smile .
i have to believe that i meant to take this path and overcome these odds as a means of higher living ... better living .
"i leave you with my song of the day , jill scott 's golden : ok ( ay )"
i 'm living my life like it 's golden living my life like it 's golden living my life

rumor had it that <UNK> slept with the pigs in their <UNK> .
"he never spoke but was said to <UNK> and <UNK> , just like his pigs ."
the men <UNK> on the way to the fire that <UNK> would roast with his pigs because he was too stupid to escape .
"and , he began to feel guilty about <UNK> the man who 'd never done anything to him ."
"maybe he 's not really retarded , john <UNK> ."
"maybe he 's saving money from the sale of his pigs to move to florida , john suggested to the other <UNK> ."
not until they pulled <UNK> 's burned and <UNK> body from the fire did john <UNK> .
( maybe he had family in florida and was planning to join them there ) .
"for <UNK> , writing became an endless journey of trying to save <UNK> <UNK> , the title of his <#> <UNK> ."
a <UNK> habit of writing stories has <UNK> my own sense of recall and reality .
"as a small child , i escaped my own fears by writing stories of triumph and <UNK> and creating characters with courage and conviction ."
"before long , what really happened took second chair to what should have , what could have happened ."
"the real truth is that lynn will be well , healed , cancer - free ."
"what should be for her is health , peace , love and laughter ."
what could be for her is a world of endless possibilities .
"lynn is the most loving , giving and gentle soul i 've ever encountered ."
"my brain does not even know how to begin thinking about what is ; it is filled with stories of what should be , what could be ."
"as i sat talking with lynn today after day <#> of her week - long <UNK> , i took off my shoe and pointed to my foot ."
i 'd absent - <UNK> <UNK> it on the desk while sitting at the computer writing .
the <UNK> of my little bruise hit us simultaneously .
there i sat with a slightly <UNK> spot on my foot .
"you 're going to live . because if you were n't , i sure as hell would not be sitting here talking about my bruise ."
this week is filled with tests of strength and humanity for me .
my treatment <UNK> began with a bang so to speak .
i have no idea what shape all this medical crap will leave me in for my weekend adventure in nyc .
dream big dreams and hope for a bright tomorrow !
"when i lose my way or when i lose sight of my priorities , i turn to her words ."
the invitation has changed my life and it feeds my soul and serves as such a means of inspiration and that all too important kick in the ass .
the invitation it doesn’t interest me what you do for a living .
i want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart ’s longing .
i want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your dream for the adventure of being alive .
it doesn’t interest me what planets are <UNK> your moon ...
i want to know if you can sit with pain mine or your own without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it .
it doesn’t interest me if the story you are telling me is true .
i want to know if you can <UNK> another to be true to yourself .
if you can bear the <UNK> of <UNK> and not <UNK> your own soul .
if you can be <UNK> and therefore <UNK> .
i want to know if you can see beauty even when it is not pretty every day .
and if you can source your own life from its presence .
” it doesn’t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have .
it doesn’t interest me who you know or how you came to be here .
i want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back .
it doesn’t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied .
i want to know what <UNK> you from the inside when all else falls away .
i want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments .
today needs to be a brand new day in every sense of the word .
"i 'm not sure how it will turn out but at least today , i have hope for a tomorrow ."
i will leave you with <UNK> to begin your day .
i 've been through it all hit about a <#> walls welcome to my <UNK> i still love welcome to my <UNK> i still love
did you ever have <#> of those days that you would rather <UNK> your <UNK> out than go thru again ?
"aside from the recently normal pain and cancer related crap , i got to leave something very dear to me as a means of self <UNK> ."
"after over a year of <#> <UNK> slap in the face after another , it was just time ."
did you ever encounter people who live for drama ?
"well , these people made my life like really bad community theater ."
"there was all the name calling , reputation <UNK> and balls out <UNK> of a good 70s camp movie ."
"much like a <UNK> movie , these characters think they have a leg up or have gotten the better of you ..."
it was a day that makes you look and feel like this : now where is my coffee ?
the best thing to come from yesterday was the following quote i found while being <UNK> from lack of clean air
: i 've gone to look for myself .
"if i should return before i get back , keep me here ."
what on earth am i doing with a blog ? ?
"well i 'll tell you ... in the last year or so , there have been so many <UNK> about me floating around ..."
people think they know but they have no idea .
this also gives me the opportunity to discuss <UNK> and life - works that matter to me .
"we had talked since our first meeting , online of course ."
"just <#> days after that eventful day , we made <UNK> to meet at his house on a sunday afternoon ."
"they only had <#> car and he took her to work , so we would n't be interrupted ."
"when he finally released me from his kiss , he took my hand and led me into the bedroom ."
"he took off my dress , then stopped to <UNK> at my huge breasts ."
"he told me they were the biggest , <UNK> , most beautiful he 'd ever seen ."
he rubbed his thumb across my nipples and was pleased when they were instantly hard .
"he <UNK> took off my bra in <#> quick motion , then buried his face in my <UNK> ."
he took each <UNK> in his mouth and <UNK> at my breast .
he <UNK> between my nipples until they were both standing at attention and aching for more .
"he 'd suck on them , rolling them with his tongue and <UNK> at them gently with his teeth ."
"then he 'd pull back and gently blow them dry with his breath , then start all over again ."
"i nearly came from his <UNK> <UNK> , and he had n't even touched the lower half of my body ."
"he did n't dive right in , as i had expected ."
instead he joined me in bed and kissed me some more .
he let me <UNK> him and explore his body .
i enjoyed his nipples much the way he had enjoyed mine and it was my pleasure to see him respond .
"only then did he start working his way down my body , kissing and licking every inch of the way ."
"when he got to my pussy , he pushed my thighs apart"
oh - so - gently and took his time exploring the area .
"he kissed all the way around my tender , now swollen , parts ."
he blew hot air on my <UNK> and watched my reaction .
then he moved his mouth to my dripping hot hole .
i ca n't begin to describe the magic that took place at that moment .
he was quite simply an absolute master at the art of <UNK> .
he <UNK> and sucked <UNK> until i thought i would go mad .
"just when i thought i would die if he did n't enter me , i felt the sweet sensation of his fingers moving inside me ."
he touched places inside me that i did n't even know existed .
my body <UNK> as the explosion ripped through me .
i had never in my life felt anything so intense .
"having satisfied me so thoroughly , he kissed his way back up to my mouth and covered it with his , letting me taste my own cum ."
i wanted him inside me now and begged him to fuck me .
he grabbed a condom and searched for the perfect position to enter me .
"it did n't take him long , but he apparently had an <UNK> to <UNK> and was quickly <UNK> ."
he did n't like condoms and neither did his <UNK> .
"i told him it did n't matter , and proceeded to suck him dry ."
i loved the way his cock felt in my mouth .
i enjoyed having the power to make him cum .
"i left that day a happy woman , but wondered if there was something wrong with me that he could n't stay hard long enough to fuck me ."
"i wondered if there would be another chance , or if he 'd had all he wanted of this piece of tail ."
i was getting hooked and i did n't know what to do to stop it ... or if i wanted to .
"it 's so cliche now , but back then , it was novel ."
"i believe the exact words on my profile were that i was looking for someone to "" rock my world "" ."
"he was <#> years my junior , just <#> years old , and married ."
he too was looking for a <#> night stand .
we talked for a couple of nights then we decided to meet late <#> night to <UNK> our internet <UNK> .
"his wife was out of town , so we met at his house ."
i was less than impressed with what he had to offer .
"there was no oral sex , which was a personal favorite of mine ."
<#> kiss and some breast <UNK> was the extent of the <UNK> .
"<UNK> , i 'd only been with <#> man my whole life and i knew more about sex than this guy !"
"this was not what i was looking for , although i did n't really know what i was looking for !"
"suffice it to say , my world was not rocked ."
"a little older than seth , but only only by <#> or <#> years ."
i picked him up in my van when he was supposed to be going to the gym .
at least that 's what he told his wife .
"we decided to find a quiet place to park , and well , have sex ."
i was <UNK> because i had started my period earlier in the day .
we drove around for awhile until we found what we thought was the perfect spot .
we got in the <UNK> and he went to town on my boobs .
"that 's when i realized he had the smallest dick i had ever seen , even on tv or in magazines ."
it was so thin ... about the <UNK> of a magic marker .
i was n't even sure he was in me .
"yes , it was the wonderful county <UNK> 's office ."
"after <UNK> us for about <#> minutes , they let us off with a warning ."
i refused to answer his calls and his instant messages .
i was n't sure this was what i wanted to do anymore .
he became threatening and i was certain i did n't want to continue anything with him .
"this was just scary , not exciting and definitely not the kind of world rockin ' i was looking for ."
"a few weeks later , i chatted with bill ."
"he was couple of years older than me , married and very experienced ."
he <UNK> that he had been cheating his entire <#> year marriage and had gotten very good at it .
"on the <UNK> of the moment , we decided to meet at a local <UNK> <UNK> , something i had never done ."
he told his wife he had to pick up a friend who 'd had too much to drink .
"he was no <UNK> , that was for sure ."
this was a better experience than the first <#> .
"he was a <UNK> and had a very nice , <UNK> body ."
he started with a kiss ( just <#> ) and slowly worked my clothes off .
"he kissed his way down my body , right to my waiting , wet pussy ."
he worked at my <UNK> until i came all over his face .
i could hear his breathing get more shallow as became excited .
i took all of him in my mouth at once and began <UNK> with my mouth and my tongue .
"just when i thought he was going to explode , he grabbed me and threw me on the bed , on all <UNK> ...."
with <#> quick <UNK> he was <UNK> behind me and thrust deep inside me .
he reached forward and <UNK> my breasts as he <UNK> away .
it did n't take long before he shot his load and collapsed on top of me .
we laid in bed for quite awhile afterwards talking and <UNK> .
"he talked <UNK> about his wife , his numerous <UNK> , etc ."
"we decided on <#> quick <UNK> performance , then got dressed to go home ."
this time i went home more or less <UNK> .
he had made it <UNK> clear that this would be a <#> time only <UNK> .
"since i did n't really feel anything for him other than good old fashioned lust , that was fine ."
it 's hard to rock someone 's world in just <#> night .
"then , the next week , i met him ."
he sent me a message that he could definitely rock my world .
i had heard this about a <#> times before and it made me giggle .
"he was intelligent , funny and knew how to talk dirty , without being disgusting and/or insulting ."
"i was <UNK> surprised to find out that he lived nearby and really could try to make good on his promise to "" rock my world "" ."
we made arrangements to meet briefly the next day .
i was at work when i first laid eyes on him .
my boss was out of town and had left me in charge of the office .
"it was positively dead during the day , so i knew it would be a safe place to meet ."
i remember trying to concentrate on reading the paper to make the time go by faster .
i was so nervous to see what he actually looked like .
he walked in the door and immediately locked the door behind him .
"this normally would have <UNK> me , but i was so <UNK> by his stunning good looks that i barely noticed ."
he was quite simply the most beautiful man i had ever seen .
"he was of asian <UNK> and i would later learn he was half japanese , half scottish ."
"he had gorgeous thick , <UNK> black hair <UNK> with gray , and a nicely <UNK> <UNK> and beard ."
"his beautiful bedroom eyes were a deep , warm , chocolate brown ."
"he had near perfect teeth , straight and almost movie - star white ."
his lips were full and <UNK> and incredibly <UNK> .
"his body was n't perfect , but i loved what i saw ."
"he was <UNK> "" and <UNK> over my <UNK> "" frame ."
he crossed the short distance between us and kissed me lightly on the lips .
he handed me the rose he had brought me .
"still lost in his male beauty , i pulled him close for a deeper kiss ."
"his tongue instantly <UNK> and <UNK> my mouth , <UNK> in and out of the <UNK> without being too <UNK> ."
i had to break for air because i was becoming <UNK> .
his hand traveled to my breasts and i could feel the heat of his touch .
he asked me to sit down and <UNK> me to my desk chair .
"he <UNK> my <UNK> through my panties for a minute or <#> , commenting on how my pussy must be happy to see him ."
he pushed the thin material aside and <UNK> his fingers into my aching pussy .
with his thumb he <UNK> my <UNK> as he continued to massage my pussy walls with his fingers .
i ca n't remember even being capable of thought at this point .
he was patient and it was obvious he enjoyed this task .
he <UNK> <UNK> phrases about the things he wanted to do to me .
"he told me how hot and wet my pussy was , and how he loved the way my sex smelled ."
"he continued to <UNK> me , slowly increasing the gentle , <UNK> pressure on my hot button ."
finally i exploded in a <UNK> of <UNK> pleasure .
"when i could breathe normally again , i opened my eyes and was greeted by the most beautiful self - satisfied smile ."
i knew i had to taste him .
i wanted the sensation of his cock in my mouth .
i wanted to return the same kind of amazing pleasure he had given me .
i <UNK> his pants and pushed him against the edge of the desk in front of me and i remained seated in my chair .
i released his <UNK> <UNK> from it 's fabric cage .
it was a beautiful sight to behold ... <#> and half inches long and at least <#> inches thick .
the skin tone <UNK> and was deeper in color closer to his body .
i stuffed as much of him as i could into my hungry mouth .
he tasted even better than i could have imagined !
"his <UNK> of pleasure and his hand <UNK> my hair , pushing me into his sex , drove me into a frenzy ."
i simply had to make him cum .
i worked my tongue up and down the sides of his thick cock .
he whispered <UNK> naughty phrases to me as i <UNK> him .
he had the <UNK> damn voice i 'd ever heard .
i <UNK> my tongue in and out of the little <UNK> at the top .
i <UNK> sucking just the head of his penis and then deep <UNK> as much of him as i could .
i <UNK> his ball <UNK> and <UNK> it as i sucked and <UNK> .
"and i was rewarded with the sweet , <UNK> taste of his cum hitting the back of my throat ."
"when he had recovered , he stood up , <UNK> his pants and his belt , tucked in his shirt and pulled me into a standing position ."
he kissed me deeply and told me this was just the beginning .
he said he wanted to stay longer but he had to get to work .
"i walked him to the door , he kissed me <#> last time and then he left ."
later he <UNK> to me how he had noticed that his <UNK> had left a stain on the front of his <UNK> .
he 'd had to aim the <UNK> from the car 's <UNK> on his pants trying to dry the wet spot before he got to work .
"i was floating on air , and i could n't wait to talk to him again ."
"more importantly , i could n't wait to actually fuck him and feel him moving inside me ."
"i must have <UNK> <#> times that day , each time <UNK> the feel of his cock in mouth and his fingers in my pussy ."
i have n't talked to him in about a week .
"i could tell right away that he was horny , which is often when he calls ."
"he told me that i was good at giving head ( i knew that ) . that he loved my big , soft breasts ."
he <UNK> the way my legs would stretch all the way out when i came .
i get angry at myself because his words <UNK> me .
i hate that he can pull that type of reaction from me .
we were only together <#> months before he cast me aside .
he 's been in <#> relationships since then and they both lasted far longer than ours .
does he call them too and whisper <UNK> memories in their ears ?
how does he sort through the memories and <UNK> the proper ones to each of us ?
i must not have made much of an impact on him since he had absolutely no trouble leaving me behind .
he had no <UNK> about letting me know that they were better in bed .
"both of his more recent loves are more beautiful , <UNK> and younger than me ."
"i ca n't imagine why he would choose to <UNK> those memories of me , when he 's obviously had hotter sex with them ."
because he knows i 'm still good for a quick sexual fantasy for him to <UNK> to . because i 'm <UNK> alone ...
<#> years after he kicked me out of his bed .
i thought i 'd buried all those sexual memories of him .
"but when he does this , they all come rushing back ."
"he made me feel so very sexy , and i was so free with him ."
"nothing seemed out of <UNK> , wrong or <UNK> ."
"then , i start remembering the beginning of the end ."
suddenly he did n't feel ' right ' sleeping with me .
i blame his super religious mom ... she was really laying a guilt trip on him about us .
but there were other issues ... ones that would never be resolved .
he was incredibly jealous of the ones who came before him .
it did n't matter that he was the <#> i wanted to be with now .
"finally , feeling neglected , <UNK> and <UNK> , i moved out ."
i know now that by then he had already met his next girlfriend and she had taken my place in his bed within a week of my departure .
"i had given up everything for him and he had simply cast me aside , as if i were nothing ."
"so great was my need for him , that i became his ' best friend ' since i could not be his lover ."
for <#> years i listened to him <UNK> over his relationship with the new girlfriend .
i spent hours on the phone with him into the wee hours of the night as he obsessed over every <UNK> of their affair .
"since she was married and he was now cast in the role of the ' other man ' , i <UNK> ... filling his weekends with <UNK> ."
"i guess i was pretending we were still together , even though i knew it was n't true ."
"i had such hope that now that we had a sexual relationship again , that it would all come back ."
he would call me late at night and whisper an <UNK> invitation .
i would be on his <UNK> and in his bed in minutes .
"there were no kisses , no sweet <UNK> and naughty laughter , no <UNK> in the <UNK> ."
"the sex was rough , to the point , and all for him ."
"all this time , he was still seeing her ."
"how ironic , that he was now cheating on her , with me ."
if only she knew how little it actually had to do with me .
it was all about his anger at her for being <UNK> .
"this was sex at it 's worst , and it most certainly was not love ."
it would take the fingers on both hands to count the number of men i slept with after him .
i 'm not proud of this ... it just is .
trying to erase the memory of how his body felt pressed next to mine .
how his tongue could send <UNK> down my spine .
trying to <UNK> the taste and feel of him in my mouth .
trying to drown out the dirty little things he said that drove me wild .
he used to tell me how much he loved my body while he was fucking me .
"the way he would suck my nipples just hard enough to make me <UNK> , but not hard enough to hurt ."
"i loved they way his belly <UNK> out just so , softly <UNK> yet rock solid underneath ."
i <UNK> the power in his thighs that promised deep <UNK> and delicious satisfaction .
i <UNK> at the way the skin below his waist was darker than the skin above .
when i was more than just a hole or a mouth for him to stick his cock into .
"the men that came after , none could measure up to my expectations ."
i had experienced love and raw passion at it 's very best .
"it did n't help that i chose <UNK> , <UNK> partners ."
"finally , i did the only thing i could do ."
i transferred with my company to a city <#> states away .
at first he called daily . especially when he was fighting with the girlfriend .
"slowly the calls died down to once a week , then twice a month ."
"eventually , after <#> long years , she let him go ."
it was everything i had n't been able to do .
"so , since he was depressed and scared of what the future would hold , i once again became his <UNK> ... albeit a long distance <#> ."
"i encouraged him , <UNK> him , and even gave him suggestions on putting himself on the market , so to speak ."
he came to visit me ! after not seeing him for a year and half
", i got <#> and a half days of his company ."
he played this game of acting like he did n't want to touch me . perhaps because he knew it was exactly what i wanted .
it had been a long time since i 'd had an <UNK> touch and
"finally , mere hours before he left town , he <UNK> to let me touch him ."
"this quickly led to sex , or his version of it ."
"it was every bit as <UNK> , rough and <UNK> as it had been the last time we 'd had sex , the night before i left town ."
"the very next day , while he was visiting his brother in a nearby city , he met his next girlfriend on a blind date ."
she was <UNK> and he was entirely too used to living alone .
the difference in their ages came up more often than not .
but still he was determined to make it work .
of course i offered advice when he needed a sounding board .
"almost a year to the day , she walked out on him ."
took everything that was n't <UNK> down in the house and left .
"he was shocked , pissed , hurt .... but mostly relieved ."
"now , they 've made up but she has n't moved back in ."
he talks of moving to our state so they can be together .
of course he tells me he mostly wants to move here so he can live closer to me .
"except now , i know better than to believe it ."
yet he still has the power to make me wet with his words ... with the memories .
"when i least expect it , memories of him leap from the shadows of my mind ."
he was the <#> who discovered i was multi - <UNK> .
"he quickly understood that if he 'd just wait a minute or <#> , it was n't quite so painfully sensitive ."
"he could then lick or stroke my <UNK> yet ready pussy until he produced another bed - shaking , sheet - soaking explosion ."
he said he loved the <UNK> expression of <UNK> pleasure that came across my <UNK> when he had so fully satisfied me .
i remember how it felt to have his hot cum <UNK> deep inside of me .
i actually thought we were meant to be together .

"take it from your uncle red , tiff , business <UNK> that different from third grade except the cafeteria is better and they serve coffee ."
"dear tiffany , thanks for your email <UNK> me for the graduation present ."
"truth is , what i 'd really like to do is pay for another semester of college to delay your entering the real world but that ai n't happening ."
instead i hope it fits ' cause the <UNK> has found its way into my expenses file for tax purposes .
"congratulations , you 're officially considered "" <UNK> publicity expenses "" ."
please tell someone about my company or i 'm going to jail .
"anyway , you asked for some advice to make you wildly successful in business ."
"it 's a fine name if you 're a stained glass window , not so good if you want to be taken seriously in business ."
"<UNK> are not named tiffany , nor are they kyle nor brittany ."
"they 're named <UNK> , or tom or bill ."
"in san jose they 're frequently called <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> , but they are the hindi equivalent of <UNK> , or tom or bill ."
there is no known <UNK> equivalent to tiffany and for very good reason .
"that 's probably not really helpful in the long run , so let me see if i can pull a pearl out of my <UNK> hat ."
"as the great marcus <UNK> says , "" be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter , and think that even such a result is no <UNK> . """
this does not mean be satisfied with <UNK> in <UNK> it means take your <UNK> when you can get them and realize you 'll lose more than you win .
think about it- if you 're a baseball player getting <#> hit out of <#> for your career will put you in the hall of fame .
"well , i gave that address to everyone i know ."
best friend <UNK> warned me at the time that it was dangerous to do so .
needing an outlet and feeling like i have no where to turn with my thoughts .
good week to start and a great day to start ( fri the 13th . )
i will <UNK> the <UNK> because i am that <UNK> this week .
"today , no ... scratch that ... this week has tried me hard . too hard for my liking ."
i am a bit of an <UNK> free spirit .
i would like to let things roll off my back .
i would like to be that gal that does n't get hurt easily .
i am trying through my creativity to explore all the questions that lead me to <UNK> <UNK> myself .
am i a good person or do i just play <#> on tv ?
do i worry more about giving or getting .
i would have previously said ( and many others would too ) that i give more .
i do n't take care of my needs very well which then <UNK> in that <UNK> behavior just mentioned .
i worry about what others think of me .
i worry that i will never live the life i think i am destined to .
i have lived a life of worrying and not even knowing that i was doing it .
i thought the fruit fell in the middle of the trees .
"but alas , on days like today , i am very aware that i am exactly like my mother in all the wrong ways ."
"but the truth is that prior to <#> years ago , i never really got that ."
i thought it was an idea invented so that women could be bitchy .
"but <UNK> , i started to notice that i would go a bit <UNK>"
"and the weirdest thing about the pms is that i never <UNK> it to pms until i have done the damage and then i am like , """
i used to say that i am so dramatic in my <UNK> .
i am dramatic in my own drama of the mind .
a theater production brought to you by hormones .
i work in hollywood . for a company that makes movies .
i love the people in my department for the most part .
"we , who are left after a bold sweep earlier this year got more work placed upon us ."
i am a creative type who after being unemployed for over a year felt very grateful for this job in a non - creative position .
it was only supposed to get me on my feet after <#> months .
i work for <#> <UNK> who are at the lowest <UNK> but feel compelled to <UNK> their power over me .
"i have had <UNK> , thoughts of suicide , passive - aggressive matches with them , until finally this week"
"like a child who has been tortured by her <UNK> and then finally says to her mom , """
i would n't have done it except i was ready to walk .
i ended up talking to the big boss after the <UNK> and i had a very public display yelling at eachother .
i had to go to hr and tell my side of things .
"events could end up being as good as they feel now , or i could be completely in the dark about what i think is going on right now ."
it did n't occur to me until yesterday that i am <UNK> .
"maybe it took me being emotionally <UNK> to the point of shouting "" i am not your child ! "" in a legal department ."
maybe the reason things feel soo <UNK> and emotional right now ( besides the obvious ) is that i am supposed to stand up for myself .
i am supposed to be the individual that i am <UNK> to be .
it is exhausting standing up for yourself if you are not used to it .
but now ... it all feels a little less heavy .
the stars are <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> me .
i listen to <UNK> 's sounds <UNK> and it sets a nice tone for my day .
tonight i am going to a spoken word event that i am very excited about .
last week a tour group came to the church .
"they were from a church from another town , and were members of a different <UNK> ."
at <#> point everyone was gathered around the altar .
<#> lady asked what we do around the altar .
she got to the heart of what she really wanted to know .
i told her : jesus invited everyone to his table so we invite everyone to god 's table .
we give communion to everyone by <UNK> without exception .
"she was polite about my response , but clearly <UNK> ."
you mean you do n't have to be confirmed ?
"no , baptism is full membership in our church ."
"oh , so you do at least require baptism ?"
"no , we do n't require that either ."
that small exchange revealed the core issue : who is worthy to receive the <UNK> ?
"i did my best to explain , to reveal our community 's understanding and values , but we did nt ' get very far ."
our versions of how to live the faith simply did n't match up .
she was more concerned with <UNK> the <UNK> rules of institution of christianity .
i am more interested in the faith continues to live and breathe right in our midst .
i do n't believe the faith needs to be <UNK> but i do believe that <UNK> christianity works overtime trying to protect itself .
usually i think it is trying to protect itself from the spirit .
"i believe that as we continue to practice our faith and touch the reality of what it means to live a human life , our beliefs change ."
we do n't need to be afraid of this .
"in the course of our study and practice , as we touch reality more and more deeply , our beliefs naturally <UNK> and become more solid ."
"when our beliefs are based on our own direct experience of reality and not on <UNK> offered by others , no <#> can shake them from us ."
making a <UNK> commitment to a concept is much more dangerous .
it can not be just a set of <UNK> beliefs and <UNK> .
"our faith must <UNK> every day and bring us joy , peace , freedom , and love ."
"faith implies practice , living our daily life in <UNK> ."
some people think that prayer involves only our minds or our hearts .
"but we also have to pray with our bodies , with our actions in the world ."
and our actions must be <UNK> after those of the living christ .
"excerpt from a recent sermon on luke <#> - <#> in <UNK> , a <UNK> girl <UNK> for baptism in the <UNK> church ."
her parents <UNK> <UNK> to her decision to become a christian .
"a few weeks before her scheduled baptism , her parents had her killed ."
"when i was in college , <#> of my jewish friends converted to christianity ."
his parents responded by publicly <UNK> him dead and hold public funeral for him so their friends could join in the mourning .
my colleague nancy <UNK> was called to be pastor of a southern baptist church in <UNK> .
she was the first woman to hold such a position .
the county baptist association threw the church of out of the association .
later that same year the national baptist convention <UNK> all ties with that church .
like the parents who raise their kids to be doctors and lawyers .
"they think <UNK> almost succeeded when the last <#> <UNK> he wants to be a minister , and their faces fall ."
these are painful stories for any of us who have close family ties and who also hold deep religious <UNK> .
"christ ’s invitation to follow him can divide a family , even destroy a family ."
what is so disturbing about these stories is that jesus does not say they should not be so .
"he says they are inevitable , that the gospel is inherently <UNK> and that we should not be surprised when we fight about it ."
"ever seen that the bumper sticker or the t - shirt that says , “ dear jesus , protect me from your followers ” ?"
i don’t fear the government ( too much ) or the dreaded forces of <UNK> or <UNK> .
well - funded religious and political leaders in certain <UNK> of the population promote an aggressive “ spiritual warfare ” against those who will not be <UNK> among them .
not too long ago there was a story of college seniors being <UNK> at night campus security from the library to their <UNK> because “ christian ”
students had spoken about the kinds of things that should happen to people like them if they were caught alone at night .
"no direct threat , just the creation of a <UNK> atmosphere in which to live ."
maybe luke was conscious of the growing <UNK> between the followers of jesus and other jews in his time .
or maybe he was well aware that roman law would not grant legal standing to the newly <UNK> christian faith .
maybe he knew christians who were <UNK> in the street or forbidden to attend family <UNK> with jewish relatives .
but could have imagined the waves of <UNK> <UNK> by christians throughout the ages ?
i think of matthew <UNK> who was <UNK> beaten and his body <UNK> to a fence in <UNK> <UNK> because he was gay .
he was <UNK> killed by kids who celebrated their form of christianity .
we think these kinds of incidents are easy to <UNK> .
"we say to ourselves , “ this is not christianity , but a <UNK> of its deepest truths ."
but is also true that we so easily fail to communicate <UNK> the most simple of its truths : all persons are created in the image of god .
i suspect all of us have probably experienced painful division at <#> time or another in our own families .
"trouble is , the deepest <UNK> are to be found within christianity right now ."
so it makes sense that the claims of christ may all too often call us to stand in opposition to our friends and parents or brothers and sisters .
how do we stay in communion with those whose vision of god and god ’s claim upon their lives is different form our own ?
"first , be faithful to the voice of god you hear within you ."
to deny it is to die to your own integrity .
"second , and more important , resist the temptation to claim for yourself more understanding than those with whom you disagree ."
perhaps you can be helped to hear the voice of god they hear .
sir anthony and i where just <#> of its <UNK> success stories and there are many <UNK> stories of love and alternative lifestyle adventures in its history .
here are some simple rules to follow : please be <UNK> to all those around you .
"always be respectful , the golden rule counts everywhere but especially here ! no flaming ."
"no <#> <UNK> this , please do this somewhere else ."
always ask before going into someones private chat .
"remember everyone has their own lives , <UNK> , and <UNK> ; please be respectful to everyones opinions ."
no <UNK> no <#> likes it and it is really not acceptable in the <UNK> lifestyle .
i think all the <UNK> and <UNK> that find the room will agree with me.. <UNK> :)
"i am most <UNK> that you have gone to the effort and commitment to carry forward what <UNK> and i have come to call "" the room ."
hey you guys have done an awsome job on this room <UNK> 's fun spending time here .

"it was starting to heat up but i sometimes have bar add , so ..."
"<UNK> du <UNK> <#> ( <#> ) shot <UNK> - $ <#> gold cane dead , and the people who we came to <UNK> gone ."
but i did get a chance to say hello to a lovely bartender i had n't seen in months .
"moaning like all hell . and ... <#> ( <#> ) guy on a motorcycle - late <UNK> , white ."
talking to both a <#> <UNK> and his friend at the same time .
the guy was <UNK> his friend and saying that he 'd be okay .
but it sounded like he was going to leave him before the cops got there
so i decided to stay just to be sure the guy did n't <UNK> .
"and <UNK> he might have , because he was drunk and because he 'd just ran over his friend ."

it all started with a simple plan ; get groceries .
but i ran into my brother and things went terribly <UNK> .

i think this place used to be red 's java house .

you may have noticed ; i spend a lot of time in bars .
the first <UNK> experiment was conducted purely on free time .
"<UNK> the first : <UNK> kid , <UNK> for sneaking alcohol , was introduced to me as someone who would not be returning , promptly fell on his face ."
he spent the rest of the evening passed out in a pool of vomit face down in the parking lot .
his friends left him there and went back in to see the show .
moral : either stop being an asshole or get better friends .
after hours <#> ( <#> ) <UNK> <UNK> - a double .
"<UNK> the second cab ride home , went to close the cab door and was <UNK> with a handful of someone 's half <UNK> dinner ."

"the after party <#> ( <#> ) bottle <UNK> - <UNK> , yo ."
the police had been by the party before i got there .
"it was breaking up , but still i got see about a dozen peeps from all over the city before i <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , i was looking forward to seeing the sun come up . back at the ranch <#> ( <#> ) lamb <UNK> - drunken cooking style ."
there were actually <#> but i dropped <#> on the floor .
at least i was n't drunk enough to eat it .
total cost for the evening : $ <#> - i win !
<#> ( <#> ) <#> <UNK> salmon - tasty .
"<#> ( <#> ) lamb <UNK> - okay , but no <UNK> ."
neither myself nor my roommate have anything even remotely related to a green thumb .
"well , i 'm starting up the <UNK> consumption project once more ."
i will list everything i consume everyday in the hopes that it will help me ( and maybe <UNK> you from such <UNK> ) .
help me understand where it is that my money goes and help me be conscious of what i do to my body .
the previous versions of the <UNK> project ( started in <#> ) were conducted at a time when i had considerably more <UNK> income and also considerably more debt .
i think that this time will be an interesting take on the subject .
i do n't know what 's up with me .
"but , for some reason i ca n't get out of this funk ."
"at work , i only do what i need to get by ."
"at home , i do n't answer the phone ."
"clean my house , have a drink and <UNK> out in front of the tv ."
"i know i should go work out , but do n't have the energy to do it ."
it 's only across the parking lot from me !
"i know it would make me feel better , look better and it 's free ."
i 'm tired all of the time and just want to sleep .
"i 'm already on <UNK> , and have <UNK> my prescription once already this year !"
"have n't been to the shrink in awhile , but i do n't think she was doing anything for me anymore ."
"she use to recommend self help books , now she <UNK> <UNK> novels with characters that do things i would do !"
i was n't looking for another gal pal !
"i 've cut way back on spending money and still , ca n't get ahead !"
i guess it 's because i am still not use to having to pay rent !
i have n't had to for the past <#> years .
"i 'm pretty much use to spending what i want , when i want !"
"no more stupid shit for me , which sucks ! !"
i have n't bought a new pair of shoes since april !
"and , i 'm use to buying at least <#> pair a week ! thinking about getting a part time job during the holidays ."
"weight issues : if i were to spend more time working out , i would look better , feel better , sleep better etc ."
"i know all of that , i just am having a hard time finding the motivation to get off my ass and do it !"
"then , that brings me back to issue # <#> and being stressed about debt !"
"friends : i 've lost touch with some of my friends since the "" break - up "" ."
"there is a whole group that were "" his "" friends and a group that <UNK> mine ."
here 's the thing ... most of my friends are married !
which was fine when i was in a relationship and thought that i was in a similar place as my married friends .
"now , i find that i do n't have as much interest in looking at toys , baby clothes , talking about child birth , their kids etc ."
"not to mention feel like a 3rd wheel when doing things with them , or the fucking <UNK> ."
"now that i 'm single , i realize that i have very few friends that are single too ! which is a bit depressing !"
i guess i 'm just feeling alone and sorry for myself .
hopefully tomorrow will be a better and brighter day !
why do i feel like i did n't get a weekend ?
i did n't do a damn thing all weekend .
"left the house <#> times , did n't answer the phone or call anyone ."
"today , i feel like i could sleep for the rest of the week ."
"i need to work out , take drugs or something ! the ex was suppose to come by this weekend and drop off the rest of my shit ."
did n't feel like dealing with him or being nice .
"after all , do you know how many times i had to wait on his ass for a call returned ? lots !"
"let the bastard think i was "" to busy "" ."
is he just a fuck buddy or is this going somewhere ? okay ... a little history !
just got out of an <#> year relationship that ended in january .
he just kind of decided he was n't happy and had n't been for the past year .
"was <UNK> for about a month , cried a lot , drank a lot"
", then got my shit together , moved out and moved on ."
"realizing that it would have never worked out in the long run , it was a blessing in disguise and all of that other crap !"
"so then ... meet a guy at a bar in may ( i know , never a good sign . )"
"gave him my number , he called the next week ."
"talked for awhile , we both had plans to be out of town the next <#> - <#> weekends ."
decided to get together when we were both back in town .
"in the meantime , i 'm close to his house , at a bar , call him up around midnight and he comes to meet me for a drink ."
i have to say i did n't regret a single moment of it .
"so , we 're suppose to go out the following weekend , i do n't hear from him ."
"left him the "" what is up with you ? "" message ."
"hear from him again the following week , i ask if we are done here <UNK> what ."
"he says not at all , blah blah blah , i cave and ask him to come over ."
"says he 's been out of town for <#> weeks , coming home tonight , let 's get together soon ."
"we both go out town the following weekend , ( not together ) , he calls when he gets back and stays over ."
"i do like him , but really do n't know him all that well , or what his deal is ."
"we get along great , are very attracted to each other , are totally comfortable with each other , which we both admitted was a little creepy ."
"he says he 's a very "" private "" person , which i interpret as "" a lying , cheating , <UNK> bastard ."
""" i found myself actually trying to catch him in lies ."
( i think because my ex use to lie about stupid shit all the time . )
"which you would think would be a good sign , but it just <UNK> me ."
each year there are nearly <#> persons reported missing and entered into the fbi database .
over <#> - <UNK> of these individuals are minor children .
i expect that more recent data will show similar results when it is made available .
why let your mind be distracted and <UNK> with these <UNK> <UNK> media soap <UNK> ?
"actually load up in your suv with your hiking boots and <UNK> and personally , physically help in the search effort ."
"what ever you do , don’t just sit on your rear end , <UNK> in front of the tv and <UNK> about the sentence the <UNK> should receive ."
"they 've heard and they feel , but they don’t think ."
the final <UNK> usually occurs when my <UNK> ends the conversation by admitting that they are either not registered to vote or have not voted in years .
<UNK> <UNK> and lori hacking would probably have appreciated your efforts .
"dead celebrities <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> - more later ..."
olympic sized ego ’s and <UNK> professional athletes what ’s more <UNK> or <UNK> ?
"by the looks of the makeup and performance of the current us men ’s basketball team , talent is not the answer ."
"not that anyone ever asked me , but i have never <UNK> much to the idea of allowing professional athletes to form the core of an olympic team ."
"but , when the rules changed ( in <#> , i think , )"
i somehow knew in the back of my mind that this <UNK> would most likely <UNK> the <UNK> of the us olympic basketball effort .
i think that the performance to date of this year ’s men ’s team represents the <UNK> of my somewhat <UNK> prediction .
there are <#> nba players that make up the men ’s us olympic basketball team .
a little research on the web reveals that the <#> - <#> salary of the top <#> players <UNK> $ <#> .
"finally , detailed news reports from south florida are coming out as the media is allowed access to the areas most affected by hurricane <UNK> ."
"among the <UNK> stories of death , injury , and loss of property , are amazing tales of miracles and of survival ."
"and of course there is also the latest round of expressions of <UNK> from the politicians , media , and bleeding heart liberals <UNK> tactics of “ price <UNK> ."
” governor bush and the florida attorney general are even threatening the arrest and <UNK> of anyone caught “ price <UNK> .
"i know you left <UNK> out there are going to have your head spinning around as i attempt to address this topic ,"
"so , in an attempt to be “ fair and balanced ” ( sorry fox news )"
i’ll just go ahead and express your description of <UNK> about “ <UNK> ” and “ selfish ” or even “ ignorant ” and “
"” any way , let ’s look at <UNK> policies in a free market economy ."
"at that time of the year the overnight hotel <UNK> were a few retired couples , the front desk clerk , and myself ."
"this same room , according to the room rate card , would rent for $ <#> per night in july ."
what is the <UNK> factor in the room <UNK> ?
d - e - m - a - n - d !
so now let ’s change the product and the circumstances with another example .
suppose i live in atlanta and run a moving company .
"business is slow , it ’s the middle of the month , and a hurricane hits south florida ."
everything is legal and on the up - and - up .
that ten - dollar <UNK> now will cost you <#> dollars . that $ <#> chain saw
a $ <#> sheet of <UNK> is $ <#> and a $ <#> generator is $ <#> .
"by the way , the local home depot and ace hardware had their <UNK> blown off and have sold out of <UNK> chain <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"boy will everyone be glad to see us , right ?"
"wrong -- you <UNK> , arrogant , white libertarian ."
"“ we’ll arrest you and sue , ” cry the politicians ."
"what am i doing in my <UNK> policies that aren’t equal to the <UNK> policies set by the hotel <UNK> , sports <UNK> , and <UNK> ?"
"no <#> is holding a gun to your head to make you pay my price , are they ?"
"if my products were n't made available by my efforts and expenses , there would be no products to buy . as i stated earlier ,"
"price , in a free market economy , is set by product <UNK> and product demand ."
"yes , if i were the red cross or just a <UNK> minded individual i could sell these items at cost or even give them away ."
and i might just choose to share my profits by <UNK> a few units of each product to truly needy individuals .
let the churches and <UNK> take care of the needy .
"they could have lived and worked further <UNK> , bought a retirement home in a state other than florida , or whatever ."
"then upon buying a home , they could have looked into the new building codes and made <UNK> and <UNK> in order to meet the increased standards ."
""" new cars , expensive tennis shoes , and disney vacations all took priority over disaster preparation ."
"in essence , they “ <UNK> ” on not needing these necessary "" <UNK> "" and they lost , big time ."
"now they find themselves paying the current real cost of these items , based on the current real market value and they are looking for someone else to blame ."
the present movement of hurricane <UNK> is of particular interest to me and my neighbors as it slides across the florida <UNK> this evening toward our homes on st .
current local <UNK> are for winds only in the <#> to <UNK> mph range .
"we are , however , <UNK> every <#> or <#> years with the possibility of the strike of a <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> of a storm ."
it seems that i have arrived back home from a vacation in chicago today just in time for such an event .
the first sign of trouble was that the grocery lot was virtually full of <UNK> and suv 's upon my arrival .
the next obvious clue was the <UNK> of only <#> shopping <UNK> inside the front door of the store .
the biggest personal blow was that the peter pan peanut butter was sold out entirely ( i had to buy <UNK> . )
do gas up the car or suv and move it to high ground prior to the local roads being closed .
do n't venture out <UNK> the storm onto flooded roads in high winds at break <UNK> <UNK> in an attempt to <UNK> <UNK> .

there is a very <UNK> way to accomplish this objective : make every individual ’s health expenses <#> % tax <UNK> .

"lets look at this topic , we have <#> types of cells to consider , <UNK> and adult stem cells ."
"in recent , stem cells have achieved both fame and <UNK> due to their potential and controversy ."
"when <UNK> stem cells are removed from their <UNK> life as an <UNK> , they can become virtually any cell in the body and potential <UNK> for many <UNK> ."
"if <UNK> into intact animals , they can become deadly <UNK> , complete with teeth and hair ."
"scientists believe these cells are the potential for ground - breaking <UNK> for diabetes , <UNK> ’s disease , heart failure and <UNK> ’s disease ."
"this promise alone <UNK> positive public opinion for research from individuals , commercial <UNK> , <UNK> and most recently nancy reagan ."
recent reports are <UNK> this issue as a pro <UNK> decision .
some people believe these cells should be left alone and others believe research is needed .
"together , we need to learn about this research and debate the issues at hand ."
"on <#> side , we have a moral dilemma , giving scientists license to make living human <UNK> ."
on another side we have a california voter <UNK> to issue a $ <#> <#> bond to support such research .
"some us states have <UNK> this approach entirely while the european community , parliament and the united nations have failed to agree on how to handle the issues ."
adult stem cells are quickly making <UNK> medicine a reality and potentially <UNK> major political debate .
"until recently , these cells were mostly ignored because they were thought to have limited <UNK> value ."
this position has recently changed in part because of the money issues surrounding <UNK> research .
all body organs contain small <UNK> of these <UNK> cells .
these cells show potential because they won’t be rejected and won’t cause <UNK> growth .
this progress is making it a preferred treatment for patient therapy .
"in addition , the cells drawn in the bone <UNK> have the ability to transform into almost any tissue in the body ."

hopefully i 'll come up with some other more interesting <UNK> for those of you who take the time to read me .
"i * am * a writer , published , so i should be able to at least make my boy - blogs somewhat entertaining to read ."
i liked the fact that people can comment on the blogs on this site .
i 'm vain enough to think a few folks might take a moment to share their thoughts on something i 've said .
"i 'd welcome that , if any of you are so inclined ."
"and i may move the entries from the <UNK> blog site over here , just to keep everything all in <#> place ."
i like things to be organized ( says she who has at least <#> different email addresses ) .

i worked at video <UNK> channel ( <UNK> ) from october of <UNK> of <#> .
"<#> hours a day , <#> days a week ."
johnny <UNK> ( a long time veteran of <UNK> radio ) was chief executive officer ( <UNK> ) and president of video <UNK> channel .
"video <UNK> channel effectively <UNK> all operations at the end of <#> , <UNK> filing for chapter <#> <UNK> , in the eastern division of u.s ."
i was employed there as a production assistant .
are some photos from that time period for your enjoyment .
.... yours truly ! <UNK> from the control room window .
"i was born robert eugene <UNK> at the university of tennessee hospital in <UNK> , tennessee on <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , and mary <UNK> ( anderson ) <UNK> ."
"though i do n't really recall , my sister jo - ann tells me that my dad was a <UNK> in his earlier years ."
he later would become <UNK> at first baptist church of fountain city .
"for as long as i can remember , my mother was a <UNK> ."
"cooking , cleaning and caring for and taking care of my dad and the rest of us , as any good wife and <UNK> would ."
"i later , while living on long hollow road , attended green hill elementary ( now <UNK> ridge elementary ) school on <UNK> valley road in powell , tennessee ."
the original school ( green hill ) was destroyed in a fire of unknown origin .
many of the flat - tops ( as they we 're called then ) burned very easily and quickly since they we 're constructed mostly of wooden materials .
later they would <UNK> <UNK> ridge elementary on the very site where the old school had previously stood .
it was here that i had my first childhood crush on a sandy blonde curly haired girl by the name of amy <UNK> .
<UNK> 's face was as red as a <UNK> county <UNK> . here at green hill we spent such long and <UNK> days .
"after elementary school came middle school , which for me was to be halls middle school ."
"here we begun to acquire , polish and <UNK> some of the skills and traits that we we 're to begin carrying into our adult lives ."
"to be honest , i had some troubles <UNK> to the many twists and turns on my <UNK> of my life here ."
"my grades were rotten , i rapidly became dis - interested in my school work ."
my self - esteem was practically non - <UNK> .
"the other students for the most part made fun of the way i looked , dressed and acted ."
"i had few friends , and never quite seemed to "" fit in "" , and i was very depressed ."
things came crashing down in a very hard way for me .
a special school where i would receive more <UNK> attention .
a <UNK> and <UNK> place that would <UNK> more readily to my special needs .
"so the necessary papers were signed , and i began attending young intervention on <UNK> highway in extreme south <UNK> ."
this was <UNK> the old young high school .
"from the moment i first arrived at young , i realized that this would be totally different than anything i had ever experienced before ."
"the building itself was <UNK> , and in some places , almost falling apart ."
my class consisted of approximately <#> - <#> people .
much smaller than what i had been accustomed to at halls .
"we had basically the same course of study , but on a smaller , and more <UNK> scale ."
some of the names that immediately come to mind are ...
"larry <UNK> , <UNK> cross , <UNK> & <UNK> <UNK> just to name a few ."
while at young there begun a rather <UNK> turning point in my life .
i found that the program really did work for me .
we also had a good time in the <UNK> playing volleyball .
"i actually became quite good at it , and enjoyed it thoroughly ."
it was also at young that i met my first real girlfriend .
"she was very sweet , and i was very much overwhelmed by her charm and beauty ."
"her smile could melt the <UNK> snow on a winter 's day , and to be near her was just sooooooo delightful ."
"young intervention proved so helpful , that i eventually brought all my grades up to straight a 's !"
after a time i was <UNK> to return to a regular school setting .
"a shame that the old building is gone , but certainly not forgotten , as it will continue to live on in my memories ."
"although young had proved very helpful to me , it could in no way prepare me for what i was about to get into next ..."
i found that when i returned to regular school i had a hard time <UNK> again .
perhaps i had gotten too used to life at young .
again i had problems and again i started down the path that i had traveled previously .
this time i decided to take what i thought was the easy way out and to just drop out .
by this time i had somehow gotten through the 10th grade .
so we all moved from long hollow into the house on sharp road .
at the time i too was living at home and with no job .
i was helping my parents out by running errands and doing pretty much what they needed me to do at the time .
"while living there , i acquired both a used <UNK> and a <UNK> <#> computer from a garage sale ."
this was to be my humble entry into the field of computers .
"i played around with it quite a bit , wrote a few programs in basic , and just <UNK> around mostly ."
it was also about this time that a service called q - link came to town .
i also quickly ran up a huge bill that to this day remains <UNK> .
i also discovered about that time the wonderful world of what was called <UNK> .
download music and software of all kinds and chat .
this was before the internet became really popular like it is today of course .
i had a <UNK> list of <UNK> that i called on a regular basis .
i even managed to somehow obtain a copy of color <#> and an extra telephone line and opened my pride and joy at the time ...
"operating on a <UNK> <#> computer , combined with both a <UNK> <#> and a <#> <UNK> disc drive ."
"it was a hobby , and fun for a while ."
"as luck would have it , david had already previously visited the banana factory and saw some of my <UNK> <UNK> that proudly announced ..."
"<UNK> needs a woman "" and things like that ."
so he was well aware of the fact that i was looking .
<#> day david was home and happen to notice that i had logged onto his board .
"he hit * * * chat mode * * * on his computer , and <UNK> to chat with me ."
he said he had someone he wanted me to meet .
"his sister dana , who was single and at the time did not have a boyfriend ."
so i chatted with dana for a while and we set up a time and a place to meet .
it was agreed we would meet at kay 's ice cream at black oak plaza in halls .
"we chatted for about <#> minutes or so , and we could see that we really did not have that much in common ."
"i was getting ready to leave , but she suggested i stick around as david was on his way there to see dana ."
"well , when david arrived in his gray <UNK> , he also had along dana 's sister <UNK> ."
at this point i 'll just say that the rest is history .
"we dated , we fell in love , i got a job , we got married ."
i spent many lonely nights just crying myself to sleep at night .
praying to god for the strength just to get through another day alone .
not long after me and <UNK> had decided to separate i tried the computer and finding several dating sites .
"after several months , <#> day i discovered <UNK> ."
there seemed to be several women in my area who was looking for someone .
then i read the profile of <UNK> and discovered sandra <UNK> .
"before long we had exchanged phone numbers , and was chatting on the phone well into the night ."
turns out that she knew <UNK> my pain and suffering because she had gone through it all herself .
"like me , someone had broken her heart , and ripped her world apart ."
she was no stranger to the tears and <UNK> .
our first encounter was to be at her parent 's home .
we went bowling at fountain lanes in fountain city .
she was just about the <UNK> <UNK> i have ever seen .
"in the weeks and months to come there would be more dates , and nights and weekends spent together ."
"finally we got tired of driving to each other 's house and said ah heck , let 's just get married !"
actually sandy got sick after eating at <UNK> house in <UNK> and i had to rush her to the hospital .
while she was there i stayed with her every second of the time and could n't bring myself to leave .
"it was then that we realized that we just could n't spend another night apart , so as they say ... the rest is history ."
we got <UNK> at her parent 's house in south clinton on <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> .
my thanks to jackie d for her help in sorting out my <UNK> settings <UNK> .
"any <UNK> among you should definitely visit urllink jackie 's blog , but possibly not if already hungry !"
... my date and time settings are all to cock .
but i 'll be <UNK> if i can fix it .
bear with me ( and let me know what i 'm doing wrong if <UNK> ! )
"yesterday , i managed to demonstrate all of these , sometimes <UNK> ."
and you can see the <UNK> evidence urllink here .
"thanks to the guys at the urllink big blog company for making it all possible - and with so much good grace , too ."
"these are early blogging days for me , so be patient !"
i 'll hopefully have this blog fully up and running early next week .
"let 's face it , i 'm cynical on <#> <UNK> : a ) do i have the discipline to post regularly ?"
"most people , by contrast , only know about it as a holiday resort for <UNK> 's wives ."
"it is , of course , also home to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> of my personal <UNK> ) and her partner sean ."
"i seek contacts for potential <UNK> , or , even better , <UNK> ."
i don’t know when to give a hug - or receive a hug .
"i know the basics of hugging , i think ."
"<UNK> at the apple store , depending on the price , hug to full on tongue kiss ."
too bad it ’s not always so clear .
have you ever gone to give a person a hug because you think your relationship is at that point and then they don’t return the hug ?
"or , you can also just make it weird for them for not ."
"you can hug them very tight , pat their head and whisper softly into their ear , “ everything ’s gonna be alright . ” cause it will ."
once you establish a hug relationship you are in it till the end .
"and you think your just hugging that person , but your not ."
you’re hugging everyone that that person is in a hug relationship with . pretty soon
"you’re up to <#> , <#> <#> hugs a day which even a teddy bear will tell you is crazy ."
everything is fine then <#> day you don’t give the hug or even worse you don’t receive the hug .
hey i noticed today you didn’t give me a hug .
you just gave me <#> of those head <UNK> .
” and a head nod isn’t bad at all but going from a hug to head nod is bad .
it just might be the worst things ever .
i blame hip - hop for the state that hugging is in .
"i love hip - hop music , but for all the good it ’s done in the world it ’s really <UNK> the waters for <UNK> ."
"” not as confusing as it sounds , but this is where it starts ."
"next , you have the , “ lean - in - touch - shoulders - half - hug - with - opposite - arm ."
"” that <#> can be added onto with the , “"
"pull - away - hand - shake - thingy , ” but"
now you’re into <UNK> and that ’s a whole other demon .
"” they respond , “ sorry can’t do it ."
"” they state , “ it ’s a secret ."
"” then you get them with , “ i’ll show you mine if you show me yours , ” and you’re in ."
those <#> over there are doing a secret <UNK> .
"no , not those <#> , their arm wrestling ."
the <#> in back of them with the funny big red hats and golden <UNK> .
” and that ’s the thing about secret <UNK> i find so confusing .
"as secret as they are , they are anything but subtle ."
i offer if you want to keep your <UNK> a secret keep the high <UNK> to a minimum .
do you think that maybe what we recognize as a regular <UNK> today was once the most brilliant secret <UNK> ever ?
"then it got back to the original creator and they were like , “"
"” they answer , in a british accent , “ from the captain of the <UNK> i traveled to your country in ."
i love this <#> because as important as arms are to a hug the back is right there too .
"without the back there is no where for the arms and hands to go and make that pat motion , which essentially <UNK> the hug ."
the <#> people over hug cause they can’t feel it .
they just end up <UNK> each other ’s possessions .
"“ wow you got a lot of stuff , that you can’t be away from ."
"well ok , i’m gonna go take some <UNK> for my back ."
” if you think hugs are on their way out you’re crazy .
"<UNK> , secret or not will be gone way before the hug ever leaves us ."
my proof is that you can’t shake your own hand and not feel goofy .
a major flaw with the invention of the <UNK> .
you can try but the other hand just can’t grip .
"just a quick note on the rest of the people in my project promise <#> <UNK> , in no particular ."
i will try not to leave anyone out .
very intelligent and tries very hard to be our mother .

"i am a full time student without a paying job , i need cheap clothes !"
"i got <#> nice pairs of <UNK> for about <#> each , as well as <#> polo shirts and <#> short sleeve casual shirts ."
"i am paul <UNK> , a guy who wants to be a teacher ."
"i have wanted to be a teacher for a long time , but got <UNK> early in life and went into another career ."
"now , some <#> years later , i have decided that teaching is what i must do ."
"to further this goal , i applied for and was accepted into project promise , a program specifically designed for <UNK> professionals who wish to become teachers ."
"the program is based at colorado state university in fort <UNK> , co. our program , project promise <#> , began on august <#> , <#> ."
"in the first couple of weeks , we have developed a "" <UNK> , "" a <UNK> and supportive group that is in it for the long haul ."
there are <#> students in the program and <#> <UNK> .
"we are now about to begin the first "" teaching "" phase of our program ."
"we are all about to enter our <UNK> , beginning on august 16th ."
project promise starts its students out as <UNK> in local middle or junior high schools .
"i have been placed in <UNK> la <UNK> junior high school in <UNK> , co"
and i start in a day and a half .
almost everyone showed up at <UNK> 's house on friday evening for a get - together to talk about our week .
"robert , ali , terry and <UNK> did n't come , and of course , lee is fishing in alaska ."
it was * great * to see everyone !
"i tried to connect with almost everyone to talk about our experiences , or lack thereof ."
i truly wish that they were having the experiences that i am having .
i think that all of them are feeling very unwanted at this point .
i am thinking positive thoughts for all of the <#> of them .
i hope that they get a <UNK> soon !
it was great hearing the stories from the others that have been in schools this week .
"the people in <UNK> schools and jeff at <UNK> school have not had any kids yet , but the rest of us have been in classes since wednesday ."
i really like sara 's story about getting an apple from a student after she helped the little girl open her locker on the first day .
it sounds like tim is picking up some nice teaching skills in his <UNK> class .
"after listening to everyone 's stories , i realize how incredibly lucky i am to be at <UNK> ."
the school and its staff have bent over backward to make me ( and jay ) feel welcome .
"<UNK> , my <UNK> teacher , is glad to have me there and is anxious for me to help him in his classes in any way that i can ."
"he is also very willing to let me try new things , conduct new projects and take over the class whenever it is needed ."
"so far , my experience has been wonderful and i am truly grateful to be at a school where i feel that i belong ."
i have learned a few things in my first week .
"well , my adventures at <UNK> are done for the day ."
"i paid my summer tuition bill , as well as my graduate school application fee , which i had somehow forgotten long ago ."
i also submitted all of the rest of the papers that needed to be turned in to <UNK> .
"if this happens on monday , i can still get my online registration done for most of my classes ."
"i will still have to go through the <UNK> process , but that should be easy ."
"i also talked with teresa <UNK> about our business methods class , starting next tuesday at <UNK> ."
it is in room <#> of the education building .
i told her about my registration issues and she said not to worry .
"i also ran into <UNK> at the education building , but none of the other <UNK> staff were around ."
i am going to try to get to the <UNK> this evening at <UNK> 's house .
"<UNK> and i were teaching some basic graphics using the "" fireworks "" program in our second period class this morning ."
"we were having the class experiment with different effects on their <UNK> , drawing weird and interesting colors and shapes ."
"<#> girls in the class had the program open , but were talking , instead of working ."
"<UNK> , i am going to write you a message !"
she reaches for the mouse again as i start to sweat .
"she quickly <UNK> off her message by writing "" ... <UNK> . """
i stick my tongue out at her and walk away .
i am taking into account the fact that girls her age are naturally mean and am trying not to take it personally .
"my response was undoubtedly not the best , but i could n't think of anything else to say !"
"after much <UNK> , i found out my problem ."
i am not admitted into the graduate school yet .
this is putting a hold on my registration .
i talked with <UNK> <UNK> and there are still <#> pieces of paper that i am missing from my folder .
i have them and will be taking them to her this afternoon .
"i am hoping that with some luck and alot of running around , i can get the admission approved this afternoon and complete registration ."
"she is out to lunch at the moment , but i will check in with her afterwards ."
"i will need to get her approval , the approval of donna ( ? ) the head of the ed ."
"school , then get the information to <UNK> , so that they can release my hold , allowing me to register at the <UNK> 's office ."
think i can get all of that done today ?
"if i can at least get the <UNK> stuff completed today , i think that i will be alright , because i can do late registration if absolutely necessary ."
everyone is getting together this evening at <UNK> 's house for a check - in with our <UNK> .
almost everyone that sees me eat lunch at school asks about it .
"to date , i have received <#> marriage proposal , numerous orders and an offer to become someone 's chef for life ."
preparing the dish usually requires about <#> hour .
i did not have time to get my whole salad eaten today and had to bring some of it home .
"in case anyone is wondering , i have almost the exact same thing for breakfast each morning , leaving out the meat and vegetables ."
"it is thursday , august <#> , <#> ."
the first day of the block schedule here at <UNK> la <UNK> junior high school .
"<UNK> and i have classes for period <#> , <#> and <#> , each lasting about <#> minutes ."
"7th period , also known as right now , is a planning period , so i am blogging in the media center ."
"today , we worked on getting each student logged into their computers , change their <UNK> , open their student <UNK> and save a file to their <UNK> ."
"of course , with the start of school and the installation of a new server , we were bound to have some problems ."
"some kids seemed to be able to log right in and change their password , others could n't ."
"at first , we thought that students had to log in under the <UNK> server , as this is the way things were last year ."
"this year , they have to log in under the "" students "" server ."
still some computers worked well and others did n't .
"having students change computers seemed to help on <UNK> , sometimes not ."
<UNK> ) came down from the server room to help .
he is the new tech guy and was a student here at <UNK> <#> years ago .
"student <UNK> seemed to be opening in random places , sometimes in the student <UNK> , sometimes in the "" year of graduation "" <UNK> ."
this turned out to be a <UNK> problem and should be fixed soon .
"in some of the more basic classes , mr ."
"<UNK> and i began by going over some basic computer <UNK> , such as "" network , "" "" lan , "" "" internet "" and so forth ."
"for the web publishing class , we began by having the kids start a webpage using only html script ."
"this was actually kind of fun and the kids all seems to get excited about the smallest things , such as changing the background color of their webpage ."
they put in a link and a picture from the internet .
our computer skills ii class began working on their <UNK> hunt .
"<UNK> put this together and the project has students searching for the answers to questions on the internet , such as "" who is the president of mexico ?"
""" they had to include the answer as well as a posting of the web link on their answer sheet ."
a couple of kids got the entire set of questions completed within the <#> minutes we had left in the period .
alot of kids got stuck and only managed to answer <#> or <#> questions .
we will be completing this <UNK> hunt about <#> more times . just to stay involved and understand what went into the creation of the project
", i just completed my own <UNK> hunt ."
it is saved to my resource file on the server and i will have kids work on this tomorrow and monday .
<UNK> and i seem to be working together pretty well .
"i think he likes having me in class to help answer questions for kids on <#> side of the room , while he works the other ."
<UNK> has been taking time from most classes to try to help me learn the names of our kids .
"i have been doing the "" name circle , "" having each student list their name and the names of each of the students in line behind them ."
"i then have them change all of their positions while i am out of the room , to see if i can get their names right ."
i tend to fail miserably and everyone laughs .
"i am <UNK> about <#> or so , but i am at least getting a couple of names down ."
"while sitting here working on my blog , i was introduced to our new <UNK> , nancy wright , as she <UNK> our building ."
she seems like a very nice and enthusiastic person .
"in this study hall , students are supposed to be working on homework , class projects , etc ."
"no sleeping , no music , no <UNK> off ."
i think that we have a stack of papers to hand out to the kids today .
i may log in for another word or <#> later .
it is now the end of the 8th period of the first day .
"we did the straight schedule today , with each class coming in for <#> or so minutes ."
"tomorrow , we start the <UNK> block , with the odd - <UNK> period classes coming in for <#> minute blocks ."
"we will actually start doing <UNK> tomorrow , such as <UNK> login accounts , emails , etc ."
<UNK> had me conduct the class for 8th period .
it was a 7th grade computer skills class .
"i went over all of the lab rules , etc . and was talking about the agenda for the semester while mr ."
"unfortunately , all of the stuff that i covered was wrong ."
"the agenda for the class does not include typing skills , even though i said it did and does not include <UNK> , even though i said it did ."
"i think i confused the poor kids , because mr ."
"<UNK> then came in and said , "" hey , we do n't do any of that stuff ! """
"i looked kind of dumb , but it went pretty well , for the most part ."
"seventh graders , especially in the last period of the day , are kind of <UNK> and confused , anyway ."
"as there is n't much planning to do on the first day , i decided to find an open computer in the media center and put up a blog ."
"this was our first day and it has been hectic , but fun ."
the first day for the most part has consisted of mr .
"in each class , he spends some time going over the "" agenda "" for the class for the quarter or for the semester ."
"we are not doing any computer <UNK> , password changes , etc ."
"<UNK> knows many of the students already , either from classes last year or from football or other sports ."
he does not spend much time at all going over names .
"this will make it hard for me to learn student 's names , but i will do my best ."
<UNK> will be letting me teach alot of his courses when the time comes .
"he had me do most of the classroom procedures for the 6th period class , as i already had heard it <#> times ."
we had a planning period during 4th period .
<UNK> went to lift ( attend to <UNK> duties . )
i checked out of the building with <UNK> at the front desk and took a tour of the grounds .
"there is a nice nature path by the river in the back of the school grounds , as well as a frisbee golf course ."
"i am an old time frisbee <UNK> , so i will have to try out the course someday ."
"<UNK> and jay , as well as a host of other teachers in the teacher 's lounge ."
lots of talk and laughs about swimming dogs and the new <UNK> <UNK> in the lunch room ( which <UNK> a cow <UNK> . )
<UNK> about the case study and needing to find a student .
"there is a wheel - chair bound student with ms that i was immediately drawn to , but i do n't think he will work out ."
"he was scheduled to be in our class first period , but his bus does n't arrive early enough and we wo n't have him at all this semester ."
"i might try to work something out to shadow him anyway , as he seems like a great kid and it would be neat to work with him ."
"my first day in a real school classroom as a "" teacher , "" something i have been dreaming about for <#> years or so ."
"bell will be going off for 8th period soon , so i must log off ."
hope everyone has had as good a day as i have !
it is the end of the day and i am getting ready to head home .
i helped guy put all of the <UNK> back on their respective shelves and sort out <UNK> and connections .
"as guy does all of his work with students by way of the computer , there are no copies to be made , etc ."
"tomorrow , we will mostly be learning names and covering some of the rules of the classroom ."
i do n't think anyone will even touch a computer .
"i am to report at 7:30 a.m. be prepared for locker problems , says everyone ."
our hallway has 7th grade <UNK> and word on the street is that * nobody * will be able to open their locker .
"apparently , you need to spin , spin , stop , left , spin , right , spin , twist and pull ."
"i think that the "" twist and pull "" gets them ."
this in many ways applies to the situation that many of us are facing .
"we are done talking and practicing , we are now in classes with real kids ."
"however , i suppose that in the post - <UNK> world , any reference to bullets in a classroom is probably <UNK> ."
just posting a little update regarding the day .
we had a staff meeting this morning to review the procedures for the start of school with respect to the death of mr .
i then met with guy and <#> teachers that will be teaching computer classes this year .
i had an idea about my goal for the classes and my participation this session .
i ran it by guy and he is all for it .
"the north fork lab , our classroom , has a couple of faded <UNK> boards and some ancient apple "" think different "" posters on the walls ."
we do n't even have apple computers anymore .
i would like to use our computer graphics class to have kids create some computer artwork to start a gallery in the lab .
", i think it would be great thing for the lab , as well ."
"i will work this into the classes later in the year , if possible ."
"talked with randy , a math teacher , about guy ."
he told me the story about how guy met his wife ( randy set them up . )
"he says that guy is a great teacher , sometimes <UNK> , but that he gets great results from his kids ."
"guy does not seem to have any written lesson plans or <UNK> , he just knows what he is going to teach and he teaches it ."
alot of the progress in his classes appears to be the students <UNK> out on their own and learning how to do things .
this will be a neat process to watch .
"at the moment , guy is off taking care of some "" <UNK> "" stuff , so i am set free for awhile ."
i may try to find jay and see about lunch .
"i think that he is <UNK> social studies procedures with megan , a <UNK> graduate , for the day ."
"i will be back here at 1:00 , when we have to get the classroom ready for tomorrow ."
"this mostly will involve moving the <UNK> for each <UNK> into place , cleaning up , etc . time for lunch ."
i am in a little early this morning to <UNK> down some thoughts about yesterday .
"guy wanted me to come in at 8:30 a.m. , but i am in at 8:00 ."
"i tried to remember everyone 's name in the office , but was <UNK> ."
"i think that i will remember <UNK> , the office manager , next time , though ."
"just in case anyone was wondering , when i got home yesterday at <UNK> , i slept straight through until 6:00 p.m. i was exhausted ."
<#> thing that really struck me about the meetings and <UNK> yesterday was the extent to which student privacy is an issue .
"in guy 's class , the websites that students create for projects can not be posted onto the internet , only on the <UNK> web ."
i have even heard that a teacher is not allowed to have any pictures taken with their students that show the identity of the students .
"this is an unfortunate consequence of the way the world is nowadays , i suppose ."
"well , it is later in the evening on my first day in a school ."
i have already written about the death of <#> of most popular teachers at <UNK> this morning .
"jay and i both received the short trip to our rooms , guided by the new <UNK> principal , brian williams , who was very <UNK> and welcoming ."
"i met cheryl and eric , jay 's co - op teachers , as well as megan , a project promise <#> graduate ."
"i was made to feel very welcome , which i appreciated ."
"at <UNK> a.m. , brian brought out the breakfast <UNK> and fruit and juice for all ."
brian then started the video of the new <UNK> .
we listened to that ( sort of . )
we then had an <UNK> staff meeting and began to cover some agenda and theme issues for the coming year .
"we discussed the new study hall , implemented each day for <#> hour at the end of the school day . also talked about <UNK> , grades and attendance ."
<UNK> of implementation of policy was a common theme .
"we <UNK> the "" <#> traits , "" ongoing writing goals to be addressed in each class ."
"these appear to be behavior management techniques , but i am not too sure about these yet ."
we wrapped up talking about some <UNK> issues .
"guy arrived at 8:30 a.m. , to the <UNK> of other teachers ."
"he is , apparently , well - liked and is used to taking and giving out grief ."
"guy is a computer teacher , but used to be a social studies and history teacher ."
he was giving a little <UNK> to the me and the other new teachers about the program when we received the announcement regarding mr .
that shocked and stunned everyone and the staff quickly lost their focus and determination to get on with the school year .
guy sent me off to have lunch while he collected his feelings and thoughts .
i ate lunch in cheryl 's room with cheryl and jay .
it was great having someone welcome us in during such an <UNK> time .
"after lunch , i met again with guy in the north fork computer lab , our classroom ."
we went over his class schedule and some of the courses that we will be teaching .
i got to see some of the work from last year 's students and the <UNK> were excellent !
"<UNK> <UNK> with music , animation , video , etc ."
<UNK> is <#> of the <UNK> schools in <UNK> school district with respect to technology .
"they were , in fact , the pilot school for the implementation of the <UNK> program , now used in all schools ."
guy has a great approach to his subject and seems to <UNK> on encouraging students to try and to experiment and to learn on their own .
"he provides the tools and some instruction , the kids take it from there ."
i think that it will be a * very * exciting experience for me .
guy also appears very willing to let me teach or participate however i wish .
"i am sure he would let me start teaching right away , if i wanted ."
"<#> other thing about guy is that he is the football , track and wrestling coach ."
"he has alot of respect from the students , particularly athletes ."
add that the fact that he teaches <UNK> classes and i do not <UNK> classroom management as being much of a problem .
we wrapped up the day by setting me up on the computer with a staff login and password .
"guy was off to conduct football practice at 2:00 p.m. i offered to help in any way that i could , but he declined ."
"i do n't think he wants a "" student coach . """
we start again tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. i hope that the <UNK> <UNK> members without student teaching assignments got some today .
and i hope that everyone is getting a chance to be a part of this like i am .
i am taking a quick lunch break at <UNK> and found a computer with an internet <UNK> .
"this morning , we had a staff meeting , where everyone introduced themselves ."
about <#> of the teachers here this year are new .
jay and i introduced ourselves along with the rest of the teachers .
"i was pleased that numerous teachers , <UNK> , etc ."
came up to introduce themselves throughout the morning .
"i will go into a little more coverage of the morning meeting later , but must first discuss what happened shortly after the meeting ."
the mood in the school went from <#> of excitement and anticipation to <#> of shock and dismay instantly . as it turns out
", i may have seen the accident on my way to the <UNK> in the morning ."
i had no idea at the time what was <UNK> . being from outside of the school
", i feel a little out of place , but i can feel and understand the emotion and the feelings ."
it is about 4:30 a.m. i am awake .
"my <UNK> have kicked in , as they so often do in august ."
i am <UNK> like crazy and can not breathe .
i thought i would come down to the computer and put up some thoughts .
my <UNK> have <UNK> me since i was very young .
i remember going out and sleeping on the garage roof at my parents ' house when i was a boy .
"now , i do not have a garage roof ."
"<UNK> have been particularly tough on me in the month of august , so i always dread this month ."
"<UNK> , most of my worst work is completed in the month of august , such as relationship <UNK> , lost jobs , etc ."
"this made me a little nuts and i began to have what they call "" <UNK> thoughts , "" a sign of depression ."
"i was convinced that my marriage was breaking up , that everyone was laughing at me all the time and that generally , life would be better <UNK> ."
i remember watching an <UNK> <UNK> late night on tv during that time .
"it was the episode in which jimmy <UNK> lay dying on his bed in the hospital , with his wife by his side , struggling to draw breath ."
"my thought at the time was , "" he is so lucky , all he has to do is try to breathe ! """
"obviously , this was not clear - headed thinking ."
"robert lawrence in fort <UNK> helped me to identify what my problem was , not enough quality sleep ."
he <UNK> some <UNK> that truly helped me get back my sleep and myself .
"because of the good doctor 's <UNK> , i no longer am health <UNK> , so i can no longer take the medicine ."
"i <UNK> with some over - the - counter <UNK> , but it is not as useful ."
"i am going to start my day , a little earlier than i thought ."
it is the night before our first day in a classroom .
"tomorrow , we will be meeting with our <UNK> teachers in their schools to attend meetings with them and begin helping them set up their <UNK> ."
i am excited and a little bit nervous .
"i will be getting to bed at around 10:00 p.m. , hoping to get up at 6:00 a.m. to get ready ."
i already have my clothes picked out and everything .
the things that i meant did not come out as well as i wanted them to and i am sorry .
i have had a couple people write regarding blogs and how you get started with <#> .
urllink <UNK> there are no fees or anything for this blogger .
"just click on a "" create a blog "" link and get started ."
"if anyone has any questions , let me know ."
"if a couple of us or more start blogs regarding <UNK> , we could try to webpage them for easy <UNK> ."
"this will allow you to critique my writing style , or whatever ."
"as i mentioned awhile back , i have wanted to be a teacher since my junior year in high school , when the late ( and great ) mr ."
he had <UNK> and a passion for teaching and made history seem relevant .
"unfortunately , he passed away suddenly when i was a senior ."
his funeral was the first that i ever attended .
"when i am finally standing in front of my very own classroom , i will think of him ."
i left <UNK> high school in ohio to attend the university of denver to study history .
"i did not fit in very well , as much of du was made up of theater arts <UNK> and hotel management people ."
"somewhere along the line , i read some books by edward <UNK> , the "" monkey <UNK> gang , "" and "" the journey home . """
this convinced me that i needed to be a <UNK> <UNK> .
"i was wrong , of course , as i am not really an outdoor person ."
"however , i left du and went to colorado state university the next year , to study animals and birds ."
"soon , i was <UNK> in my classes and losing my way ."
"meeting some people in a bar <#> night throwing <UNK> , i happened to mention that i was needing work ."
"<#> very nice lady , <UNK> , said , "" i run a group home for the <UNK> disabled ."
"i need a morning staff person , why do n't you come by ? "" this was early may , <#> ."
"i worked with the <UNK> disabled from may <#> , <#> until may <#> , <#> ."
"not the career that i wanted , but a career ."
"i eventually started my own business serving the <UNK> disabled in <UNK> county , colorado ."
"i had a staff of up to <#> people , serving as many as <#> clients ."
"i <UNK> myself on hiring the best for the job , no matter the circumstances . of my employees"
", i had <#> people with advanced degrees , <#> employees with <UNK> and <#> that was in her <#> 's . working with that population"
i eventually had to give up the business when we moved from the area .
"this may have been a bad decision , but it has led me to where i am today ."
"along the way , i went to the university of phoenix to get a master 's degree of business administration in technology management ."
this had helped me run my business and give me a deep appreciation of all things <UNK> .
"i then tried a number of other things , such as being an investment counselor , a sales manager and so forth ."
i had a talk ( similar to jay 's talk with his wife . )
we decided that i should be a teacher .
"she pushed me to look into the prospect , although i thought it was impossible ."
i applied to <#> - <#> school <UNK> in the spring of <#> .
i heard nothing from anyone and was very discouraged .
"i said , "" yeah , whatever . """
"( remember , i was <UNK> at this point . ) she looked into it for me ."
i was pretty sure that i would hear nothing more .
ali called me <#> days later to set up an interview .
"the interview was <UNK> , as i thought that it went well and that i might be accepted to the program ."
you are pretty much <UNK> to school and teaching for a full <#> months and can not work .
this was going to be hard on our family .
"fortunately , shannon 's boss has agreed to allow her to work <UNK> - time hours so that she can stay at home during the day ."
my parents have also agreed to assist with some of the financial <UNK> and provide a small - interest loan to pay tuition .
"without their help , this would not have been possible ."
<UNK> 's computer i classes are all <#> quarter long .
<UNK> has already <UNK> that i will be teaching these classes from the very beginning .
"this will be a unique opportunity , as i will be in charge of <#> whole classes from start to finish ."
i am starting to think of how i would like to conduct these classes .
i would like to try to put together abit more of an introduction than mr .
", i would like to be able to put together a <UNK> presentation for the first day or so that would cover all of these issues in order ."
"it is monday , the start of the first full week with students ."
"monday is our "" every period "" class , where we see each class for about <#> minutes or so ."
not really enough time to get a lot done .
"today , we are making sure that everyone is logged in properly and mr ."
<UNK> is setting up email accounts for the students .
"for the computer i classes , monday is "" typing "" day ."
they work on the typing tutor program the whole class period .
they have to complete at least <#> of the typing lessons by the end of the quarter .
"she kept trying and trying , but coming up with scores of <#> or <#> ."
"i kept checking in with her , hoping to keep her going ."
"finally , she got to <#> and was really pleased with herself ."
she looked around to find me and show me her score .
"kind of neat , in a "" very small moment "" sort of way ."
the next <#> classes were working on fireworks graphics and html coding for basic website design .
<UNK> likes to give short little mini - lessons on how to do things in fireworks .
"he will bring up a canvas , put in a figure , demonstrate a couple of effects and then have the student do the same on their computer ."
"<UNK> 's computer has a different program version ( build ) from the students , so his <UNK> are completely different from everyone else 's ."
there tends to be a great deal of <UNK> of abilities in our graphics and our web design classes .
some kids are pretty computer <UNK> and whip through mr .
<UNK> 's activities in a couple of minutes .
"then , they like to try new things and experiment , which is ok , as that is generally the best way to learn computer programs ."
"there are some students , however , that struggle to keep up and have a hard time "" making the leap "" from mr ."
it appears to be difficult to <UNK> all <UNK> of learning within a single classroom without holding the faster kids back and without losing the struggling kids .
i am helping out the slower group as best i can .
"<UNK> , as i stated before , likes to do a lot of "" flying by the seat of the pants "" instruction ."
this is a little less <UNK> than i would like to do things .
they might cry if they do n't get their <UNK> open .
try to learn how to accomplish this simple task very early on so that you can prevent the tears .
<UNK> boys that are popular really do punch each other alot .
"try to say "" hi "" and introduce yourself to anyone you do n't know , especially in the teacher 's lounge ."
sometimes junior high school girls say things that are n't very nice .
"there are likely to be a couple of <UNK> in your class , such as new kids , overweight kids , <UNK> kids , etc ."
"make an effort to notice them and be nice to them , but do n't let anyone see you doing it ."
"if you have to leave the building , let the office manager know ."
your <UNK> teacher is likely to be different from you .
"if they need something , get it for them ."
"if the phone rings during class , answer it for them ."
"if they need help with the students , help them ."
<#> ill - <UNK> fart can permanently affect your status as an effective teacher in the eyes of your students .
"take steps to prevent this sort of thing , if necessary ."
"alot of times , questions that you ask the class are going to go <UNK> ."
the kid wearing the black <UNK> does n't care if you exist .
take this as a personal challenge to get to know them better .
"if you get to school early enough , you will be able to find a good parking spot ."
be prepared with a good generic <UNK> to any rude comment that might be directed at you .
sticking your tongue out at the <UNK> student is not likely to be the most appropriate response .
that is all i can remember at the moment .
urllink wool urllink it was a quiet weekend here in the hollow .
i spent a lot of time cleaning up around the farm .
"lots of things i no longer need or are broken beyond repair that need to be given away , <UNK> , or thrown out ."
"also much time spent on the phone finding out more about camp wood , tx !"
"it 's sounding better , and better ... i need to do something with my huge amount of raw wool ."
"i do n't want to spin it all , but may try my hand at <UNK> for a fun change ."
"there is a woman who <UNK> the coffee house in the village , and makes <UNK> wool bags ."
"she <UNK> large pieces of natural colors or naturally dyed wool together , and then <UNK> them into bags ."
"so i have been dreaming of doing this for another winter <UNK> , and also <UNK> my winter library for those long <UNK> nights by the <UNK> and fire ."
"mainly titles i 've chosen are women 's wilderness stories , <UNK> , and finish off some of my <UNK> <UNK> ."
urllink my <UNK> urllink what a busy day !
"oh it was lovely though , and i got loads done ."
i 'm a <UNK> ( <UNK> ) and eat no animal products .
the last thing i gave up was <UNK> ( ouch ! )
"it was very difficult as i love my coffee , but now i have it on holidays as a treat and i feel and sleep much better ."
"so i was out of <UNK> , and a few other items , hence my hike to the store ."
"i love to look at all the girl stuff like natural <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"i like to smell things , like the <UNK> , massage <UNK> , ya know ... girl stuff ."
"anyhoo , they have a yummy book section which i flew over to like a <UNK> ! and"
in the cart it went with my other <UNK> like thai kitchen 's <UNK> salad splash and <UNK> 's bees <UNK> mint tooth paste .
i mix it with a little tom 's of maine 's <UNK> since the <UNK> mint is n't <UNK> and i brush away !
"wes , my son was at a friend 's house , so i bought him some goodies too ."
"traffic was fine getting back , and here i am ."
i need to go wash some <UNK> and vegetables for dinner .
urllink <UNK> urllink not much to share today .
it 's good to take a photo quick ! before it gets messy again .
"i have a ton to do today , but mostly errands to the <UNK> , post office , natural food store which is a ways away ."
"it 's a beautiful day , and the windows are all open so the sounds of farm creatures and wild birds come in on the breeze ."
maybe i 'll get enough done to play on the lake tomorrow in <#> gorgeous red <UNK> !
urllink <UNK> urllink the <UNK> is so nice to work in since i cleaned it up that i 've spent all morning out there preparing <UNK> for fall <UNK> .
this has been an excellent year with all the rain .
the only thing i wish i had planted earlier are berry bushes .
"i think i 'll order some <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> after i figure out where i want them ."
i 'll add a little as time goes on if i stay here .
i 'm still up in the air about texas .
"i 'm very tempted , but it 's hard after you 've worked so hard in <#> place to have to start <UNK> ."
"my <UNK> cherry tomatoes are a excellent this year , especially the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"lots of <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> , so it ’s time to scout for <UNK> and spray ."
i 'll plant more <UNK> there next to the <UNK> in the spring .
"i 'll try some garlic spray first and if it 's <UNK> , i 'll use bt ."
i put up <#> <UNK> of tomato sauce and <UNK> tomatoes yesterday .
<UNK> it did n't take long with my son <UNK> it feels good to look at stored food .
it must be my <UNK> in <UNK> as that secure feeling of looking at a well <UNK> <UNK> is priceless !
urllink texas urllink it 's so funny
"i just mentioned my grandmother , and have been thinking of texas all week ."
"a friend of mine emailed from camp wood , tx , from a <#> <UNK> ranch that "" i would just love "" and offered me employment ."
"i admit , i 've been on <UNK> looking at land all week all over texas ."
i could always tear it down and <UNK> later .
it 's a nice thought to be able to live on your property while building .
"i 'm thinking in that heat , straw <UNK> would be good combined with <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"so i 'll see what that offer is about , and think it over ."
i <UNK> my texas <UNK> monthly and watch texas country reporter on friend 's <UNK> who have satellite every so often .
"i was just about to order my texas <UNK> calendar too from urllink <UNK> , and here is this offer from the universe to go home ."
"my <UNK> friend <UNK> ( not her real name ) , and i went <UNK> around to hunt for left over <UNK> , and we found a few !"
we <UNK> all over the edge of a local <#> acres lake .
"the <UNK> we found were so sweet , and we <UNK> around in the shallow shore areas discussing books , men , life , and spiritual things ."
"thought we saw a bear , but i think it was deer ."
"too bad , i love to bear watch ."
"urllink <UNK> urllink i just finished "" the legacy of <UNK> "" by julia <UNK> hill and it was great !"
"move over <UNK> <UNK> , and make a little room for julia !"
"this is a woman who spent <#> years living on a <UNK> ' platform in a california <UNK> named "" <UNK> "" to save her from <UNK> ."
"hail to you julia butterfly for your courage , <UNK> , and <UNK> to accept things as they are ."
"the dvd "" butterfly "" , a documentary on julia 's tree sit is available for rent from <UNK> urllink <UNK> and it was wonderful ."
staying in a <UNK> <#> ' off the ground is n't as romantic as it sounds .
other times it was <UNK> with high winds and her platform being tossed <#> ' in the air
"while suffering <UNK> , and being cold like i ca n't imagine ."
hope and the proof that anything is possible if we put our minds to it .
"julia kicked some serious <UNK> company ass , and i love her for it ."
i hope it 's just a passing thing ... <UNK> ... excuse the pun .
"it 's still raining this morning , but the garden is loving it ."
i 've been so spoiled with this cool summer .
it makes it a lot easier to work outside without the <UNK> sun and humidity ...
"this summer has been a dream though , and i 've gotten so much done ."
"i got a wild hair last night , and cleaned up the main green house ."
"<UNK> grows like crazy in there , and i do n't mind except the floor can get very slippery ."
i have <#> other <UNK> <UNK> on frames that i <UNK> each season .
this works beautifully for us and we have fresh <UNK> and vegetables all <#> seasons .
the main green house is off of my kitchen .
i have <#> solar <UNK> to heat with and they work beautifully so far .
"we installed them before last winter ( autumn <#> ) , and they worked beautifully last winter , even the house felt warmer ."
"i got my <UNK> used , and added a fan from crystal bay"
urllink <UNK> and i 'm amazed at how well these <#> <UNK> heat so <UNK> .
now my african grey and lady <UNK> can stay out in the <UNK> longer and they love it .
"today i 'll be <UNK> more <UNK> , tomatoes , and maybe make more <UNK> ."
urllink grandma urllink i was missing my grandma today .
i was raised by my grandparents in a tiny town in texas .
how odd not to be able to even recognize areas when i go back home .
i have so many fond memories of growing up there .
"my grandmother , who passed on new years day <#> , was a huge influence in my life ."
"she was big into <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> before it became "" in "" ."
i miss her more than words can say .
"my <UNK> was raised in <UNK> , on a small farm ."
"her father was a kind man , and i remember him ."
he lived with us for a short time when i was very small .
he had a kind heart and was a very genuine person .
i had no children to play with on the texas <UNK>
"so i played with <UNK> and the horses , dogs , and cats we had on the farm ."
it was a rich time in my life and a beautiful way to spend childhood .
"a large <UNK> sat on the front porch <UNK> , and looked like she was related to <UNK> the hut ."
<UNK> spent many a summer on the porch and got fairly <UNK> .
"my love of <UNK> still exists today , and i think i 've passed it on to me son ."
"i come in the little things , <UNK> the lord : yea ! on the <UNK> wings of eager birds"
", the softly <UNK> feet of <UNK> and gentle <UNK> , i come to meet your hard and <UNK> heart ."
"in brown bright eyes that <UNK> from out the brake , i stand <UNK> ."
on every nest where <UNK> patience is content to <UNK> and leaves her pleasure for the high <UNK> of <UNK> there <UNK> my <UNK> rest .
"urllink <UNK> dreams urllink i forgot to mention that as i was <UNK> , i would , on <UNK> , look over <UNK> at my <UNK> ."
it looked oh - so - lonely there parked on the side of the yard .
"i have <#> friends that i usually <UNK> with , but the rain has been constant this last week , and there is so much to do around here ."
"speaking of <UNK> things , have a look at <UNK> <UNK> dance if you like nature , <UNK> , and poetry ."
"tuesday , rain or shine , i 'm <UNK> around the lake to pick <UNK> if there are any left ."
urllink <UNK> urllink ahhh ... what a day to start a blog .
it 's a good thing to be on the side of a mountain as we are n't flooded .
"the weeds have all gone crazy though , and i spent most of the day <UNK> the raised beds and my <UNK> garden ."
i listened to <UNK> and the classical was nice while <UNK> .
"i love the <UNK> , and am getting ready for more with thoughts of fall ."
"the <UNK> colors , apple <UNK> , <UNK> animals ."
"a native <UNK> , i have a <#> <UNK> organic farm in <UNK> ."
we have a quiet life here in this mountain hollow .
"it 's just my son and i here , and i 'm amazed some days at how far we 've come ."
"for a year i lived in an urban <UNK> after marrying an abusive man , who had been wonderful to me for <#> years before ."
"after i signed that license and took my <UNK> , that would all change to an embarrassing horror ."
"it 's since been <#> years since all that occured , and here we are ."
i <UNK> most of the day on these incredible breakfast cookies .
i 'm a <UNK> person ( or <UNK> to some ) .
that means i do n't eat meat or dairy .
"i do use honey though , and i am not much of an <UNK> ."
i tend not to judge others and feel i 'm responsible for only myself .
"so i hope to set an example by action , not promotion ."
<UNK> 's breakfast cookies <UNK> the oven to <#> degrees f. step <#> - beat together until well mixed : <#> t. <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> egg <UNK> step <#> - add the following and mix well : <#> and <#> c. <UNK> <#> <UNK> .
"cinnamon <#> c. smooth , thick <UNK> <UNK> <#> <UNK> of <UNK> syrup <#> <UNK> ."
"i use <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> . )"
"i then use a big spoon to "" drop "" them onto a lightly <UNK> cookie sheet in the shape of cookies ."
"they do not stick together like regular cookies , but good enough ."
it is more or less like eating <UNK> <UNK> .
so i have something easy to grab in the morning and <UNK> like them too !
"( singing ) i love lucy , but she 's not me ...."
"ok , so while there 's a few things we have in common , here 's the differences : my name 's not lucy ."
i 've never even been to nyc .
i 've never worn a loving cup on my head .
"even though by the time i knew about her she was already divorced from ricky and doing things like "" lucy "" on tv ."
but i 've always felt some <UNK> for the goofy <UNK> who got herself into a <#> crazy situations .
probably because i manage to do a lot of that myself .
"so , when it came time to name my blog , this just worked ."
"oh , that and i do have red hair from a box ."
"actually , i saw a blog by someone else i sort of know from another website , and thought it looked like fun ."
me - as far as who i am ....
"well , i 'm a <#> ( <UNK> ) year old married woman ."
we live in a <#> story house in a <UNK> town without even <#> real <UNK> .
i love to <UNK> and take pictures as well as lots of other stuff .
"i 'd love to take pictures on a professional basis , but do n't know if i 'll ever actually do it ."
"the kind of stuff i really like to take pictures of , i do n't see a lot of demand for ."
"nobody says , "" gee , i think i should hire a photographer to take a picture of that brick wall for me ."
i just prefer to take pictures of stuff that does n't talk back .
"if i want that , i can photograph my kids !"
"lol ricky - again , not his real name , but"
"i figure i only signed up here to <UNK> me , not him too ."
":) he 's also <#> , and just changed careers a year ago after having been a <UNK> for <#> years ."
he 's too creative to be stuck <UNK> people 's water bills for the rest of his life .
he now sells real estate and on the side sings in a band and plays guitar .
"the little <UNK> - we 've got <#> . none of them are jr 's , either ."
"i 'm not old enough to have <#> , and yet i nearly have <#> ."
", please , i think i see a few more grey hairs ."
";) s has been going on about <#> since she was oh , <#> ."
i 'm ready beyond belief for the <UNK> to stop .
"<#> cranky , <UNK> person in this house at a time is enough , thank you very much !"
"lol a. is the middle <#> , and our only boy ."
i swear the boy runs on high all the time .
"he 's a good kid , though and sometimes way too smart for his own good ."
"where s is all <UNK> , k is all girly girl ."
"i was more of a <UNK> , but love playing with the girly stuff , too ."
it 's also very true that the last child is the easiest .
"not quite as noisy as little ricky 's puppy , but psycho just the same ."
"we only got her a few days ago , but already she 's fitting right in ."
so far nobody 's called to complain about her barking all the time .
i 'll try to find something more exciting to post about next time .
"hey , there 's a little drool on your keyboard ."
"from next monday to friday we are opening up the church to visitors from <#> am to <#> pm , then having <UNK> meetings at <UNK> ."
then having a thanksgiving service on the saturday at <#> pm .
"we are so thankful to god for his <UNK> , and we are now so aware of the responsibility that now goes with it ."
reviewing what <UNK> wrote reminded me to comment on our family <UNK> .
"then when we got home , we just did n't sit down together at all , it seemed ."
"i know - it 's that they are an hour later than normal , and people 's blood - sugar gets low ."
"we have used the opportunity of the olympics to have "" family fun "" in front of the television , which basically involves us all cheering "" <UNK> !"
"<UNK> ! "" or "" teddy ! teddy ! """
"at any british <UNK> that are taking part , with the odd scream thrown in for good measure ."
"yes , some men do iron ! ( occasionally )"
"if you have the internet <UNK> to do this , you could also contribute to <UNK> boards ."
did you know there are boards out there where people are still able to debate real things as though opinions matter - even argue ?
it was a real meeting place of ideas - a modern <UNK> .
"so .... if you feel you can argue for christianity , go and find a <UNK> board to talk on as well ."
fellowship is great - and the fellowship we have had through <UNK> is amongst the best we have known - but we are called to <UNK> as well .
let us know if you need help in a particular discussion !
"as andrew king reminded us at the concert , i need a clean break ."
i have gone back to where i really belong : de <UNK> .
i will try to resist the temptation to make further postings to this blog for at least <#> year ... in your dreams !
"sorry for the delay in inviting everyone to post but there were a number of technical <UNK> , now sorted ."
if you were at the <UNK> this year and dave j had your email address then you should by now have received an invite to post .
"she 's an arab <UNK> cross <#> hands high , <UNK> , and spoiled rotten ."
she is proving to be quite a challenge - <UNK> and <UNK> ( nothing to do with what goes on the rear end of babies ) .
"i am experiencing a sharp learning curve and getting used to such expressions as "" skipping out "" ( no <UNK> )"
", "" fresh "" , "" de - <UNK> "" ( this involves a sharp knife ) and other such wonderful phrases ."
"i , of course , will have to work out how we turn a small horse into a <UNK> ."
a talk on <UNK> ( what are the <UNK> of god ? ) was a good opportunity to bring home the gospel .
( tim and andrew were last at <UNK> together <#> years ago . )
"well , time to finish - i have to be up at <UNK> to pick up andrew from his night - shift at <UNK> <UNK> ."
he 's making <UNK> for £ <#> an hour .
he comes home with his pockets full of tiny bits of the stuff which end up all over the house - it 's like christmas without the fun bit .
i must admit that i tend to get <UNK> ( post - <UNK> frustration ) as we return to a diet of 18th and 19th century <UNK> .
"the coming took oh such a long time the "" went "" confirmed it as the fastest week of the year ( moan ) ."
ann and <UNK> were also fantastic - practical and wise .
it gave us ladies a chance to share problems and ask questions .
"as usual the <UNK> concert proved to be a <UNK> of talent - oh , our young , young people !"
"what with jacob , lauren , <UNK> , robert ..... teens watch out the talent is closing fast !"
tom k as peter cook sounded just like his dad
! there was a good balance of music this year - it was n't dominated by any <#> particular style or family !
how good it is for brothers ( and sisters ) to dwell together !
"we will continue to remember debbie , susan , emma and <UNK> before him ."
"have n't got a clue what i 'm doing really , just feeling my way ."
apologies to larry <UNK> for messing with his song title as the title for this posting !
"it is interesting that to show his lover the depth of his feelings , he will give her a dozen red roses ."
you need to handle a <UNK> with as much love and care as the manner and thought behind which they were purchased .
"<#> wrong move can bruise easily , <UNK> ."
kept in the right place in the right conditions a cut rose can last for a long time .
indeed some roses have been <UNK> forever within a <UNK> packed glass <UNK> .
"fresh it is still the longing , still the <UNK> life changes but our <UNK> can remain inspired by christina <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> - <#> )"
"i’ve heard it in the <UNK> land and on the <UNK> sea yet , never , in <UNK> it ask a <UNK> of me ."
not to mention the underlying <UNK> that may be lingering just beneath the surface when a new mother <UNK> her own childhood .
i felt very much alone when i had my first - born .
"oh i know , i 'll get up and manage to apply a spot of make up , and wash my hair ."
then what - feed baby for the nth time that morning ... shall i go shopping ?
go to a coffee morning and meet other mothers who are also feeling like <UNK> in these early <UNK>
"oh dear , baby cries again , heart - piercing cries and i feel like i want to shout and scream ."
"do we favour working mothers , or are they feeling permanently guilty ?"
"are we supposed to stay at home , or do we feel inadequate against "" earth mothers "" ."
do we get enough support if we want to <UNK> ?
"usually we either chance upon the best source of support quite by accident , other times we are left to <UNK> for ourselves ."
there are some cultures who want to raise <UNK> independent children who are able to fight .
there are others who <UNK> on peace and family connections . yet more raise children to be able to kill for food .
daddy ’s got a new car a phone call from <UNK> : “
"it ’s got <UNK> seat positions , a <UNK> gear box and a cd that gives you directions !"
” so daddy ’s got a new car .
"it is green , with leather seats to match ."
"if driver number <#> comes along and wants to drive the car , he or she simply steps in and keys in number <#> ."
"the seat automatically shifts into the relevant position , as do the wing mirrors ."
<#> almost expects it to leap into action with “
i don’t want any sticky marks on this car like on the other car ! ”
"“ careful opening the door , don’t scratch the <UNK> ! ”"
so off we went for a drive to <UNK> .
we <UNK> in our destination to the cd and it began speaking in <UNK> <UNK> tones to us .
at last a female that knows where she is <UNK> “ road is being <UNK> ” “ proceed along the road for <#> miles .
” “ turn right at next <UNK> . ”
"we proceeded to turn left , believing the instructions to be incorrect ."
"” a small <UNK> on the dashboard shows the approach to the <UNK> , and the <UNK> to take ."
the cd ’s instructions took on a mind of their own : “ proceed along the road until you hit the next <UNK> ”
“ please avoid crashing into the car in <UNK> take the next turning and drive into the <UNK> ” “
"i <UNK> as to whether or not the <UNK> <UNK> on the car were automatic , i.e. switching on at the first drop of rain ."
"my husband sounded quite sad that in fact , no , they weren’t – but his colleague ’s were !"
"oh , and the best thing of all for us practical peeps ?"
"we had totally different ideas which meant i did n't feel as "" free "" to enjoy the children as i would have liked ."
their needs are biggest in the first <#> years .
"people that say "" always put your husband / wife "" first i think are missing the point of <UNK> ."
be <UNK> for totally <UNK> love for your children that you might think you have now
but you know it is a totally different love with your partner ...
the most important thing about having children is that the man understands his partner <UNK> enough to cope with the hormones changes etc .
", and not demand her to do anything she is n't ready to do ."
"it becomes very easy to shut the man out with all this going on in the background , and many men find this <UNK> hard to deal with ."
"having children is wonderful and can be a very <UNK> experience between the "" right "" people !"
"oh , and there 's nothing to beat the smell of your own baby 's head when they are all tucked up in their beds , fast asleep ... ...."
today is that sort of day that i am not sure what direction i am exactly going in at the moment .
my day started at <UNK> : i awake out of a deep sleep on a leather black sofa which i find to be very comfortable these past few weeks .
i awake and find a blank television screen staring back at me .
at <UNK> i began to make my coffee and smoked a cigarette in the front of my computer .
"while waiting for the coffee to <UNK> , i sat in front of my laptop attempting to <UNK> but to no avail the dam thing was not <UNK> on ."
the information highway was <UNK> at that time of the morning .
i walked up the stairs to my sleeping husband around <UNK>
"i called his name as i entered the room and said good morning c ... he said good morning <UNK> , i am still sleeping i need my rest ."
i did not give a rat ass that i was waking my husband .
i was craving some immediate mental attention and needed to talk about mindless shit .
he <UNK> and <UNK> before sitting on the edge of the bed .
"<UNK> do n't need to be anywhere until <#> am , i am going back to sleep ."
i got very pissed off that he did not want to get up and hang out with me early in the morning and simply chat .
he <UNK> a few <UNK> of coffee and asked what time is it .
i do n't know because we do n't have a clock nearby .
"i did not care what time it was considering he has not been home in the evenings , he has been very busy working late night shifts ."
i spoke to him about my agenda for the day and i wanted him to tell me about his .
<UNK> an hour : before he showered he suggested sex which lasted a good <#> minute before he came .
he looked at me and said that he thought we would be making love .
"i said to <UNK> , that is not making love that was simply a <#> minute fuck but that is ok ."
i really did not have the energy nor time to get pissed off from the act .
"i <UNK> to him that there is a difference between sex , fucking and making love ."
we started our day and i am too tire right now to keep typing about my thoughts .
"hello , i am a <#> year old woman that was <UNK> with <UNK> as a second grader and then in my <#> 's <UNK> with <UNK> ."
i live in a house alone with my cat .
i have had a daycare and just recently closed due to lack of kids <UNK> .
i years ago made mistakes when i was younger and not mature and responsible as much as i am now and wrote some bad checks and got scared .
so we all make mistakes and with learning and being taught people can change .
they said they tried they never sat down and taught me how to do alot of things and teach me alot of things i needed to know .
"they was busy with working , and other stuff never had time to sit down with me and help me ."
i am dating a wonderful fellow and he has gotten me to now for once stand up for myself and
i am the <#> that lives here not them !
i had impressions of my teeth made and backed out due to a close to getting a job .
well i decided to do the teeth and they said they wo n't hire me due to i wo n't start immediately .
i am now close to getting another job finally after <#> <UNK> of searching again and i am not missing this <#> up .
i will wait for the teeth and see if i get the job .
"well family is pissed and now have taken all my $ for gas , food away from me that i get from social <UNK> ."
i have enough food till monday then that is it .
i have barely enough gas to get somewhere if i am lucky around here right now
i will get work and when they let me have time off i will get the teeth done once .
i will have $ for food and gas and stuff while i am off a week or so .
i have turned this crisis into good though the living room furniture has been totally re - arranged and i have once a spare bedroom too .
i will be getting a new mattress and springs wed if all goes well for my room .
i feel like a human and feel proud of the house again .
keep the chin up and turn bad into good when things are rough makes it alot easier to deal with !
i believe in me and i will be ok no matter what !
there are a few people from my past i 'd like to say hi to and see what they 've been up to .
while a few posts ago i stated my hatred of all things michigan and having my life ripped away from me .
"with some of the money that i got from my <UNK> , i bought a martin <UNK> acoustic guitar and started re - learning how to play it ."
it had literally been years since i last played a guitar .
i stopped playing back when my first marriage <UNK> .
"i was n't very good to be sure , but i was learning little by little ."
but now i 'm back in full force learning everything i can .
the advantage is that i have all day long to practice and learn !
"i 've been playing now for <#> months now , by far the longest i 've ever spent on an interest other than computers and movies ."
"i usually get interested in something , absorb a vast about of knowledge about it , then <#> weeks later dump it in favor of something new ."
it 's the <UNK> real martin you can get .
"when i say "" real "" i mean made in usa , all solid wood construction ( no korean made <UNK> <UNK> here ) ."
it sounds like a dream now that <#> months of playing have opened up the wood and it <UNK> like a bell .
it 's like a never ending quest for a different tone .
"with the acoustic though , you concentrate on actually playing instead of effects ."
"i may be getting to the point though where i 'm going to have to start taking formal lessons , because i really have no direction in my learning ."
"i know the major chords by heart and quite a few minor and weird ones , plus some songs with alternate <UNK> .... but no theory really ."
the child darkest shadows come and sun is gone
we together bond in <UNK> love forbidden fruits we <UNK> we like <UNK> ourselves in vicious play
"talking to her about her writing really opens up her self to me , i learned alot about her from our <UNK> ."
"monday , man do i hate mondays and work ."
at least my boss was n't here today and i was free to actually get stuff done without her <UNK> ' face bothering me .
i wish there was <UNK> to get <UNK> back to <UNK> ever in the hell she was from .
"besides that , the day was excellent and her was near me most of the day , that was the best thing about the day ."
her perfume is still on my clothes ....... very nice
"well , this evening i was playing my guitar ."
"the piece that i was practicing was called "" <UNK> 's <UNK> "" by <UNK> <UNK> ."
it is a beautiful piece and has many subtle <UNK> and <UNK> that are very hard to capture .
it sounds amazing when all the notes come together and the runs blend in perfectly .
the real work gets done in the back and have witnessed many a miracle with the workers .
"the only reason i stayed so long is because of <#> person , her name shall remain a secret for a while ."
"she is smart and has an "" <UNK> potential "" that could turn into something special for me and this company ."
i was <UNK> ( or <UNK> if you will ) a software <UNK> session .
we are potentially going to be doing a very large ( for us ) software development .
it will probably turn out to be about £ <UNK> by the time everything 's done .
at the last minute he pulled out and asked me to <UNK> ( or moderate ) .
i was exhausted by the end of it - really brain - dead .
i think the reasons for this are partly cultural and partly commercial .
i 'll probably expand on this in a later blog .
if anyone out there has experience of the <UNK> <UNK> process or any other <UNK> techniques i would be very interested to read of your experiences .
"just a <UNK> <#> today as i 'm trying to learn the lines of the latest play i 'm in : "" <UNK> board "" by urllink graham <UNK> ."
we 're putting it on at the urllink valley theatre in <UNK> .
we 've had good reviews from the urllink <UNK> post and urllink <UNK> evening news and it only costs
£ <#> so what have you got to lose ( unless you 're living in melbourne ) ?
btw learning lines is a really good use for the ipod .
what i do is i record the whole thing onto my pc then i cut out all of my part .
rip it to mp3 and transfer to ipod using itunes and <UNK> !
"now then , the brakes ... the bike came with urllink <UNK> <UNK> on which were ok but never fantastic ."
") ) they failed completely , pulling right back to the bar ."
i checked their <UNK> and although it did say that you were only supposed to use <UNK> <UNK>
", there was nothing about not using <UNK> pads ."
"like most people i assumed that the "" only use <UNK> "" thing was just designed to help them sell more stuff ."
"i phoned them and got a real "" like it or lump it "" attitude from the guy i talked to ."
he <UNK> that the brakes had <UNK> and the master - <UNK> seal had gone .
", i think you 're going to need it ! "" , which i think was pretty good going for the <UNK> of the moment ."
so now i 've got some <UNK> new urllink hope mini <UNK> brakes .
these are great for the following reasons : they 're british !
"better than that , they 're northern ( tho from <UNK> ( small boo ! ) ) !"
the feel and <UNK> is fantastic - you can use <#> finger <UNK> going downhill .
"they look the business , black <UNK> <UNK> with gold <UNK> <UNK> , very <UNK> !"
"they do n't rub at all and , so far the pads seem to be lasting longer than the <UNK> ."
"anyway , i 've only had them for about <#> weeks"
so i 'll update you as and when .
"so the lesson is , do n't buy <UNK> , ever ."
i compete in a mountain bike <UNK> league which is here : urllink <UNK> - bike - o .
"with <#> events down i am <UNK> the <UNK> years to hold onto 9th place ( i am <#> , and the senior league is <#> - <#> ) ."
i reckon i need <#> good results out of the last <#> events to hold onto a top - ten finish ( my target for the year ) .
as a typical man i shall start by describing my mountain bike !
my mountain bike started off <#> and a half years ago as a stock urllink <UNK> <UNK> disk .
"over time i have replaced everything except the frame , stem and handle - bars ."
i have tried to wait til things wore out before replacing them .
this is the state of it the bike now : <UNK> : were originally : urllink <UNK> <#> comp .
when i heard that pace were bringing out the <UNK> <UNK> i decided to bring forward my purchase .
this turned out to be a good decision as i got a <UNK> equipped fork for the same price as a non - <UNK> .
having used a <UNK> i would never buy a fork without now .
it makes a huge difference on the road and up - hill on fire roads if you get out of the <UNK> .
in use the fork is very smooth and never seems to get out of control .
its particular strength is fast <UNK> tracks ( it is a race fork after all ) .
so i will let you know how i get on .
i had it <UNK> after <#> year and <#> of the springs had broken so i only waited <#> months for the next service .
at the next service another spring had broken so i am going to stay with <#> month services at the moment .
a broken spring does n't seem to make to much difference to the performance although the <UNK> were <UNK> <UNK> after the service .
"well as it 's beautifully sunny outside , i will finish now as i need to be out on the bike ."
"i am supposed to be at school at <UNK> this year , as opposed to 8:00 last year ."
i had a hard time getting there at <#> much less <UNK> !
":( i got up early , got ready ; no problems ."
"<UNK> , my <#> year old , says her tummy hurts when i get her up ."
"ok , no big deal , no throw up , let 's get dressed , let 's go ."
"sounds cold , i know , but i 'm trying to start the year with an on time record ."
"we are at the garage door getting ready to walk out and , you guessed it , she throws up !"
"i clean her up , change her , throw a <UNK> on the mess and <UNK> out the door ."
i call my <UNK> during my conference period and she has already thrown up <#> more times !
"today was much better , i must say ."
"i am excited in some ways ( new start , new supplies , etc . )"
"however , i am sad to have to drop off my <#> year old at the <UNK> tomorrow ."
"i have the best <UNK> in the world but , well , if you are a parent you know ."
"we made numerous library trips , a trip to the zoo , trips to the park and pool ."
"i guess i should be thankful that i have such a "" kid - friendly "" profession ."
"i would n't want it any other way , really ."
i get to do what i love all year long .
i am a little down tonight ... not sure why .
"maybe it 's all the changes in my schedule coming up , maybe it 's money issues , maybe it 's my weight ."
i have made a commitment to walk everyday either before or after school .
i have a great teacher friend who wants to walk so i will jump on that opportunity .
we had open house for the 8th graders on monday night .
it is always a dreaded day on my part b/c i go from 7:30 that morn .
"after open house , however , i was happy with how it went ."
it 's fun to see your new students and parents .
"a friend ( nixon <UNK> ) directed me to his blog and i thought it pretty cool , so here i am with my own blog !"
just thought i would post a trial run here before i went any further .
have emailed him re a tour for me and am hoping to hear from him today !
was feeling slightly desperate ( not to mention sweaty )
when i happened upon the <UNK> inn <UNK> ever . . .
"i could have hugged him , he was so nice ."
":) upon arriving safely in <UNK> ( to my great surprise ) , i found that my hotel room here is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> . . ."
"as it turns out , this is the <#> that is <UNK> , while yesterday 's was a bargain at <UNK> ( a fact i learned at <UNK> ) ."
this room 's view is also beautiful and there is a garden with <UNK> deck chairs below that i may have to experience before my departure .
i have already <UNK> most of the town and eaten at the best restaurant so far of my visit . . .
the tomatoes in my <UNK> and tomato salad were so perfectly red and <UNK> that i almost had tears in my eyes upon seeing and tasting them .
is that the sign of a food explorer gone over the edge ?
"i <UNK> my waiter , whom i <UNK> to choose my entire meal for me except the salad . . ."
"he did not let me down , as the <UNK> ( a san <UNK> ? ) was lovely and the <UNK> with local <UNK> <UNK> ."
we are now fast friends and i think i may even return there for dinner .
"it felt significantly less friendly than <UNK> until i had lunch , which was delightful ( see below ) ."
then i had to de - board myself in order to <UNK> a ticket from the newspaper stand !
all of this was under the <UNK> yet <UNK> eye of a <UNK> bus driver .
"on the bright side , i arrived safely and my hotel room is <UNK> , or at least the view is . . ."
a sweeping view of the valley below from a balcony onto which wood framed glass doors open .
"for the first time , i tried a local white wine ( it seemed appropriate , given the warm and sunny weather ) , which was excellent ."
this was accompanied by a nice <UNK> salad and thin pasta noodles with bits of duck <UNK> in ( you may be <UNK> a theme here . . .
) i also saw the largest pepper <UNK> ever . . .
"it must have been <#> feet long -- yes , it 's true !"
"<UNK> , a waitress there had the most <UNK> yet <UNK> laugh i have ever heard !"
( i now am well on my way to being a <UNK> blonde from <UNK> ! ) .
so i will probably keep the museum visits fairly brief .
"will have to update you later on my yesterday , which was spent in lovely <UNK> . ."
"( french for "" i am very tired ! "" . . ."
"actually , it is just my feet that are really tired )"
"<UNK> ( also ) , i have learned that i <UNK> think and speak in french here , no matter how hard i study my italian phrase book !"
perhaps you can find out what part of the brain causes <#> to do that ! :)
"rome is an <UNK> , chilly and sometimes rainy place today ."
"so , i did as much as i could outdoors until the rain really threatened , then found indoor activities ."
"for a non - religious person , i have had a lot of religion in my day !"
"met up with my tour guide , who it turns out is <UNK> , rather than the old woman i had <UNK> ."
"i think i counted <#> , which was not all of them , and it is not a very large area ) ."
"this lasted about <#> years , until the liberation of the area , which now remains a center for jewish life in rome ."
"after i took my leave of my tour guide , i walked through the <UNK> neighborhood , which is nice and <UNK> . enjoyed the scene"
", checked out a ( relatively ) small church and then located another hole in the wall for lunch ."
"lots of pots and <UNK> hanging from the ceiling , small and cozy rooms , just <#> <UNK> for the whole place , who were constantly on the move !"
i was in a room so small it had only <#> tables .
"at <#> of them , an old man was on a tear about something . ."
"had a simple but good lunch , with pasta and then <UNK> <UNK> for dessert . . ."
"also <UNK> the house red , which was pretty nice ."
"<UNK> with <UNK> after my nice meal , i promptly became totally lost ."
"i ended up at some castle , but was not in the mood to tour it ."
"so , i decided to pop in as long as i was so close ."
"i really wanted to visit the <UNK> chapel , but it was already closed for the day , so i 'll save that for next weekend ."
"i think i will do the latter , as my feet are much better rested now that i have been sitting for a bit ."
"also , my internet time is about to run out !"
i have taken some photos that i think may turn out wonderfully .
"thankfully , i am already <#> % <UNK> and in an "" i 'm in rome "" frame of mind . . ."
"well , i 'm off to get a glass of wine ( or <UNK> . . ."
can not decide ! ) and then a good night of sleep so i can enjoy all the things i have planned for tomorrow .
i have seen the most incredible places in the last week . .
"! first , i will give a nod to <UNK> . . ."
"great city , very pretty , you can almost picture romeo and <UNK> when you look at the balcony from which they ( <UNK> ) spoke ."
i received my first marriage proposal there from a guy whose last name is ( incredibly ) <UNK> and whom i had known for all of <#> minutes .
he approached me in the street and asked if he could practice his english with me .
"i said that would be fine , but he would have to walk along with me to the next place i wanted to visit ."
i left that evening for <UNK> ( by train ) and flew from <UNK> to <UNK> the next morning .
i hardly know where to begin in describing <UNK> .
"everywhere you look , you see <UNK> pointing <UNK> from ancient <UNK> ( see the attached picture ) ."
"<UNK> constantly approach , some trying to sell <UNK> or <UNK> , some just being friendly , others interested in your blonde hair and blue eyes ."
"<UNK> throughout the day , the sound of the call to prayer rings out , with a man chanting verses from the <UNK> ."
"in brief , i loved every <#> of the <#> days i spent in <UNK> !"
"my hostel window looked out on the <UNK> <UNK> , a <UNK> so old it is only used as a museum now . on the way to the hostel"
", i met a japanese girl who was my roommate while in <UNK> ."
"we met no less than <#> <UNK> men en route to the hostel , <#> whose mother made us a traditional <UNK> dinner that night ."
"after dinner , we were treated to a viewing of american pie on a <UNK> cd . ."
. the movie was in english but with <UNK> and chinese <UNK> !
"it took me all of the first day to learn to say "" thank you "" in <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"day <#> in turkey included meeting jonathan <UNK> 's friend <UNK> ( thanks , jonathan ! ! ) at the blue <UNK> ."
<UNK> then helped me select a carpet from the nice carpet <UNK> who <UNK> me outside the <UNK> .
he served us apple tea in his shop while we looked at what seemed like a <#> <UNK> .
and i spent the rest of the day checking out some other sights and <UNK> at a place where the <UNK> <UNK> stood and belly danced .
<UNK> was able to add lots of interesting commentary on the things we saw .
"for instance , she explained that the different belly dance styles we saw reflected different <UNK> in turkey ."
<UNK> and i also visited a place where several <UNK> and their families are buried .
"as with the <UNK> , we had to take our shoes off in order to visit this place ."
my new australian friend ( <UNK> ) and i visited the <UNK> palace the next day to see where the <UNK> <UNK> and kept their <UNK> .
"we then <UNK> to the grand <UNK> , where the level of <UNK> increased <UNK> from that we found in the streets ."
the <UNK> are all painted in traditional <UNK> designs and are incredibly beautiful !
"dinner was great and the company was delightful ( thanks , gary and linda , for putting me in touch with <UNK> , she is so cool ! ) ."
we then walked the <UNK> <UNK> part of <UNK> .
"much to my dismay , my final day in turkey arrived all too soon ."
we crossed into the black sea and <UNK> into a small village with a gorgeous deserted castle on a hill .
"i <UNK> in an effort to change my plane ticket so i could have more time in <UNK> , but to no avail . . ."
i never knew we brought the other side 's soldiers to the us before meeting him .
he was really nice and not bitter at all . .
the subject only came up when i asked him while we were chatting about the <UNK> how he learned his very good english .
. an underground restaurant with brick <UNK> and walls and <UNK> that permit you to hear all the other tables ' conversations .
i made another good new friend in <UNK> . .
"<UNK> , an <UNK> from canada who is halfway through her year 's leave from <UNK> and young ."
"luckily , i avoided the political <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> by leaving any place that was <UNK> with police . . ."
"on my last night there , several people were tear <UNK> and injured during a protest about some newly installed conservative government members ."
"i left <UNK> last night for <UNK> , where i am now !"
"<UNK> is <UNK> and beautiful , with rows of traditional cute german buildings set in the middle of a forest and next to a river ."
i can not believe my tour is nearly over . .
"only <#> more cities after this ( <UNK> , <UNK> and paris ) , then i fly home !"
so this is my last update for you . . .
"i look forward to returning home to sleep in my own bed , hug <UNK> the dog and see all of you again !"
i have used these <UNK> <UNK> you expressions of italy heavily during the past week !
"i hope all of you are well and happy ! as always , thanks for the emails . ."
the link to home and reality is much <UNK> !
"when i last wrote , i had left <UNK> ( <UNK> ) for <UNK> <UNK> , italy , an all <UNK> day trip ."
"first was a <#> hour train from <UNK> to the border of france and spain , then a <#> hour <UNK> in a town that consisted of . ."
"as a <UNK> and <UNK> wine <UNK> , the customer concluded that the <#> with <#> % more alcohol was the better <#> . ."
<#> of the benefits of being <#> and no longer <UNK> for the youth pass ! )
"accordingly , i hosted my first wine tasting party on the road and the <UNK> even approved our event ."
"many hours later i arrived in the <UNK> <UNK> , a group of <#> fishing <UNK> along the <UNK> coast of italy ( on the <UNK> ) ."
the view was amazing ( and you can see it in the attached photo ) !
"i read and soaked up the sun for a while , then set out for the next town and my youth hostel ."
"of course , the hostel was closed , but luckily there was a <UNK> just across the square which was lovely . ."
"the manager , an <UNK> , designed it . as you know"
", i <UNK> in the excellent <UNK> i rarely experience , and this was wonderful . ."
"dinner that night was at <UNK> billy , where the customers were me and a group of <#> italian men . . ."
my first introduction on this trip to that particular species .
billy serves a mean <UNK> and pasta ; the <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> of <UNK> .
"i spent the next day exploring the various fishing <UNK> , each of which were beautiful and unique ."
"<UNK> to take their word for it , rather than their actions , i took the "" high road "" <UNK> ."
the only <UNK> i suffered was an old woman <UNK> down at me from her window as i emerged from the gate .
"<UNK> that town , i hopped a train and <UNK> from the fourth village to the fifth . ."
i only met <#> <UNK> and <#> native during the entire hike .
"when i finally reached the village of <UNK> al <UNK> , i found a <UNK> game in progress next to the beach ."
"that night , i checked out the <UNK> <UNK> with a german guy who was staying at my <UNK> . ."
we found that <UNK> is not a concept well - established in the area but <UNK> away the time in a bar watching italian tv shows with the owner .
"i left early the next morning for <UNK> , italy , which is outside <UNK> ."
we also discussed our dogs and he admired my pictures of <UNK> .
it makes me laugh to think about these italian sea <UNK> and <UNK> knowing about <UNK> . .
i knew he was destined for world fame !
"after leaving <UNK> , i reached <UNK> , a beautiful old town where cars are practically banned in the center of the city ."
this town and the <UNK> where i stayed are among my favorites so far on the trip .
( this is apparently a tradition in italy ) .
"<UNK> tearing myself away from <UNK> , i headed south for <UNK> , italy , to see the <UNK> coast ."
"my first day in <UNK> , i <UNK> the town ( <UNK> high above the ocean ) and had a delightful dinner where <UNK> and david were my <UNK> ."
david is attending a high school for those who wish to make a career of restaurant work and is doing some kind of <UNK> at the restaurant .
he and <UNK> were so fun and always stopped by to keep me company when they were not busy .
"the next day , i visited <UNK> , a town buried by <UNK> when mt ."
and that was forgotten until the <UNK> began <UNK> it in this century .
"after waiting out the storm , we were treated to nice enough weather to make the visit worthwhile ."
"i can not believe how many <UNK> , columns and <UNK> were found intact after all those years buried in <UNK> rocks !"
they also have <UNK> <UNK> of the residents who were buried in the <UNK> that show the terror and desperation of the <UNK> .
the tour was incredible and the many dogs who live in the ruins helped fill in for my dog <UNK> ( temporarily ) !
"earlier that day , at breakfast , i met an american woman from washington , d.c ."
we met for dinner that night and had a great time at <UNK> <UNK> .
"i set out the next day for <UNK> , via <UNK> , where i experienced the first truly dark shadow on my trip ."
i knew i could replace the camera ( and have already done so . . .
"it is covered by insurance ) , but the other items are definitely a loss i feel deeply ."
"on the way to <UNK> , i met a nice older couple on the train and that also cheered me up ."
"<UNK> , where i am now , is an incredible city !"
i love that there are no cars on the island . . .
"they use boats for everything , including the ambulance , <UNK> , vegetable <UNK> , ups , water <UNK> , mail delivery , etc ."
i attended a classical music concert last night in a gorgeous church with an incredible <UNK> ( ? )
solo by a guy named <UNK> and then met some really fun kentucky girls in a pub on the way home .
"today i <UNK> to the tourist role , visiting the huge st ."
"marks <UNK> with its <UNK> and <UNK> - <UNK> altar piece , <UNK> stolen from <UNK> and spectacular <UNK> <UNK> floor ."
"i also saw the greatest museum -- <UNK> <UNK> former home , which she <UNK> to the city along with her private art collection ."
"the art was nice and the house was wonderful , facing right onto the grand canal at <#> of its most beautiful points ."
"i should end this <UNK> letter now , if any of you are still with me !"
"i leave for <UNK> in <#> days and plan , in the meantime , to visit <UNK> <#> day and see more of <UNK> on the other ."
this is going to be a quick and dirty update for my time in spain !
let 's just say its length will <UNK> <UNK> to my spanish speaking abilities !
"so , when i left you last i had just arrived in madrid ."
"my train <UNK> on the way to madrid included <#> <UNK> , <#> <UNK> and <#> older man who we think was spanish ."
"he traveled with a large box that took up nearly our whole <UNK> , a <UNK> to transport the box and another <UNK> he had not yet <UNK> ."
no <#> in the <UNK> had heard this song before .
"we suspect , however , that it was used to <UNK> his children each day , which explains his solo state of travel when we made his <UNK> ."
"seriously , though , he seemed very nice and was actually quiet until he displayed his <UNK> tendencies toward morning <UNK> ."
"thanks for the restaurant <UNK> , david <UNK> !"
"also at <UNK> , i met some incredibly funny <UNK> who tried to take me out dancing ."
they had the classic british dry sense of humor and made me laugh like crazy .
we were treated to traditional spanish music by some university students who play at the restaurants for extra money .
"the next day , i took a day trip to <UNK> , a charming town built on hills with very twisted streets and <UNK> architecture ."
"in the station , i made friends with maria , who made sure i found my train ."
she teaches english to adults and is happy to have retired from teaching children of middle school age .
"<#> of these boys ( angel , <UNK> and <UNK> ) sat across from us . according to maria"
", they were very curious about me and <UNK> amongst themselves regarding how to start a conversation with me ."
"i took the bull by the horns ( this being spain , after all ) and asked them in spanish what their names were ."
"next thing i knew , a flood of perfect english questions poured forth from the boys and their friends ."
<#> little girl shouted out her address and invited me to stay with her and her parents .
i would love to see the looks on their faces if an american girl with a huge backpack showed up at their house !
i know that my photo of the boys and myself together will be <#> of my favorites from the trip !
i was impressed by the dedication of a couple of japanese guys who were <UNK> around their father in his wheelchair on the steep and <UNK> <UNK> streets .
the city was very beautiful and even the long walk back to the train station offered wonderful views of the surrounding area and <UNK> of the city .
"i left madrid after <#> days and headed to <UNK> , home of the <UNK> ."
it was an amazing set of <UNK> on a <UNK> with an incredible view of the <UNK> <UNK> .
"although the mountains were snow - covered , i was walking around without a jacket most of the time !"
i also completed a very long hike up to a <UNK> above the <UNK> .
"it was a <UNK> day , however , because i was catching a night train to <UNK> ."
<UNK> is the city i would plan if i could design my own town . .
"ocean , mountains , great architecture , interesting <UNK> , wonderful food and cultural events and a very cool <UNK> ."
i stayed in a youth hostel that served beer from a <UNK> machine . .
not something you often see in the states !
"it 's crowded with <UNK> , bird <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , hard to explain , but very social and fun ."
i loved <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> buildings and the <UNK> museum best of everything i saw .
"well , i need to run because i am attending a classical music concert this evening ."
"i am in <UNK> , italy right now , which will be featured <UNK> in the next update !"
"i am writing from an internet cafe right off the plaza del <UNK> in sunny madrid , spain ."
"i crossed the border into spain late last night and arrived here early this morning , along with my new australian friends <UNK> and richard ."
i will tell you all about spain in the next installment of my reports so that i can catch you up on my french adventures today !
"when i last wrote you , i had just arrived in tours ."
"the sun came out , considerably improving my mood , and tours is a beautiful city with great <UNK> ."
<#> of my favorites was a wax museum that told the history of the <UNK> region .
"i took a bit of a church break in tours , seeing only <#> ( i usually average <#> - <#> church <UNK> per day ) ."
i also took a morning trip out to <UNK> ( the town ) to see <UNK> ( the <UNK> ) .
"that said , it was worth it to see an amazing castle on such a gorgeous day and my knee is feeling much better now ."
i was surprised at how cold <UNK> are -- i guess that explains the clothing style of the former <UNK> !
"but i think i could build a fire and find a way to make do , if forced to do so ! on the train from tours to <UNK>"
", i met a woman who taught english in <UNK> for many years ."
"i was right -- nothing was open , so i <UNK> myself to spending only the day there ."
"<UNK> when <UNK> , the train station <UNK> ( who has worked for the <UNK> for <#> years ) stepped in ."
( you will never take those things for granted again if you travel like i have traveled this week ! )
"i should mention that on the way home , <UNK> stopped the car so i could take a good look at the city of <UNK>"
( you may look at the attached picture now ) .
i decided to spend the entire weekend with <UNK> and <UNK> because the city was so gorgeous and their house so comfortable .
"the story of <UNK> is that hundreds of years ago , the residents found a perfectly <UNK> body on what is now the <UNK> <UNK> chapel there ."
"they decided it was <UNK> , the tax <UNK> from the bible , and that it was a miracle that they found him in such a condition ."
"below that is a "" grand <UNK> "" religious <UNK> have climbed on their knees that leads down to the village and several shops ."
", i attended a catholic mass ( there is no other kind of church in france , apparently ! )"
that was all in french but still sounded awfully familiar .
"i <UNK> left <UNK> monday morning for <UNK> , where i would later catch the train for madrid ."
yesterday was therefore spent traveling and running various errands during my <UNK> in between trains .
"well , i must go enjoy the day , which i believe will include a visit to the <UNK> museum and a stroll through <UNK> <UNK> gardens ."
"tonight the <UNK> and i will engage in the traditional madrid "" <UNK> tour "" which involves hopping from place to place to try different spanish <UNK> ."
"sorry this update is so long , but it was an eventful week !"
i hope your week is great and thanks again to all for the e - mails !
"i am sitting in the hottest copy shop in all of france -- hot meaning warm , not cool ."
"please send me your mailing address , anyone who would like a card !"
"my french - speaking capabilities have <UNK> from decent to <UNK> awful , but i am already starting to think in french sometimes ! as you would expect"
", some people are incredibly nice and some are not ."
"sat down , thought about revenge on let 's go , <UNK> asking garbage truck drivers who came to this isolated place for ride back to station ."
help arrived in the form of a sweet ( and cute ) special <UNK> !
begged <UNK> information desk people to hold pack while i visited the <UNK> .
"in <UNK> , <UNK> french bus schedule and feared i would not get back to <UNK> before info desk closed for night ."
"tried to find internet source last night , got bad info from hotel hosts , met kind <UNK> girl who led me on internet hunt , then to dinner ."
i never realized how much work it is to make all plans and do all <UNK> on your own !
even this computer keyboard is a challenge -- it must be arranged to <UNK> keys commonly used in french .
"all in all , however , i am very glad to be here and am learning a lot , not just about france ."
i should grab some lunch ( it 's <#> hours earlier here than in illinois and texas ) .
have a great day and talk to you again soon !
thanks to those who sent e - mails already -- it 's nice to read friendly messages from home !
"but that 's just my take on "" toilet "" ."
"i guess we could pretend to be british and use "" <UNK> "" , but i think "" water closet "" is actually the most <UNK> term . . ."
provided there is actually a physical toilet that <UNK> .
"really , i hate toilet talk more probably more than anyone on earth , but being a <UNK> makes it sort of an <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i personally would rather drop over dead of <UNK> - <UNK> distress than discuss it , but here i am , asking those sorts of questions for a living ."
i never thought i 'd live long enough to discuss <UNK> habits and the like .
"i 'm sure that "" jimmy the greek "" had some odds on whether or not i 'd make it out of my twenties ."
"amazingly , i did . and practicing medicine ."
"internal medicine , of all things , which makes "" toilet talk "" a real <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i 'm sorry , but doctor or no , it is kind of funny , but believe it or not , there is science to this ."
we are not just making fun of you and having a good time at your expense .
i went to this party at a <UNK> called the <UNK> house recently .
i had to excuse myself to the water closet .
sitting on top of a chair with a pillow underneath it was a horn .
or more like a trumpet with which <#> would sound charge on a fox hunt .
"i came out and could n't stop laughing . later on , my friend wanda needed to use the "" restroom "" ."
i told her there was something funny in there and i wanted her to tell me what it was when she came back .
"wanda returned to our table and said , "" oh my god ! "" ."
"as i 've said a couple of times before , i hate toilet talk , but here i go again anyway ."
what the hell is that trumpet doing in the <UNK> .
"i mean , i know a good number of my elderly patients <UNK> over their <UNK> and such ; is it the trumpet of relief ?"
"i do nt know , but i hope people blow that thing with their lips ."
that 's all i 'm going to say about it .
someone at our table took a picture of it so i have proof .
"i was standing in line for the free movie passes from "" creative <UNK> "" for "" suspect <#> "" in atlanta with the other <UNK> ."
i have to go back to work in november .
"i used to wear them with little <UNK> on the top ; now i am <#> , but without the <UNK> ."
"well , in this case , i read a review for spike lee 's new movie , "" she hate me "" ."
the first line of the review made me laugh and sort of reminded me of myself . . .
"it read as follows : "" she hate me "" / f "" an unbelievable mess from spike lee ."
""" i just laughed out loud standing in line ."
"a fellow <UNK> , creative or not , struck up a conversation ."
he asked if i knew what movie the passes were for we were trying to get for free .
that it was something that i actually wanted to see .
""" really ? "" he wanted to hear more . "" yes . """
"the other <UNK> said , "" you seem really very interesting , what did you do in alaska ? """
i told him that i 'm a doctor .
"i told him that was nice , but <UNK> do a lot of surgery and i get dizzy wearing a mask . . ."
"oh , thank heaven , here they come with the passes ."
"<UNK> , "" you seem really very interesting . """
"i said , "" yeah , a lot of people have told me that ."
"i 'm not sure why , exactly . """
"<UNK> , "" well , if you want to see a movie , i 've got passes . """
hello : let ’s see where do i start ? from as far back
as i can remember i have always been an <UNK> person .
"i remember being called “ <UNK> ” , “ <UNK> ” , “"
” those things hurt when you are in grade school .
the clothes that were around in the <#> ’s for large people were not the most <UNK> .
critics always said to wear stripes that go up and down not around so as to not <UNK> your mid section . and
which way did the strips go on the clothes for large people ; well they went around not up and down .
so we all looked like a huge tire .
and to top it off they were <UNK> knit .
when all the other kids were wearing cool clothes and jeans with cute shirts or <UNK> i was wearing my <UNK> knit stripes going around not down .
i started getting somewhat <UNK> in junior high ( 7th and 8th grades ) .
i was still not as skinny as the <UNK> .
i wanted to fit in so i bought <UNK> and tight fitting shirts .
i must have looked like i was <UNK> into these clothes .
"i was afraid to bend over in the <UNK> , heck i was afraid to walk in them ."
my butt was so big it nearly made the mini seem like a suggestion of a skirt .
in my freshman year of high school i started losing weight .
i was riding my ten speed bike at least <#> - <#> miles every day after school .
i didn’t eat much if anything all day at school .
it would make me sick to smell it .
but i weighed my <UNK> during my high school years .
i wore a size <#> to <#> depending on how it was made .
i had an hour glass figure if i do say so myself .
married my husband of <#> years had a total of <#> kids in that marriage .
never was able to lose the weight gained from those <#> <UNK> .
"i tried every weight loss <UNK> out there , some of them twice ."
i would lose <#> lbs here or <#> lbs there only to gain it all back plus some .
i tried watching what i was eating and that didn’t seem to work .
i tried to be more <UNK> of when i was eating and why .
that helped me maintain and not gain anymore weight for about <#> years .
i stayed stable at <#> lbs for a long time .
then i had a difficult time in my life and had a lot of family issues to deal with and turned to food as a comfort .
i have known this for a long time but just chose to not deal with it .
"a really good friend of mine , karen angela “ moore ” <UNK> , sent me a website <UNK> medical institute ( urllink <UNK> ) ."
there was a <UNK> from a guy that had the <UNK> <UNK> procedure and he was <#> months out from the surgery .
he was singing it ’s <UNK> along with <UNK> as a facility .
i <UNK> all the options and looked at both the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> .
the <UNK> is much more <UNK> and permanent .
the <UNK> is less <UNK> and is <UNK> .
you can read more about the procedures by visiting this website listed below .
you can also do a search by typing in <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> .
( urllink <UNK> ) i made a decision that i wanted the <UNK> .
i had to decide if i wanted to go to <UNK> which is in mexico or have the procedure done in the states .
i went for a <UNK> at a hospital in los angeles ( i will mention no names ) .
i was not thrilled and was to be honest quite scared .
the surgeon did not know what some of my <UNK> were used for .
he thought my blood pressure medication was a <UNK> cream .
he could not tell me how many of these operations had been done at this hospital .
"he did not know when the band was approved for use by the <UNK> in the states , which was in june <#> ."
"so needless to say , i decided to have the procedure done at <UNK> in mexico ."
and it was the best decision i have ever made and haven’t <UNK> it .
"so , on april 4th , <#> i traveled by train to san diego from van <UNK> , ca ."
i highly encourage you to visit the <UNK> website and experience all they have to offer .
it was a truly up - lifting experience and <#> i will cherish and use in my everyday life .
such a healing environment right on the pacific ocean .
karen and i would go to bed every night with the waves crashing to <UNK> us to sleep .
"i was in such good hands before , during , and after my surgery ."
everyone was truly concerned and interested in my well being .
"so , on april 6th , <#> my life was forever changed as this is the day i had my surgery ."
the procedure itself takes about <#> to <#> min .
it was truly fast and the surgeon said everything was perfect .
this makes a <UNK> about the size of between <UNK> to <UNK> depending on the surgeon .
the purpose of the tube and port is if at some point you stop losing weight then they will <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> the size of the opening .
"my <UNK> in the band after surgery was empty , now i have a <UNK> fill ."
by the way there is no cutting or <UNK> of the stomach .
it is like a taking a balloon and <UNK> it in the middle to form a top and bottom with an opening in between the <#> .
"juan <UNK> , that performed my procedure is the <#> that goes to the states and teaches some of the <UNK> there to do the procedure ."
i now have <#> of his <UNK> as my follow up surgeon here in the states .
"<UNK> billy and he is located in <UNK> , ca ."
"that is only an hour from me as opposed to <UNK> , mexico which is <#> to <#> hours away ."
i no longer just decide i will eat a burger and fries in under <#> min .
i have to decide what will easily flow through the opening in my <UNK> and make sure the food is of <UNK> <UNK> prior to <UNK> .
i also have to listen to my body while eating .
"it will tell me when i am full by signs like <UNK> or chest pains , <UNK> , <UNK> ( which i have experienced ) ."
the <UNK> will come if you do not listen to the <UNK> or <UNK> .
i don’t like to vomit so i listen .
it has taken me an hour to eat a <UNK> of <UNK> piece of <UNK> and <#> french fry .
i just take my time and enjoy the food and the company while i eat .
protein shakes are <#> way to get protein in your diet .
you can get some protein from fresh vegetables as well in the form of <UNK> after this surgery .
<UNK> are good too just make sure you chew the chunks really well before <UNK> .
"so , i can eat just about any foods now ."
i eat <#> meals a day and try to not have snacks through out the day .
i started fitness training about a month after the surgery .
i now walk approximately <#> miles a day .
i try to get in some weight training as well but that <UNK> .
i have had some minor set backs along the way .
i had to have a second surgery with dr .
billy to revise my port as it was <UNK> and hard to access .
the cruel master of our lives spoke <UNK> this morning .
"so , i rolled over , curled with <UNK> , and wished her a happy birthday ."
"it is angry water , breaking walls , and turning wheels day ."
the plan is to limit her doing much around the house today .
i have put a load in the <UNK> and a load in the dryer .
"she took kyle to school ( necessary , cuz she would be cleaning house if i were gone to do it ) ."
"chelsea is up , but <UNK> , so we decided to force her to stay home from school ."
she did her litter box <UNK> and then did the dishes .
there is still a little more laundry duty for me .
i could n't resist a little ' men do n't know how to do laundry ' humor .
"i mean , everyone knows that we do that just to be tossed out of the laundry room ."
"of course , we ca n't stop her from doing anything ."
"happy birthday honey , and for your birthday we want to show you how much we do n't need you by doing it all ourselves ."
"so , in a twisted sort of way , letting her wash my dirty underwear"
"gives her a sense of <UNK> , a sense of being needed ."
they do the same trick with the helpless act about fixing the sink or the toilet .
"i did my own cooking , cleaning , laundry , toilet fixing , and jar opening ."
"fortunately , <UNK> came along to save me ."
the room has a <UNK> <UNK> tub and the walls break away to make it part of the room .
i will just say it is sweet to have a son - in - law in hotel management .
here it is .. picnic sunday let me back up to the birthday celebration .
we went to todd 's karaoke to celebrate a few birthdays .
"crystal , <UNK> , and shawn 's are on wednesday ."
the <#> in the middle were bought by others wishing her a happy birthday .
"we sang , laughed , hugged and kissed everyone around ."
<UNK> told me she was gonna take advantage of me but by the time i got to bed she was passed out .
we got up this morning and started the <UNK> .
<UNK> went to the nursing home to get her mom .
"i filled up the <UNK> , ketchup , and mustard bottles ."
talking to her is like coming in in the middle of a movie and trying to catch up .
you never know who is <UNK> in the corner .
we picked up the <UNK> that we forget to get at wal - <UNK> - mart .
"by the time we were ready to leave , there were <#> kids on the porch wanting to go to the picnic ."
we packed a few into the <UNK> and the rest into the lincoln and away we went .
we got to the park and there was not <#> picnic table available .
they found a couple sitting at <#> of the picnic tables reading .
"they were not using the grill , so they asked the if they minded giving up the table ."
"i do not want to know what <UNK> techniques they used , but , they got the table ."
we had sweet and sour cole <UNK> and <UNK> eggs .
there were bags of chips and pop on ice .
it was a hot sunday afternoon filled with good food and good friends .
it was <#> of those ' kinda make ya think things are alright ' days .
tomorrow is our bi - weekly picnic for about <#> people .
"so , we have been on a supply run ."
<UNK> has to be at work at sonic from <#> til <#> .
chris has to be at <UNK> ’s pizza from <#> til <#> .
he worked last night until <#> at <UNK> ’s and then went to work at <UNK> ho ’s until <UNK> .
we have to be at <UNK> at <UNK> for a birthday get together for <UNK> and some other friends that share close birthdays .
we went to the local wal - mart <UNK> - mart for our picnic supplies .
this place is the size of a small third world country .
i believe wal - mart ’s are built on large <UNK> <UNK> .
how else does <#> explain the constant stream of <UNK> flowing thru their doors ?
on your first visit you are <UNK> by aliens and <UNK> with a highly addictive shopping drug .
the lights at wal - mart produce an eerie <UNK> glow which feeds the addiction .
wal - mart knows that all they have to do is get you in the store .
"you find your car <UNK> turning into parking lot anytime you are driving by , as if drawn by some magical source ."
nothing real exists outside of the wal - mart .
"you think that you went home after your first visit , but you never left the store ."
"you are <UNK> to a large bank of bodies , sharing thoughts , experiences , feeding the ‘"
<UNK> your mind fights but it is too <UNK> by the <UNK> of the shopping drug .
on aisle <#> is a little old lady giving free samples of <UNK> .
the <UNK> is in the sample of the chili cheese <UNK> corn chips .
"ok , here we are , <#> days from t - day ."
i have involved more people in the plot and left a few red <UNK> around to throw the dogs off of the trail .
<#> part of the birthday present has arrived and been given to <UNK> .
there is a sick and twisted <UNK> funny website that we visit regularly .
it is urllink <UNK> will press : : .
<#> of the characters at this <UNK> site is <UNK> - e .
he is an <UNK> squirrel with a love for little purple pills with the <UNK> 's on them .
"from this site , i ordered a shirt for her with <UNK> - e on it and a <UNK> which <UNK> "" extra medication for all "" ."
"the rest of the plot and present involves the kids , hers and mine ."
"i will give you a hint , but only a small <#> , because she reads my blog , as any good wife would ( lol ) ."
"( of course , you know this is for her .."
"right now she is scratching her head going , "" huh ? "" )"
<UNK> is under the desk being <UNK> gas free ( so far ) .
"<UNK> escaped last <UNK> morning , but only went as far as behind her <UNK> ."
dude tempted death by <UNK> on the bed sometime yesterday evening .
they took the kids for <#> days and then spit them back out at us .
i have just come from a monstrous <UNK> of despair where i faced an evil life sucking <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> .
"not , it was not the endless <UNK> of despair of <UNK> ."
my ex had me there for the third time in <#> months to debate the great child support debate .
my income is approximately <#> seventh of what it was last year .
"yet , she and her <UNK> has asked that i be <UNK> with <UNK> <#> % higher than i made last year ."
she has asked that my child support be almost <UNK> .
in june the judge lowered it but insisted that i put in <#> job <UNK> per week .
"next month , in july , she <UNK> it plus a little bit because i was working a short call ."
she said she believed i was looking for work .
my ex said she believed i was looking for work .
"every week , <#> new people believe i am looking for work ."
( any lawyers out there wanna take a pro <UNK> case ? )
we settled on a monthly amount that i do not have .
the judge promised not the throw me in jail today for not having it .
we shall see if the monster of the <UNK> gets me or not .
ok .. here i stand with cyber egg on my face .
it seems that iraqi <UNK> al - <UNK> has decided to change his mind once again and die for his cause .
"he has been quoted as saying , ' ' either <UNK> or victory ."
""" he is now prepared once more to give his all for his <UNK> ."
"if you want to die for something you believe in , by all means , die for it ."
this country ( america ) was built by men and women willing to give everything for the very idea of dying free .
"when you got close , they said , "" i was just kidding ."
not to mention that fact that all the <UNK> around is hard on the ankles .
are you going to die for your cause or not ?
make up your mind before we make it up for you .
"ok .. a public official that says he will do <#> thing to <UNK> a measured response and then when time comes to pony up , he <UNK> ."
this guy has a great future with the bush administration .
it is just after 9:30 am and the pressure is rising .
"no , not the <UNK> pressure ( well , it may be rising , but it is nt what i am talking about ) ."
"<UNK> going off , demanding that we get out of bed and do the responsible thing and send the kids off to school ."
it was slap slap and <#> more minutes of <UNK> .
"so , we get up , get the kids up , and begin the day ."
she is having an assessment done on her wrist to determine the <UNK> <UNK> for workers comp ( she was injured at work by a client ) .
she is taking kyle to school and <UNK> is going with her to the dr .
i am taking chelsea to school and chris to work .
we are out the door at approximately <UNK> am .
<UNK> has to be at school no later than 8:30 .
chris and i swing back around the circle and head to <UNK> 's pizza .
"as we are driving past the house and approaching the stop sign just half a block from home , it happens ."
"the radio is on <#> fm , the bull ."
i can hear her <UNK> on like faint background noise when she <UNK> up her report .
"she says , and i quote , "" have a good rest of the day ."
"now i have to worry that my day , or the rest of it , will not be good ."
she could have taken it easy on us and told us to have a ' good rest of the morning ' .
the rest of the morning was only a few hours .
she felt compelled to make it the ' rest of the day ' .
who teaches these people to apply this kind of pressure .
this time i will be researching my memory to be able to assure myself that the ' rest of my day ' yesterday was good .
"<UNK> is off being tortured , so there is no <UNK> and loving ."
the day is going downhill and i am still under the gun to have a good rest of the day .
why did i have to choose to listen the the radio ?
there are many cd 's in the truck that would never dream of applying this kind of pressure on me .
i could have had it off and been enjoying quiet quality conversation with chris .
"not about <UNK> stuff like saving the world , protecting the <UNK> , or whether <UNK> spears is truly happy ."
it was just supposed to be back ground noise .
"all of them , turning the <UNK> , applying the pressure ."
". have a good rest of the day , bastard ."
i am so sick of all the political ads <UNK> every air wave of every medium .
there has to be some place where a citizen can go where they will not be <UNK> with <UNK> propaganda .
"when you are feeling overwhelmed by your morning commute , you can rush to <#> of these political free <UNK> ."
they will replace the small smoking sections outside of restaurants .
"in every bathroom in an office building , there should be a <UNK> stall ."
"can we write in "" no - <#> "" ?"
"i have been reading the news of the world , the <#> outside of my door ."
it seems that iraqi <UNK> al - <UNK> in <UNK> has decided that fighting unto death is no longer a good idea .
"once troops got close enough to actually carry out his wishes , he decided that he needed to sign a peace <UNK> ."
"in the terms of this <UNK> , he will remove and turn over the <UNK> hiding in the <UNK> ."
"not only is he <UNK> , but he is turning over those under his command or protection ."
what happened to the day when a person <UNK> to fight til death and did it .
""" i will win or get close to death trying "" just does n't have the same <UNK> ring , does it ?"
""" i will <UNK> you until you almost beat me up . """
""" you wo nt get my lunch money .. unless you threaten me a whole lot . """
kids playing in a grown up world with grown up toys .
it is time to meet the rest of the gang . living with us at the house
"the oldest of these is the boss of the house , dude ."
he was born at my old place and has been with me since his birth ( mostly ) .
"i came home from work <#> day to a <UNK> <UNK> of kittens , a gift from bob , their mom ."
"later , the kids came home from a trip with a friend to see him race , with a solid black <UNK> - ball ."
"about <#> months later , <UNK> 's balls dropped and shortly <UNK> bob was pregnant ."
do n't ask me to determine your cat 's sex .
i gave most of them away and gave bob away as well .
<UNK> decided he did n't want to hang around anymore .
"as i was giving the kittens away , <#> of them would <UNK> disappear anytime someone came to pick <#> up ."
well .. as you might suspect .. he was n't a her .. and i was not going to have a male cat named ' <UNK> ' .
"about <#> months ago , dude decided to leave ."
he hung around the house but would run whenever anyone approached him .
"then just as suddenly as he left , he appeared on the porch seeking entry ."
he walked in as if he had never left .
that small change was a <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> .
<UNK> ( who gave us this gay dog ) told us he was house broken .
"let me tell ya , always suspect this statement from anyone trying to give you a dog ."
he is scared of everything in the house except <UNK> .
"every noise causes him to jump , run , and hide ."
"every now and then , he will come to me and stand by my leg looking for attention ."
"he takes to training quite well , but walks into doors and walls ."
"we have only had him for about <#> months , but he is already a member of the family ."
"he tries to sleep in it from time to time , but that does n't work with his size , his nails , and our <UNK> ."
"he would never hurt them , except by accident ."
<UNK> was born in may of <#> as well .
she is about <#> to <#> inches long now .
"she is friendly , but her once a week feeding of a live mouse reminds you that she is first and foremost , a predator ."
she love wrapping herself around <UNK> 's wrist in what <UNK> calls a snake - let .
she is growing and getting stronger all the time .
her growth will be controlled by her cage size .
"right now , she has much room to grow ."
"temporarily , chris has a white rat , <UNK> ."
"he has it in the room , but there is n't room in there for the cage , and the other room <UNK> does not like it at all ."
there will be discussion when he comes home today as to what we are going to do about this .
there is no other place in the house to keep <UNK> .
the kids have returned from their fast <UNK> first day at school .
kyle gets out at <UNK> at <#> of the worst traffic <UNK> schools in town .
you are not allowed to park in front of the school to wait for your child .
the problem with this is that the kids come out at the other end of the school .
it was a source of constant fun last year when i would go to pick up kyle .
i would ' stop ' in front of the school .
they would come out to tell me that i could not park there .
"i would ( politely , of course ) explain to them that i was not parked , as my truck was still running and i was still inside it ."
this is known as stopping and not posted as an illegal activity .
they would tell me that the police would write me a ticket .
i would be the <#> to pay it and that too would be no skin off of their backs .
they have decided that it is a waste of time to tell ( threaten ) us anymore .
chelsea gets out of school at <UNK> at a school with just a slightly better <UNK> situation .
we meet chelsea about a half a block from the school on the major street the school shares a corner with .
"it is just a parking bad dream , not a full <UNK> nightmare ."
"in the middle of those <UNK> , <UNK> had to pick <UNK> up from work ."
"her boss has scheduled her for starting at noon , several days this week ."
it has been explained to him that this has to be an only time deal .
her work <UNK> not interfere with her education .
he has limited friend interaction here at the house .
most of his interaction is with friends of the older kids that visit .
"while kyle is sometimes <UNK> than these visitors , he still needs friends of his own age to play with ."
"chelsea spent the day in the library or cafeteria , as the school has not gotten her schedule finished yet ."
<UNK> is <UNK> with jordan ( her boyfriend ) about being invisible .
"here it is , the first day of <UNK> ."
it is more commonly known by parents and children alike as the first day of school .
it has been a long and eventful summer around here .
it began on the last day of school for kyle .
"<UNK> , <UNK> 's ex , was here to pick up the kids for his month <UNK> during the summer ."
a day later they were all headed to florida and the house got <UNK> quiet .
"it was a creepy feeling , but <#> that rapidly turned to silent <UNK> ."
"do n't get me wrong , i love kids ."
"still , there needs to be times when , for extended periods of time , adults can be alone ."
"the month passed quickly , as they often do ."
"before we knew it , it was the fourth of july and time to go to florida to pick up the kids ."
<UNK> went while i worked <#> and <#> hours days here .
"the following month and a half of summer , the kids were here ."
"they are not bad kids , they are not good kids , they are just kids ."
"during the summer , they tend to stay up all night and sleep most of the day ."
they live a life without structure for that time .
"any time , day or night , at least <#> of them is sleeping and at least <#> of them is awake ."
"then , add to this the coming and going of friends in <UNK> numbers ."
<#> weeks ago the summer took a <UNK> sad turn .
<#> friends of the kids were involved in a shooting .
"<#> shot the other , then shot himself , as far as anyone knows ."
"david and tommy were arguing when david shot tommy , then turned the gun on himself ."
"while the kids knew both boys , they were much closer to tommy ."
<UNK> took him in like she does all the other stray kids .
"like most , he called her ' moms ' ."
kyle is <#> and starting 3rd grade this morning .
"he was so excited to be back at school , he almost did n't wait for the car to stop before he was trying to get out the door ."
she too is excited about going back to school .
"perhaps not so much that she would jump from a moving car , but excited none the less ."
"she has <UNK> , odd , and is bi - <UNK> ."
public schools around here are just not able to teach her .
their idea of handling her was to put her in the back of the classroom and ignore her .
"last year , we <UNK> her with great success ."
"with <UNK> , the keys are to keep her on task and limit her frustrations by taking the time to explain and teach her ."
chris is <#> and trying to get his <UNK> .
he can pass it all except for a part of the math .
he figures the answer quickly enough that he does n't need to estimate .
then he tries to guess what the estimate should be by taking the number closest to his answer .
he begins his new job at <UNK> 's pizza on wednesday . back to the <UNK> reason . in my humble opinion
the house being empty for afternoon sex is good as well .
i 'll let ya know how their day went when i get the reports back .
"i do n't know if anyone is reading this or not , but that is not important ( a lie ) ."
"you know , the important thing is that i get my feelings and words out of my head ( ok , almost a lie ) ."
"since this is the first post here , i will allow y'all a brief glimpse into my head ."
it might be like trying to swim in the shallow end of the pool .
i am not sure that i think on a deep level all the time .
"i might be drowning in my own thoughts , but that does n't necessarily mean they are deep ."
right about now my deepest thoughts are how i begin a new paragraph . '
"my sister , now approaching <#> , skipped school once while she was in high school ."
she went with some friends to <UNK> ' beach ' .
"ok , in kentucky , we do n't have real beaches , but we call this sandy spot on the side of the kentucky river a beach ."
"anyway , she was enjoying her day away from school , <UNK> around in the water , when she fell ."
"she came up , <UNK> , and down she went again . once more"
", she broke the surface , <UNK> for air and dropped into the <UNK> deep ."
she was drowning ( a curse from god for her sin of skipping school ) .
"she was going down for the last time when a kindly gentleman walked over to where she was dying , and told her to stand up ."
she was drowning in water that was knee deep .
that could be the case in my head and in my thoughts .
my drowning in them and the depth of them are not necessarily related .
"this is not to say that these things are not important to someone on some level , just not blog material , or so i think ."
"oh yeah , and i figured out the new paragraph thing ."
"so , lets go for a ride in my head ."
the basis for much of my thinking will <UNK> from my <UNK> and <UNK> .
my father was a church pastor from the time i was <#> years old until a few years ago .
"i do have the brief stops at <#> , <#> , and <#> to go ."
"dad was <UNK> in germany during the korean conflict , where they met , fell madly in love and were married ."
they have been married just over <#> years now .
i got married at <#> after dropping out of college .
i joined the international <UNK> of electrical workers and began my <UNK> a month before the wedding .
my pay dramatically increased from $ <#> to $ <#> per hour .
"around <#> , i ' accepted ' the call to preach and began working in the church <UNK> by my father ."
"my father worked as an <UNK> and <UNK> the church as well . until he was in his <#> 's , he never accepted any salary from the church ."
"what is interesting is , when i was a boy , dad would ask me what i wanted to be when i grew up ."
"my answers <UNK> , but the <#> thing that remained constant was that there were <#> things i never wanted to be ."
how funny life is can only be topped by how funny life is .
"<#> years , <#> beautiful daughters , and miles of water under the bridge , after <UNK> and i were married , we divorced ."
<#> of them are married and have children of their own .
now is when i learn if those <UNK> skills ( or lack thereof ) actually worked .
"<UNK> <UNK> , divorced , and <UNK> again since then ."
"about <#> months ago i met <UNK> , a beautiful lady who eventually ( <UNK> <#> ) became my wife ."
"she and i , and her <#> children make our home in <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"later we might venture into deeper waters , but for today , i think i will retreat to the safety of my cozy beach towel in the warm sand ."
try not to block my sunlight while ya read .
"for my kids football game at <#> ..... jon , my middle son , brought his <UNK> so of course she spent the entire day w/ us ..."
"well , rita took <UNK> ( sons <UNK> ) home at <#> pm and was back at the house about <UNK> ..."
"i was on the front porch having a cigarette ... she basically stepped around me and said "" well , i 'm going to <UNK> ..."
i asked if she could spare time to talk and she <UNK> said yes ...
<UNK> it takes a <UNK> headache and hours of begging for that ! )
how do i get myself in shit like this !
"do n't know exactly what i 'm gonna say yet , but when i do , i will post something here ...."
<UNK> i still do n't have the nerve to reply <UNK> ...
... gonna sit rita down and talk ... open up and tell her everything ! <UNK>
"gonna mention any names , but i ca n't keep lying and hiding ..."
"well , i just spent about the last <#> minutes "" chatting "" to sue on yahoo"
... she sounds about as confused and frustrated as i do ( w/ good <UNK> ...
i really fucked up ... but at least i got to talk to her <UNK> and ask alot of questions
"... she basically <UNK> everything up in <#> statement "" its caused by being in love with the right person at the wrong time "" ..."
i even gave this url to see what i have been going thru for the last week ...
i kinda hope she does read it and then again kinda hope she does n't ...
the way things used to be ... she was ( and still is ) everything to me ...
there is n't a moment during the day that i do n't think of her ...
"oh well , lemme go do something and try to get my mind off this "" <UNK> hope to post more later sue 's profile pic urllink"
"i was really excited about my non - drinking , and thought that she would at least be happy for me , but no ... fuck it ...."
"<UNK> everything from my yahoo profile and will now just use "" blog "" to express myself"
"well , sue and i have been kinda chatting on yahoo tonight , but you can sense the tension ..."
i said that i was alcohol free still and she freaked out on me ... said she was tired of me <UNK> her ....
july 12th was my last drink ... i swear !
"<UNK> i am focusing on the wrong "" <UNK> ... lemme try and look at what i do have on the other side ..."
"<UNK> ... rita is very "" cold "" ... not very personal or <UNK> pretty much drives me crazy"
... it 's long and <UNK> and so soft to the touch ...
the only reason that i can find in my twisted warped little mind to stay w/ rita is the kids ...
i am her sun and her moon ... night and her day ...
i ca n't have my little girl growing up thinking i am a <UNK>
"oh well , gotta go for now ... more later"
"bob , i thought all day and night about the e - mails ."
i do love you bob and i know you feel the same for me but
we can talk whenever ya want as much as you want .
give me time to work up to that please .
but you are my friend for life and i wo nt shut you out .
i m sorry it has to end up this way babe but i wo nt set myself up for hurt and <UNK> anymore .
urllink i was telling you about <UNK> smile ? ? ?
okay - it was my first day at work at my new position at <UNK> .
"it was a long <#> , but the bus ride to and from the city made it lower stress than fighting the traffic on the nj <UNK> ."
no time tonight to write more - gotta go .
- so i have officially made the move to home depot to outline what i am going to have to do to paint the apartment .
"it is pretty apparent that i am not going to get much <UNK> from my roommate , even though he and his former roommate completely screwed it up ."
"they had a <UNK> idea , and a shitty plan from what i understand ."
"i also want to have the couch steam cleaned , and i wonder what a cover will do for it ? ? ?"
i live on long island and work in manhattan .
"since i 'm not a total <UNK> , i choose to avoid driving into manhattan ."
"so i take the long island rail road , perhaps the world 's most <UNK> mode of transportation ."
i pay over $ <#> per month for a rail road and subway pass .
and there is talk that they are considering raising the fare on both the rail road and subway .
"regardless , a <#> % hike is pretty tough to bear ."
"and i live in the closest "" fare zone "" on long island ."
"there are people who live further out that actually pay more than i do , believe it or not ."
i have a history of <UNK> with the <UNK> . as you can probably guess
the vast majority of the trains that the rail road used up until about last year were <#> - <#> years old .
"they recently began purchasing and putting into service new cars , which are quite nice , truth be told ."
"since they have to <UNK> to the americans with <UNK> act , there are more spaces for <UNK> and much larger ( yay ) bathrooms ."
now these brand new trains with their <UNK> bathrooms have had problems .
most bathrooms are closed on the trains because the toilets get backed up quite easily .
"today , my train home from work had door problems <#> stop away from my stop ."
at first the train workers tried to fix the problem .
"then they told those of us in the last <#> cars to walk up and get back into the train further up , which we did , <UNK> ."
"they told us to wait for the next train scheduled to stop at the station , which would be in another <#> minutes ."
so the several <#> of us were supposed to squeeze into what was likely an already crowded train .
i am very much not looking forward to what will happen on both the rail road and the nyc subway during the republican convention .
"but i 'll be sure to write about it , so if you have any interest , check back in a couple of weeks ."
"have n't even read too many of them either , but do n't hold that against me ."
what i 'm not at a loss for is an opinion .
"my political <UNK> are to the left , but not so far left that i would consider voting for ralph nader ."
"and , in my opinion ( see , here i go ) , neither should you ."
but what i do respect is your right to vote for mr .
just know what it is you might end up with if you do .
"well , here 's what i read : <UNK> fair , wired , business week , and time ."
i also read entertainment weekly from time to time .
"i also check out the web quite a bit - urllink new york daily news , urllink <UNK> and other random sites that i might run across ."
"oh , and let 's not forget the radio ."
i 'm an avid urllink air america radio listener .
"i do n't have anything of much value to add tonight ( sunday , <#> ) , but i hope to have something up shortly ."
i 'm trying to catch up on some of my magazine reading .
"i recently finished reading al <UNK> 's book , lies , and the lying <UNK> who tell them , and richard <UNK> 's book , against all enemies ."
"al 's book is a pretty quick read , which both made me laugh and made me angry ."
"richard <UNK> 's book was a slower , dryer read , but well worth the effort ."
"at some point i 'll probably pick up the <#> report , after i catch up on my magazine reading . off"
"have you ever noticed that when you do n't get enough sleep , you can be very <UNK> but also very sensitive to the world around you ?"
"and although you can over - react and not really be yourself , so to speak , it 's not necessarily a bad thing ."
"for the past <#> nights , i have gotten very little sleep , like <#> hrs ."
"( note : with kids , they never really sleep thru the night ."
"you 're exhausted everyday till they 're <#> , and even then ... )"
"my point though is when i get this way , i definitely get <UNK> , but i also become <UNK> aware of how i 'm feeling . and"
"for me , growing up in an alcoholic home and trained to not show any emotion , it can be extremely intense ."
"today , the feeling is <UNK> -- absolute , i'm - totally - in - shock , never - saw - this - coming <UNK> . and"
"of course , it 's another christian , another <UNK> , a fellow believer in christ who i am experiencing this with ."
"i ca n't stop thinking about it , dwelling on it , dreaming of revenge ..."
"i always want that last final <UNK> where i chew the person up , spit them out , and <UNK> them ."
"it plays over and over again in my mind -- my words become quicker , <UNK> , <UNK> everytime i have my imaginary final battle ."
nor do i think that 's how the lord wants it to be . in your struggle against sin
", you have not yet <UNK> to the point of <UNK> blood , <UNK> <UNK> now , there 's the rub ."
my anxiety is still nothing in comparison to the cross and <UNK> <UNK> and seeking <UNK> is the same as if doing it .
the struggle then comes in releasing my <UNK> and blessing them .
"i then must cry out , "" father , forgive me and thank you . """
that he is so much bigger than any church . thank god ! that he is so much greater than petty jealousy
that his love for me and for you is <UNK> .
that his mercy is faithful to meet every prayer . thank god ! that this is n't and will never be how the story ends .
i went shopping today for my oldest who is starting kindergarten .
i of course started to cry in the dressing room as she tried on her navy <UNK> and white - peter - pan - <UNK> shirt .
<UNK> of my first years of elementary school when i wore exactly the same thing .
sending her to school was a difficult decision for me .
"frankly , my super <#> <UNK> is total boy and anything "" school - like "" is a bit challenging for him ( so to speak ) ."
"he , on the other hand , may still be <UNK> ."
i think i 'll get a better sense of that once grace is gone .
i did n't sleep much at all last night . much like any other night
", i lay awake in bed trying to make sense of my life ."
sometimes i feel like i outside of my body watching my very own life take place .
i feel as if god is <UNK> the missing pieces in front of me and i can not grasp them .
it is like he is showing me the way but i can not get there from here .
"last night while i was lying in bed trying to go to sleep , i kept going over the things that have happened to me during my life ."
of course i accomplished nothing except achieving a new level of sleep <UNK> .
"i am quite good at that , i think if i were in the olympics i would win the gold in the sleep <UNK> category ."
"is it something you actually learn to do , or do you just achieve some kind of inner peace ?"
how do you learn to love someone that apparently nobody else likes ?
i have been a failure at most everything i have tried .
"if other people can not see the good in me , how am i supposed to see it ?"
"they are on the outside looking in , i am on the inside looking out ."
although sometimes i do feel as if i am the <#> on the outside looking in .
<#> would think that during those long and endless nights when i can not sleep that i could find the answers to some of these questions .
but those long nights lying awake in my bed just lead me to more and more questions .
questions that run so deep that i have no clue where to look for the answers .
so for now i am standing in the middle of an empty room .
i am holding in my hand the <#> piece of the puzzle that i may have figured out .
"the piece of puzzle that says "" we all need <UNK> love , but first you have to find that kind of love within yourself . """
that particular piece of the puzzle is very odd shaped as most puzzle pieces are .
i have also noticed that it is quite heavy and i can not make out the <UNK> or any kind of pattern on that piece of puzzle .
"i have no idea what to do with it , where to put it ."
this was her second appearance on the oprah show to discuss her issues with her weight .
i can not begin to explain how she touched my heart that day .
"had it not been for the fact that she is famous , i would have sworn we were <#> in the same ."
"she said things that made <UNK> and <UNK> go off in my head , i swear ."
"things that i had never admitted to myself , things that were hiding deep inside my heart ."
"if i have ever had an <UNK> , i had <#> that day ."
i just wish my husband had n't been sitting beside me while i was watching it .
i had to actually guard my reaction because if i had let myself react the way i had wanted to he would have thought i was a complete <UNK> .
"talk about hitting the nail on the head , if i had not known better i would have looked for a hidden camera during the show ."
"i swear she was in my head and in my heart , speaking my deepest darkest emotions and fears ."
"at <#> point i just knew oprah was going to knock on my door and say something like "" this is your life ! "" ."
"the <UNK> thing of all is that the <UNK> family is from <UNK> , <UNK> and i live about <#> minutes from there ."
the <#> thing that struck me the most was her comment that we were all looking for <UNK> love .
that was <#> thing we all needed and deserved .
"oh my gosh , it was almost like "" ding ding ding "" !"
the bells and <UNK> were going off in my head .
"i had never admitted it before , but that 's what i want ."
maybe that is why i want a child so badly .
"i want someone to love me <UNK> , and i do n't have that now , nor have i ever had it ."
"do n't get me wrong , my husband loves me and i have no doubts about that ."
but even a husband has conditions on his love .
"i am sure there are things i could do that would change how my husband feels about me , so it is n't really <UNK> ."
i used to think that a mother 's love was <UNK> .
my mother is very <UNK> and tends to make me feel as if i do n't live up to her standards .
"i know i am a huge disappointment to both of my parents , but that is something i have begun to learn to deal with recently ."
<UNK> did say that we have to love ourselves <UNK> and once we do we will be so much more satisfied .
"i guess that is what i need to do , learn to love myself ."
"i realized while listening to <UNK> talk , that i do like myself , but i do n't really love myself ."
so i guess i have a starting point .
i am holding the first piece of the puzzle in my hand .
now all i have to do is figure out where to put it .
i often wonder if life is nothing more than random <UNK> .
lately i am starting to wonder if life is random .
my family always told me i think about things too much .
in that respect i take after my dad . as a child
"i always thought of dad as "" the <UNK> "" ."
"when confronted with a problem , my dad did n't always have an immediate answer ."
"sometimes a day or so later , when you were sure he had already forgotten about it , he would present a solution ."
a solution that he had apparently been working out in his mind the entire time .
"so even when life is "" happening "" , and i am going about my daily routine , i am thinking about any number of life 's mysteries ."
there are so many aspects of life that make no sense .
i want to know why it happened the way it did .
"i recently have started questioning this , so i am still struggling to figure this <#> out ."
"i am constantly wondering if life is "" fair and just "" ."
i have never been <#> to compare my life to the lives of others .
there never seemed to be a reason to before now .
"now i spend many hours wondering why i have to struggle with so many issues , and all at the same time ."
why it seems like the harder i try the worse it gets .
but most of all i wonder why my life seems like a huge <UNK> puzzle with so many missing pieces .
i feel like i am looking at an algebra equation .
an equation that i just can not figure out !
i wonder how different my life would have been if i had made other choices in my earlier years .
"the <#> thing i ca n't imagine changing in my life is my husband , so many other choices i wish i could change , but not that <#> ."
"i am so very happily married , that is the <#> true blessing in my life ."
"if it were not for my husband and his strength which i draw from , i am sure i would have given up a long time ago ."
i am lucky to have him by my side .
sometimes i wonder if over the years maybe i have created my own little world ( in my mind ) .
"my expectations of myself are extremely high , as are my expectations of others ."
"i strive to live my daily life in a "" do unto others "" mode ."
"i treat people how i would like to be treated , following the rules i mentioned above ."
but usually living by those rules limits my world to a population of <#> .
maybe my world ( the <#> in my mind ) is completely fantasy and there is no possible way it could ever be anything more .
but i would like to think that i am not the only person who <UNK> to be a better person on a daily basis .
"i 'm not quite sure what possessed me to want to blog , but here i am ."
i think in part it is my passion for writing that makes blogging appealing to me .
but i 'm sure that my need to express my inner thoughts is ultimately why i am here .
i need a space that can be all about me .
it is about time i became a little selfish .
this is <#> place that will be <#> % completely about me .
no worries that someone will think ill of me .
"although at times it seems as if noone cares , i need to care about me whether anybody else does or not ."
"in an attempt to <UNK> the essence of her youth , she posed for some very extreme nude photos ."
she had not thought about how this would effect the community she lives in or the children whose lives she was in a position to alter for the good .
the town was completely up in arms over the pictures when they got out .
"i watched "" oprah , after the show "" the other day ."
"she was trying , through a storm of tears , to explain how it all made her feel ."
it is always nice when someone puts their self out there for you to talk about so you can take the focus off of yourself for a while .
"ah , the <UNK> hearts are always ripe to jump into action ."
this woman appeared to be having a bit of a nervous breakdown on national television ( nervous <UNK> which i strongly recommend - go ahead and cry honey ) .
oprah did not <UNK> to the woman but what she said was real and it was the truth and it rang so <UNK> in my heart .
the lord saw this and delivered her through a situation that was entirely the result of her not <UNK> her own power .
"now that it is all said and done , she realizes what she had and she now sees who she is is a very significant instrument of god ."
"oprah added that once you see the lesson that you were suppose to learn , it is over and that is what "" grace "" is ."
i look back at decisions i have made since <#> and i struggle to try to realize why i made some of the decisions i made .
i was not thinking about my own ability to affect others lives .
the lord saw this and he accompanied me through my mistakes and brought me through it to the other side .
"if i only learned this <#> thing from it all , i have perhaps learned the most valuable lesson of my life ."
i woke up with a bad taste in my mouth .
he fell on the floor and was lying there on his back .
i <UNK> to go lift him off the floor and i did not realize until i had him back in his chair that i was completely naked .
then i woke up and i am now thinking about a number of things .
""" thank god it was only a dream ! """
there are different kinds of blogs you could have and you can have several at the same time or you could just have <#> .
everyone has things about themselves that they do not want everyone to know -- maybe something that happened in the past .
"however , the lord dealt with you and delivered you out of your <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> ways ."
"now , you are free of the <UNK> of pseudo - <UNK> ."
i think i have been awake far too long .
how will you ever be able to face the world ?
how much of your self must you reveal in a blog in order to maintain its integrity as a genuine and complete representation of who you are ?
are there not instances in which it is not what you do say but what you do n't say that is <UNK> ?
the appointment with <UNK> was <UNK> until next week .
so after the morning meeting i had some time over to put up posters with the bicycle trailer - anyone interested ?
"conclusion on the "" selling "" of the <UNK> book : author first , me next ."
contact with <UNK> writer interesting by the way and preparation of <UNK> and calling 2nd <UNK> nl - da started .
"well excuse me , but is n't there a problem with intellectual property right and/or copyright here ?"
- i mean the article does spell out <UNK> name in the <UNK> beginning but nowhere <UNK> or even <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> cook <UNK> are mentioned .
for once the evening news brought information that was personally relevant to me !
:-) the interview with <UNK> <UNK> from the urllink world literature days on <UNK> was great .
oh so true that what south africa has tried to overcome and cure the past years is exactly what pops up in the rest of the world right now .
i only hope that he 's right about the necessity of this in order to be able to spot the problems and address them properly . and
then the urllink <UNK> ladies won ol bronze today !
and of course it 's not as great as silver but what the ... ;-) - when will i go sailing again ?
"well , at least <UNK> is within reach by now :-)"
starting on the translation of the 1st <UNK> <UNK> tonight ! is n't it just exciting ? :-) )
"my mother went to <UNK> this morning and is going to stay there for the weekend , living in a hotel nearby <UNK> <UNK> ."
i wish it was me - doing field studies there .
this blogger.com thing already starts annoying me - the possibilities for editing etc do not <UNK> my needs .
: how do you make links in comments on other <UNK> such as urllink click here ? !
- prefer <UNK> ( which is <UNK> hour ) to <UNK> !
"in my case however , it 's not the <UNK> turning to me in order to have me do a translation for them of a book of their <UNK> ."
"i hope , i can get to do the test translation on grounds of this great initiative :-) ."
of course i 'm not going to let this chance to see my beloved <UNK> again slip away and am going to sign up for this event as well .
and now i 've received this mail - saying that he would like me to become his agent ... something new to think about ...
( <UNK> <UNK> der <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> ... )
try and sell my self as an experienced and gifted <UNK> ...
translate the whole first chapter and some of the <UNK> reviews and then ... ?
your bitter words so <UNK> <UNK> like biting into lemon <UNK>
"urllink <UNK> writes well , will you look at that ?"
"i can "" blog this "" with my own blog ."
i had a really hard time with the <UNK> and point of view .
i know it is confusing because of the <UNK> .
but it did n't work in first or third person .
this is not the <UNK> and i 'm no jay <UNK> .
"if anyone has a suggestion as to how to ease the <UNK> , or if that is even necessary , i 'm open to it ."
"and when i do , i do n't care so much if it is good or it is bad , or if it does n't follow the "" rules ."
""" my poems are very personal -- a way to get some emotion or idea out onto the page quickly ."
"often , they stem from ideas that are too limited for a short story ."
"he says , it is like you <#> are in a pool and the water is emotion ."
"you ( he <UNK> at you ) are up to your neck , saying please come in ."
"you ( he <UNK> at him ) are outside the pool , saying please get out ."
"after , you have coffee , and share a cookie . and agree you liked the analogy ."
"and he says , i like how he said you ( he <UNK> at you ) have gone off the deep end ."
"the sound of adult voices downstairs , urgent and <UNK> , drawing me from my dream world ."
"<UNK> <UNK> the stairs on the second floor landing , looking down through the <UNK> posts at my mother and my uncle victor in the hall below ."
"my mother ’s voice , questioning , uncertain : “"
"i want to say something , want to speak out ."
a quick note : my other urllink blog is more urllink blog - like .
urllink urllink i threw my back out last week .
the dog could not figure out what the hell i was doing on the floor .
i wanted to comment on katie and bob ’s lame comments during the opening <UNK> of the olympics . but urllink this blogger
"check out her other site , urllink <UNK> is a pony ."
"it is hysterical , although i have no idea why ."
"<UNK> is registered on urllink amazon , by the way ."
"and yes , from what i gather , <UNK> is a pony ."
urllink urllink this picture is from the back of a bag of children ’s cereal .
"that ’s right , i eat kid ’s cereal ."
"and yes , sometimes i eat the cheap kind that comes in a bag ."
"ok , sometimes a <UNK> is just a <UNK> ."
"and if it is , it is not digging for gold . or if it is , it is not digging for that kind of gold ."
"on the bag , the <UNK> is described as “ orange ."
” the actual piece is more flesh - colored . and
"do n't even get me started on the pink <UNK> or the red treasure chest . """
urllink urllink this is the cover of my book about <UNK> <UNK> .
most authors don’t get to choose or even comment on the cover artwork for their books . if anyone had asked me
", i would have said that <UNK> warriors fought naked ."
these <#> fully dressed men are probably fighting over the holy <UNK> .
"because , you know , ancient <UNK> is all about jesus ."
"it 's still a good book , though ."
urllink urllink this is a picture of my mom and dad reading the dedication of urllink my book for the first time .
"hey , at least i did n't publish the <#> of her crying ! yet ."
been cutting back on <UNK> . causing serious <UNK> .
i seem to be doing ok with it so maybe <UNK> is <UNK> up a bit .
i know it 's still early but i hope to be able to find it someday soon .
<UNK> sees the power men down the street and decides to have a chat with them .
oh well it was a nice gesture right ... more like a <UNK> to me .
:) ate <#> hot dogs from <#> - <#> for lunch .
i do not know why i <UNK> myself the way i do .
i knew before i ate them it was going to hurt .
been real sick to my stomach again the past couple of days .
<UNK> 's staying at a friends house tonight ( <UNK> ) and i guess it 's another night at the parents for <UNK> and i.
well the storm has passed but the <UNK> it left behind is everywhere .
huge <UNK> the size of houses are <UNK> over like toys .
that storm was nothing like i have ever seen before .
it was beautiful and scary at the same time .
on a more positive note the pregnancy is going along just fine .
she is the doc that did my <UNK> after the <UNK> .
i 'm not as nervous as i was in the beginning . still have to take meds or <UNK> hits .
i have already gained a couple of pounds due to all the carbs i 've been eating .
hope doc does n't get on to me about that .
bill and <UNK> took water and supplies to robert and family ( <UNK> ) .
they lost all their <UNK> off the roof and there neighborhood was hit pretty hard .
i guess they ca n't find water or ice anywhere .
we had some <UNK> left over so they drove them over .
yesterday when i was browsing i found this link .
"i ca n't even remember , i was looking for something totally different ."
<#> of the things that i can start talking about is how my life has change from last year .
"i ca n't say all the fault was his but mostly yes , he cheated on me ."
now i need to look forward and try not to think about ...
"i did everything possible to save my marriage , because i have a little <UNK> and i wanted her to have a family ... forever ."
the same way i did when i was single ( the first time ) .
i 'm so lucky to have the parents i have and the sisters i have .
now i appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy .
"( today is the birthday of <#> of my sisters , by the way )"
"so , the point is that all the <UNK> i had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life ."
"really , everything i believed before is kind of ... gone ."
"i just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone , because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the <UNK> beliefs i had ."
"sometimes i think if i will be able to trust again , you know as a partner and find someone that i can count on ."
"someone to grow old and have wonderful memories , do you think is there such a person for me ?"
last night i was thinking about all the relationships i have had in my life and always end up the same way .
men cheating or maybe is me being to naive .
i like to exercise and do a lot of things with my <UNK> and her friends .
i guess most of the tv shows i know are from disney channel .
an about movies well most of the movies for kids .
i have had so many challenges in my life but <UNK> this <#> is <#> of the hardest to pass .
i 'll let you know how i 'm doing later ...
news out of iraq from brother ron : the internet cafe has finally opened here .
i have to share it with about <#> marines and soldiers though .
they are not early <UNK> so if i get here around <#> am i am good .
the <UNK> leader has finally lifted our <UNK> and we are now allowed to go out .
"not doing much work though , just getting our faces seen so that the <UNK> all know that we are still here ."
the <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> the other day whilst our <UNK> were there .
after about <#> hours the <UNK> chief got hold of our language assistant via radio and asked if the <UNK> here could help out .
"the army and marines said "" hell yes "" and all the wounded were brought here and ultimately <UNK> to <UNK> ."
<#> ip was definitely not going to make it .
each time they moved him to the side and put a guard on his body .
if he lives he will never be the same .
so we were able to watch all that was going on .
these <UNK> were the volunteers that i mentioned earlier in another e - mail .
<UNK> and laying their lives down to help get rid of that asshole .
with no internet and no tv i really have no idea what 's going on here .
i hear of cease - fires being <UNK> but then all hell breaks loose .
we have <UNK> here that <UNK> to <UNK> fire by the <UNK> .
no offensive <UNK> are being conducted by the marines here at this time .
monkey boy 's back is against the wall and he is desperately trying to save his own skin .
i wish he would bring his sorry ass out of the <UNK> and make good on his <UNK> .
we went to police <UNK> yesterday and recovered about <#> <UNK> of various sizes and some <UNK> .
some of the <UNK> and <UNK> rounds had been converted to <UNK> and then recovered by the <UNK> along the <UNK> .
the <UNK> guys did not want to bring the <UNK> and <UNK> to the base so we went down the street from the <UNK> and lit them off .
the marines and <UNK> unit were out the other night on patrol and asked for <UNK> rounds from the <UNK> here .
they raised the <UNK> of the guns higher than the fence <UNK> them form the camp and let loose .
the <UNK> blast went over the fence and <UNK> the hell out of our <UNK> .
i got out of bed and checked with the <UNK> on duty .
they all thought that they were in coming until they saw the <UNK> in the distance .
now that we are able to go out we have learned that they have closed the <UNK> laundry at <UNK> baker .
i have been doing all of my laundry by hand and will have to continue to do so til they move the laundry over here .
ron beer is god 's way of showing us that he loves us and wants us to be happy
well .... we made it back long drive ( especially coming back ) .
we made it to <UNK> before we had to <UNK> .
found a nice gas <UNK> mart and took out a small loan to fill up the car .
we had seen several signs for the mad greek restaurant .
"so , temptation got the better of us and we <UNK> there for lunch ."
"that did the trick , we <UNK> back in the <UNK> and headed for vegas ."
"check in was fine , although they kind of screwed up our reservations ."
<UNK> pulled some <UNK> muscle and got the situation taken care of .
"we dropped of the luggage , had a couple of <UNK> in the room and wandered the casino ."
"taco <UNK> for ann and ram , <UNK> for <UNK> and fish <UNK> for me ."
"after dinner , we wandered some more and we retired up stairs ."
<UNK> was exhausted so i put on the walking shoes and headed for <UNK> 's to meet up with frank .
"after some searching , we found each other , had a couple of drinks and located the cafe so frank could eat a late meal ."
tried to get together later but we could never connect .
friday morning and early afternoon was spent <UNK> by the pool .
"after that , <UNK> and i took a stroll down the strip , tried our hands at <UNK> and headed back to the <UNK> ."
"dinner was to be at il <UNK> at new york , new york , so we <UNK> up and headed down the street ."
"after dinner , we returned to the <UNK> , <UNK> a bit and went to bed ."
saturday morning and early afternoon was again spent at the pool .
"we then <UNK> around the <UNK> , had some lunch and <UNK> some more ."
we met at <UNK> <UNK> 's for dinner and later headed to bed .
probably no posts for a few days as we have packed up the luggage and cooler and are heading to las vegas for a long weekend .
sick and tired of reading the same bad news coming out of iraq .
"if you believed everything you read or heard , this is a lost cause ."
you really have to hunt to find the positive things that are not being reported .
"lucky for me , i have a source on the ground there ."
"as mentioned in an earlier post , urllink twin brother ron is there ; <UNK> and training iraqi police officers ."
he is currently in <UNK> where that asshole al <UNK> is <UNK> in a <UNK> making impossible demands of the iraqi government and us military .
"recently , the media has reported that "" dozens "" of iraqi soldiers have deserted in support of the <UNK> ."
"more than likely , it is out of <UNK> ."
they are all local business owners who are suffering during this fighting .
another thing about the media : hurricane <UNK> just finished kicking the shit out of florida .
over a dozen <UNK> and billions of dollars in <UNK> .
president bush flew down there to survey the damage and to promise aid and support for those <UNK> by this disaster .
"of course , the media is spinning this as a political move since florida is a swing state ."
sorry w : damned if you do and damned if you do n't .
"those <UNK> do n't cut you a single break , do they ?"
"bad news for you <UNK> : if the government causes you grief , then you have a complaint ."
"but if your fan base of the general public gives you grief , that is their right ."
"if i choose to <UNK> an actor ( like susan <UNK> ) because of her political views and her <UNK> nature , that is my right as an american ."
let us take linda <UNK> for example : <UNK> from the <UNK> casino and resort for <UNK> a song to the american hero : michael moore .
"if i were a member of the audience , i would have walked out as many did ."
michael moore : i have <#> word for him : <UNK> !
"you fat , <UNK> , un - american bastard !"
"i guess the <#> commission 's report kind of took the fire our of <UNK> <#> , you half - truth telling jerk ."
"i heard the encounter you had with larry elder and your remarks about him being a <UNK> for the <UNK> party and calling him a "" house <UNK> "" ."
this remark after calling members of the <UNK> party racist .
oh the double standards applied by the liberals of this country .
"well , it looks like the troops are again rolling toward <UNK> ."
i have no problem with what they are doing .
just wish they would finish off with this little <UNK> .
seems the only time he calls a <UNK> is when he is getting his ass whipped and needs the bullets to stop flying so he can <UNK> and <UNK> .
fortunately brother ron was in vacation in thailand when the shit hit the fan and is stuck in <UNK> until there is a <UNK> in the fighting .
"getting ready to head to "" sin city "" for a few days of fun in the sun ."
not much on gambling . probably sit by the pool and have some pool drinks .
old army buddy urllink frank will be there for work related issues .
i was impressed how even animals prefer local spirits over mass market ones .
take the story of the bear who <UNK> down <#> beers of the preferred local <UNK> .
i especially enjoyed reading that they caught him with beer and <UNK> .
it just goes to show there are many different ways to show your pride .
"to quote a surf band from the <UNK> "" locals only "" <UNK>"
are you like me in that you tire easily of the same crap that nbc wants you to see at the olympics ?
", is a sport that really interests me ."
"but , alas , we only get a <UNK> here or there ."
"or , we get to see the men 's <UNK> final only because of the new wireless technology ."
why not show their stories and build up a following of a sport that was <#> of the original olympic sports ?
"with abc , espn , and all the other channels they own , what would the result be ?"
below is a link to find out what happened earlier .
"<UNK> <UNK> did n't work with <UNK> and jason , so why should this work too ?"
"i like the premise , but there needs to be an human vs. human interaction ."
i propose that they use <UNK> and <UNK> to battle it out .
hearing the olympic theme has brought back memories of a <UNK> era .
"no , i 'm not talking about the <UNK> of past great <UNK> ."
i 'm referring to an event in time that only a few of us were a part of .
it was high school band from <#> thru <#> .
we used to play the olympic theme at football games .
"<#> band members ( usually <UNK> players , why ?"
i do n't know ) would form the <UNK> rings and sway back and forth to the music .
"this display kind of just happened <UNK> of the moment , but the band director let us do this at many games ."
"usually , this was followed by the drum <UNK> featuring the band <UNK> ."
"august <#> , <#> it 's only 3:30 pm and it has been a busy busy day ."
"first of all , my niece <UNK> has left ."
she had been visiting me for the last <#> days along with her best friend amanda .
apparently the <#> of them ran into some <UNK> boys last night at the grocery store who invited them to a party .
i also <UNK> them to be home by midnight since we had to be up at dawn to trek to the airport .
as luck would have it patty called me shortly after the girls had left . when she asked for <UNK>
i casually mentioned that she was at a party and that i would have her return the call when she got back .
after a few seconds of silence patty said ok .
the girls returned home shortly before midnight full of stories of the cute guys and how nice their house was and how nice everyone was .
i <UNK> fell asleep and <UNK> until the alarm went off .
apparently the girls spent the next several hours talking to the guys on the phone ....
they <UNK> themselves at the airport by hanging on my neck and telling me that i was the best aunt .
secondly i got to work to the usual drama .
he went <UNK> into <#> woman 's office <UNK> about her <UNK> and her <UNK> of this problem .
he 's not used to people standing up to him .... especially women .
something i 'm sure comes from his indian heritage .
we all talk about how he 's very polite to men but talks down to women .
"if he ever tries to come down on me , he 's in for a nasty surprise ."
i 'm <UNK> than he is ... and i 'm usually right .
"several years ago when i was in the gun industry , my company sponsored <#> young <UNK> ."
"i 'll never be great , but i became a respectable <UNK> because of their teaching me ."
"that year ( <#> ) , kim won gold and josh won silver ."
at the time kim was the youngest american to ever win a gold medal .
she 's such a sincerely nice person and very down to earth .
the question of the evening is.. do i want to go home and collapse ?
do i want to go work out and do i want to meet some friends for a movie tonight at <#> pm .
i went to my first state fair this weekend .
"i 've walked through animal pens holding my nose , eaten <UNK> and cotton candy and ridden enough rides to make me sick ."
but there were differences between the la county fair and the missouri state fair .
"for <#> thing , the la <UNK> is much much bigger , there are more buildings , more <UNK> and fewer beer gardens ."
i 've never seen so many <UNK> <UNK> and bad <UNK> being covered by a variety of cowboy hats and <UNK> .
i could n't believe how many of them smoked .
"being from california , peer pressure has made smoking a bad thing ."
<UNK> hide their addiction at home because it 's not <UNK> in public buildings .
"in missouri however , young men and women walk around with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths <UNK> james dean ."
they take their <UNK> much more serious here in missouri .
girls had submitted their homemade prom dresses for judging .
"i ca n't remember even knowing anyone in <UNK> when i was in school , much less knowing anyone who had made their own formal ."
a couple of the dresses were well made and showed a nice sense of style .
my niece ( <UNK> ) is visiting me from <UNK> .
she just graduated from high school and therefore just had her senior prom just a few months ago .
"patty , her mother was drawn to a princess style dress ."
something <UNK> and <UNK> that would have been in style during her own prom years .
"a fight <UNK> and the tears , <UNK> and yelling intimidated all but the most <UNK> of sales people ."
<UNK> <UNK> to calling me to <UNK> from several states away .
"they ended up settling on a 3rd dress that was princess like , but was still <UNK> and still guaranteed to cause <UNK> 's to her male following ."
"several <#> dollars and a shopping spree later , poor <UNK> <UNK> to never speak to either of them again ."
"<UNK> broke the <UNK> by offering to pay for the dress herself , but only if she liked it ."
patty is a <UNK> so she <UNK> immediately and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 's sense of style .
<UNK> called jeff her ever patient husband and told him to not open the credit card bill when it came in if he did n't want heart <UNK> .
so i <UNK> had previously volunteered to send $ <#> to help towards the cost of the dress and the pictures .
"now that i 've <UNK> on , getting completely away from my subject which was the state fair ."
i just could n't imagine <UNK> sewing her own dress for something as important as the prom .
"actually , i ca n't imagine <UNK> sewing period ."
her future dreams include being an <UNK> woman on a major news show with an incredible clothing <UNK> and being able to shop in manhattan .
"<UNK> is an incredibly beautiful , <UNK> , <UNK> california girl with the common sense of a <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ."
the profile page said you could write as much as you wanted but then it said you can only have <#> characters .
i only wanted to write about who i was and where i 've lived to bring out some <UNK> with anyone who may read this stuff .
"i did n't get along at all with my step - father , but i went back to la ."
after high school because i could get into a <#> year degree program at <UNK> .
( do not work for <UNK> - bunch of <UNK> <UNK> ) .
lived there for <#> years then we packed up and moved to <UNK> where we 've been since and i 'm really glad we did .
; my second son is <UNK> and he 's <#> with a temper bigger than mine i think .
i decided that a blog might be a good way to get things off my mind and write which i have n't done since college .
i was sent a link to the following blog and was so completely impressed by what he was doing that i thought i 'd try it myself .
"( <UNK> - in - <UNK> ) most wo n't be interesting , but it 's more for me than anyone else ."
"my friend , lisa , asked me : but what is this all about ?"
"well , lisa , i have to do a little more research on blogs , but that was the initial question from <UNK> when the <UNK> first hit ."
* shrug * some have suggested i write about my past job experience at fox news channel right here in good ol ' <UNK> new york .
"right now i just want to finish the running , the screaming and the nightmares ."
and i want to be fair to those still stuck in the <UNK> .
stay tuned for that kind of <UNK> <UNK> gossip and such ...
"meantime , my mind is occupied with the literary pursuit ( tm ) ."
"some people use their blogs or live journals to post their work , and that could happen here , with any luck ."
"( i 'm working on those issues , by the way , because as you know , i ) right now"
i 'm reading something that 's quite a departure for me .
"it 's not science fiction , but it 's called , by the author himself , weird fiction ."
i went to a reading when he was in town .
"humans , here and there <UNK> - heads poking over the crowd ( allowed in only if their <UNK> were <UNK> ) , the <UNK> - heads of <UNK> ."
"<UNK> hung from mouths , and people <UNK> their glasses or <UNK> in time while <UNK> went between them on the <UNK> floor ."
"from "" iron council "" sounds a bit like our world , with a few plants thrown in ... and that is what draws you in ."
( this was the last scene i read before turning in for the night . )
urllink the way we live now : <UNK> street and <UNK> avenue posted by urllink hello
"i once took my friends for granted , but that 's not the case anymore ."
"we take a lot for granted when we 're young and <UNK> , and my friends always called me ."
what a luxury ; i had no idea !
you hit a certain age and then it 's all work .
"friendship , marriage , co - workers , any kind of relationship involves work ."
""" loser takes all "" is a novel by graham <UNK> , my favorite author ."
"a man on a <UNK> <UNK> wedding and <UNK> becomes obsessed with winning at the <UNK> table , to the <UNK> of his new wife - to - be ."
"but the moral is , of course , that it 's not all about winning ."
"i like that idea ... that just because <#> is n't winning at the game of life , <#> could still "" take all ."
""" ' but it 's loser takes all , '"
i appreciate those of you who have written to let me know of your <UNK> .
"i 'll chip away at the site bit by bit and eventually , all the pictures and stuff will be there ."
"so , now 's your chance to help me build back stuck in the ' 70s the way you want to see it !"
"to anyone who found this blog from my web site , <UNK> , welcome , and thank you for caring enough to find me here ."
"if you read yesterday 's entry , you 'll know that i am in the midst of changing servers ."
little did i know that would mean i would lose my entire web site ! ! ! ! !
"all of those pages <UNK> hosted by <UNK> internet are gone , gone , gone ."
"i thought they would be <UNK> over , but now i ca n't get to them !"
"so , i will be calling tech support tonight after work to see if the files still exist somewhere in cyber space where i can get to them ."
"if not , then i will have to <UNK> my entire damn web site from scratch ."
looks like it 's gonna be a <UNK> weekend .
"luckily , i had saved my front page on my computer -- but that 's the only page i have saved ."
"( i 've learned a very valuable lesson here , folks . )"
"diary pages , hosted on a free server , should still be accessible ."
"this also includes the magazine pages , i hope ."
"please stick with me , and come back and try the buttons to the different pages ."
"if it does n't work , please come back again the next day , and hopefully , by monday , aug ."
"<#> , i will have it all worked out , and back up and running ."
i 'm going to put my head in my hands and cry now .
"well , boys and girls ... i tried to add a link to this lovely blog to my web site last night but kept getting a server write error ."
"in fact , i got so fed up , i switched servers ! !"
"now , with yahoo as my web host , for a dollar less month , i 'll get <#> <UNK> of web space ."
this is going to allow me to put sound and video <UNK> on the web site as well as lots of other good stuff ! ! !
"and , it 'll all <UNK> at the same place and be easier to upload and update ."
"i , for <#> , am excited about this plan ."
first day of school went relatively well for the boys .
the oldest was busted while trying to take a big <UNK> to school and the bus broke down on the way home .
<#> did ok and is ready to get his trumpet tonight .
we 'll be going to our friendly neighborhood discount giant to do that as soon as i get out of work .
more later as i 'm able to finally get things updated on my web site again .
"this weekend , i 'm going to put links to this blog on my web site , <UNK> , so i can get some feedback from visitors ."
"note to visitors : if you 're not nice , your comments will <UNK> disappear ."
"so , keep it clean and friendly please ."
we 've got to get a trumpet off lay away for my middle son .
"<UNK> and when i began fifth - grade band at <UNK> grade school , playing my dad 's <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i did n't like playing the <UNK> so much , but i loved mr ."
"i specifically remember a powder blue leisure suit he 'd wear with a dark blue dress shirt , white shoes and a matching white belt ."
we 're going to have to go shopping for school supplies tonight or tomorrow .
i do love the smell of new <UNK> or <UNK> white notebook paper .
new text books smell almost as good as <UNK> or <UNK> to me .
"luckily , we store up school supplies in a big plastic tub each year , so we wo n't have too much to buy ."
this little beauty is the september <#> issue of tiger beat magazine .
"what 's so special about that issue , in particular , you ask ?"
"why , it was the first time i ever bought tiger beat ."
"i had ridden my bike down to the convenient store , saw the cover , <UNK> with cute boys ' faces , and <UNK> it up ."
it was at that moment that i fell in love with tony <UNK> .
my husband would n't be born for another <#> months .
"it seems you "" feel "" our work is not a <UNK> to the public ."
""" democrats "" are like any other machine , they are either a <UNK> or a <UNK> , if they are a benefit it 's not my problem ."
"i do n't know what was up with that funky sentence structure , in that last blog but i did not plan it ."
and it 's been a little strange to get used to the structure .
lastly what follows is the last test of the day .
"testing <#> , <#> , <#> , <#> ."
this is a test of the color white which comes up blank on the posting page .
"if it looks great i will use it , but i will not be sorry for the errors !"
the whole point is to see what i am doing .
but i am glad to make this progress .
"i hope i will enter twice today , but i my not for this on is just to test the color ."
"i meant to test the color with my last <UNK> , even selected <#> , thought i confirmed it but i was wrong !"
now with this blog it 's more test and less anything . and
"lastly , due to this being the worst work type of week - end does not help either ."
"soon not only will i select colors , i will select if going bold , will help also !"
"for it 's the plain ole ability to see the blog myself , wait til you 're <#> , and have to read what 's going on ."
lastly for this blog i plan to choose a passage in music or book to set the tone of the blog .
"<UNK> back ! the sane <UNK> , back to have fun with the world lovin <UNK> , while setting to battle once again with nurse <UNK> !"
whom herself as come back from hell as <UNK> .
"well i spit the "" free "" <UNK> paid for <UNK> back in her face , and as long as i am able to work and actually pay taxes"
", sunday ( <#> - <UNK> , <UNK> ) at urllink <UNK> ."
he 's an old hippie but he has some good points .
but he 's has been <UNK> by the false dreams of the left .
"this is a test <UNK> , the next <UNK> will be gathering information from different sources ."
then that information will be presented in a way that will foster a more <UNK> thought .
let 's get together so that actual interaction can take place .
we need to rise above our current <UNK> .
"that first means the ending of all social programs , and the democratic party ."
"join me now , or be my enemy , your choice ! i act and respond to those whom hate individual freedom !"
"this is the place for those whom want to fight "" the system "" , and restore america to the "" <UNK> republic "" that it is ."
if i sent you an email that said : “ the big bear is being replaced by giant eagle .
” you probably would have no idea what i was talking about .
first you would try to figure out what “ big bear ” and “
you would <UNK> that these must be important names because they are <UNK> – but you still don’t have enough information to go on . at this point
you have only <#> possible choices : <#> . delete the email and forget about it ; <#> .
reply to my email and ask me to what i am referring to ; or <#> .
"if you live in california , you may think “ big bear ” is referring to big bear lake ."
"if you live in arizona on an indian <UNK> , you may think “ big bear ” is an indian name and refers to an actual person . and"
<UNK> that turn into <UNK> like this happen every single day . )
"but if you lived in columbus , ohio – you would automatically understand that “"
big bear ” and “ giant eagle ” are <#> grocery store chains . so in my original email
i should have really said : “ the big bear grocery store is being replaced by the giant eagle grocery store .
” by simply adding the words “ grocery store ” for clarity –
i could send my email to anyone in the world and they would probably understand what it meant without question .
the point of this article is that you need to think about the person receiving your email before you click the send button .
"just because you understand what your email means , doesn’t mean the person receiving your email will know what you mean ."
i get emails from people ( including <UNK> ) every day with messages like : “ i contacted you about <#> months ago .
"there is no name , no phone number and no other information but i am supposed to remember some unknown person that i spoke to <#> months ago ."
i don’t know of anyone on the planet earth who could do this .
or perhaps you are <#> of those people like me .
you always make sure you write clear and <UNK> emails .
you also review them before clicking the send button and you consider yourself to be pretty good with your email communication .
but <#> day you get an email like “ the big bear is being replaced by giant eagle . ”
which <#> of the <#> choices listed above would you choose to do in order to handle this email ?
would you choose to “ guess ” at the meaning like everyone else ?
"it ’s sad that the big bear grocery stores were replaced by the grocery store chain , giant eagle ."
"for <#> thing , the big bear stores had the best <UNK> food in the city and prepared excellent <UNK> for many corporate functions in and around columbus ."
but the real question here is : “ did you learn anything to improve your email communication skills by reading this article ? ”
i also hope to receive more email messages in the near future that are clear and <UNK> so that i can accurately respond to them .

"unlike an attorney or <UNK> public , a <UNK> forms processor does not have <UNK> limits ."
"in fact , a <UNK> forms processor can set up a <UNK> business in their home with very little money and earn a full - time income very quickly ."
this is where you as a <UNK> forms processor can fill a need that is becoming more popular as electronic filing procedures become more the norm .
"in fact , some states now require electronic filing of all court documents ."
paper documents are only accepted by the court from consumers or in other rare circumstances .
it will not be long before all the states will have electronic filing procedures in place and those <UNK> the change will be left behind .
a typical <UNK> forms processing business might operate like this : <#> .
client either <UNK> or is emailed a set of client intake forms in <UNK> format to print and fill out at their leisure
client will <UNK> or email their completed forms to the attorney or forms processor for review .
"if the attorney decides to accept the <UNK> case , the forms processor can begin <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> from the information provided on the client intake forms ."
the forms processor or attorney will simply call up the client and obtain the information .
"<#> . at this point the attorney may wish to meet with the clients to review their <UNK> <UNK> before filing , but it is not absolutely necessary ."
some <UNK> i worked for never meet the client face - to - face except when they showed up at court .
they <UNK> with the client by email or telephone .
an attorney is provided with an electronic signature by the court that he uses to sign all electronic documents filed on behalf of the client he or she represents .
"after the attorney <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> by email , he or she will save it on their computer under the client file name and begin the review ."
"after the attorney has approved or made changes to the <UNK> <UNK> , he or she will email it back to the forms processor ."
the forms processor will make the changes and prepare a final <UNK> <UNK> ready for electronic filing .
the forms processor emails the final <UNK> to the attorney for final approval .
", the forms processor will <UNK> file the <UNK> <UNK> with the proper court or email to the attorney for printing , copying and filing ."
"as you can begin to see , it would be very easy to start a forms processor service working from home ."

"but the "" do n't get it "" phrase <UNK> the <UNK> ."
but look closely at at <UNK> 's <UNK> of the problems and you find an <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> consistent with the <UNK> <UNK> of his generation .
the <UNK> is simple : <UNK> <UNK> the breakdown of <UNK> education solely to a <UNK> failure .
"<UNK> and teachers think <UNK> and reason <UNK> , he insists , but they do n't express their ideas in <UNK> speech ."
"<UNK> in curriculum proceed , <UNK> of theory have <UNK> , but the academic <UNK> has n't <UNK> them well ."
students shy away only because they do n't speak the professors ' language .
"nothing in the values , principles , and knowledge of the professors is <UNK> ."
"it is , rather , only the communication that needs fixing ."
"the <UNK> are dying , but <UNK> goes no further than <UNK> , "" we have to improve our message "" ( <#> ) ."
". . ] to consider an <UNK> with <UNK> the prime <UNK> of students is to <UNK> other , <UNK> <UNK> of skill and knowledge ."
"<UNK> historical learning , <UNK> reading scores , pitiful writing skills -- all give place to a particular <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"<UNK> education is training in academic <UNK> , not the study of history and literature ."
"as <UNK> <UNK> in to various <UNK> , they found a <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> and jumped to invest in the bold new critical world ."
why should a cutting - edge specialist in french thought ask about the social value of literary theory when so many were demanding his attention ?
"no matter how radical or <UNK> - <UNK> or grave they pretended to be , in truth they were a <UNK> labor group ."
"they were anxious , yes , but for their <UNK> , not their ideas ."
"in the intellectual realm , their self - <UNK> <UNK> , and their <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> ) ."
i am sitting here at home on my last day of freedom before i start a new job and i have to watch my boyfriend 's son all day .
my kids are at the <UNK> but i still have to watch his son .
at least he is n't fighting with me today which is unusual .
"i have a daughter who was born on sept <#> , <#> ."
"i meet this guy who has a son who was born sept <#> , <#> ."
we end up staying together and we all live together now and here we have <#> kids that are a day apart .
talk about some major <UNK> <UNK> and they are n't really even siblings .
you know how women like to be in control of everything .
he can be a little shit too ... <UNK> and <UNK> when something does n't go his way or if he is confronted with something he did wrong .
i do n't understand why an <#> year old child thinks he needs to be <UNK> to an adult and then be able to get away with it .
not that my kids are perfect but they certainly do n't <UNK> adults ... they know i would be on their case if they did .
i am having some problems with my older daughter tho ... she for some reason over the last <#> months or so can not sleep all of a sudden .
i do n't know what her problem is and i ca n't handle this lack of sleep any more .
i need to have my <#> hours or i am <#> grumpy <UNK> ! !
but she still woke me up to tell me she could n't get back to sleep .
i had to threaten to not let her go to the fair and to this amusement park this week to get her to go back to bed ...
she starts school again soon and i do n't know what i am going to do to get her to go to bed at night ........
i'm trying to avoid someone who keeps calling me but she wo n't give up ! if i 'm away from the phone
i ca n't hear it ringing right ? ?
but i do n't want to hang out with her today ...
i said i wanted a peaceful day ... right ! !
"well , since this is my first posting i guess i 'll start off with a little bit about myself ..."
"i am a <#> year old divorced female , mother of <#> beautiful daughters whom i 'm very proud of and plan to talk a lot about on here ."
i have been divorced for a little over a year now and am thankful that i am no longer married to my ex much less to anyone else .
i am however attached to a wonderful man who shares similar views on marriage that i do
so he knows that i am in no rush to get married again any time soon .
i was fired by a man who had been my friend for at least <#> years .
not to mention that he practically begged me to work for him in the first place .
he was n't even my boss at the time he fired <UNK>
this all happened is beyond me but at any rate i am unemployed trying to support my <#> daughters and looking for a new job .
i am really trying to keep positive about the things that have happened in the last <#> - <#> years of my life but sometimes it gets a little hard
so i figured i would use this blog to vent my frustrations and concerns ... hopefully it helps !
i have always been <#> to write my feelings on paper and had journals when i was growing up .
i loved to go back and read them all later and see what <UNK> i was up to .
well now i 'm back and hopefully i can keep up on this ! for now
i have to get dinner going so i will write more later .
"urllink i think that the good people of "" <UNK> "" might have something to say about this ! urllink"
i wo n't say where but the people who think that nj is <UNK> have n't gone here !
"my little <#> was so freaked out by the "" real - life "" <UNK> ."
my <#> <UNK> . loved the hot tub at the hotel .
"next time we come with my beloved on a <UNK> trip , it will have to be to florida ."
i am on my way to sunny virginia tomorrow .
the boys and i are <UNK> along for a few days of sun and fun by the pool .
too bad that my beloved is going to be bored in training .
"the last time i <UNK> a vacation to this god - <UNK> place , i was bored stiff in a hotel room for a whole day ."
"i like having fun with the kids but i 'd be very happy to "" dig in "" with someone 's "" difficult child ."
"i have been a real "" political <UNK> "" of late . here in the great state of nj"
"i voted for mc <UNK> but was n't crazy with his "" performance "" ."
"i do n't care if he 's gay , straight or purple ."
"at the press conference , they <UNK> <UNK> on jim 's dad ."
but i suspect that we will all find out the skinny .
i sure as heck do n't want <#> of their presidents either !
i ca n't wait until the annoying gop convention is over !
"i think it 's mainly because they so strongly appeal to the <UNK> side of me ( hey , does n't everyone have <#> ? ) ."
"with <#> kids under <#> , the house always looks like hurricane betty just went through ."
the floor has needed washing for about a month and the toilet just does n't get cleaned enough .
but me - i do n't care about the <UNK> .
<UNK> and bugs and all that <UNK> paranoia just does n't touch me .
they do such an excellent job of keeping things in order .
their very existence depends on so many <#> lines of perfectly <UNK> code .
"consistent , <UNK> , great for the anal <UNK> - no wonder they have <UNK> the world ."
"of course , i am also a very creative person ."
my efforts on the computer are always directed in a creative manner .
"blogs , photo <UNK> , web sites , forums , <UNK> i love communication and i love creativity ."
now i just have to get these <UNK> to start making me some money ...
"driving a taxi on a saturday night is a good window into society , and while it 's often a lot of fun , it 's not all pretty ."
"<UNK> <UNK> of drunk teenagers home , or even worse , out to party further at <#> am when they are already <UNK> , is just plain hard work ."
"of course , the <UNK> of the money keeps you out there . because it 's a <UNK> night ."
i can earn up to $ <#> on a saturday night : up to half my weekly income in <#> hours .
"but it 's very hard on the body , and hard to see humanity at its worst ."
"the kids take the gold medal in the bad behaviour <UNK> , but that 's not to say all the <UNK> are friendly , generous and polite ."
some senior <UNK> seem to have <UNK> the art of twisted bitterness .
that 's a lot of driving in anyone 's language .
now it 's sunday afternoon and i soon have to go out there and do it all again .
", i have been on the go ever since ."
this probably is a result of growing up in the military on always being on the move .
"born in <UNK> beach and living in <UNK> , north dakota , north <UNK> and virginia , all before the sixth grade ."
"variety is the spice of life , and this can be accomplished through travel ."
"most the places listed below are on my webpage , captured through the eyes of a camera , and most recently a digital <UNK> ."
travels abroad : <UNK> - study abroad program in the summer of <#> .
"we took <#> weeks and a rented car and went all around spain , portugal and <UNK> ."
"got an email from a high school friend , who asked "" what 's new ? "" ."

"i am keeping busy with work , travel , and all that jazz ."
"you know greg is <UNK> , and the wife is now pregnant ."
"roy has <#> sons and <#> is like <#> now , and no <#> <UNK> hears from peter ."
"roy and peter still live <UNK> <UNK> area , greg lives up here in <UNK> near me ."
next month i will have been at <UNK> chase bank for <#> years .
"i actually like my job , and get to do all kinds of fun things ."
i doubt i would go since i do nt even remember who the hell i graduated with ( except you of course ) .
"my passion is digital photography and web design , so you can see all about that on my webpage ( link below ) ."
i do nt know what else is going on .
"oh , i bought my <UNK> <#> years ago for about $ <#> which i thought was outrageous ."
the <#> next door ( and mine is better ) just listed for $ <#> .
"can you believe we have been out of high school for <#> years , college for <#> years , and i have been a home owner for <#> years ."
i plan to get better at it as time goes on .
for someone that size he should have been able to down <#> beers easily !
"if there was every anyone i would love to see get their ass kicked on national tv , it would be paris hilton ."
"i mean plenty of people have been famous for no reason , but my lord she takes the cake ."
"to make matters worse , i just went to cnn to see what was happening in the real world and i read urllink this !"
"yes , i ca n't imagine why so many people hate americans ."
"anyone know if their are jobs in new zealand , is peter jackson making another lotr flick , maybe i can dress as an <UNK> ."
over the last <#> weeks if your into computer ( console ) sports games you know it has been football week .
"i know it is <UNK> august , but it is football season for the fat ass <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i was immediately <UNK> by <UNK> , then i was even more impressed with <UNK> ."
"see i have an addiction , i have to argue with people who claim to be <UNK> , but really are n't ."
"they proudly <UNK> their <UNK> and say "" we do n't use words like <UNK> here ! because we are <UNK> """
"yet they are not alone , go to a place like urllink <UNK> and get the exact same treatment if you slam <UNK> ."
"but at least these guys are n't trying to hide the fact they are biased , i mean it is called <UNK> ."
"so next time you see a post that says i 'm a <UNK> and not loyal to any product , tell them to go screw !"
"i stopped by <UNK> today on the way back from lunch , and i decided to give the new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> ."
my friends i advise you to stay away from this <UNK> of brown pleasure at all costs .
i think someone must have slipped some kind of drug inside of this thing .
"every bite made me feel like that blonde no - name chick in the matrix <#> ( <UNK> , <UNK> whatever it was called ) ."
it was as if the <UNK> women was the weird sounding guy from the matrix giving me a virtual wet spot in my pants with each bite .
"so do yourself a favor , go for something plain like the <UNK> <UNK> and stay away from this <UNK> blast of excitement !"
everyone else is doing it so why do n't i share my unique view with the world .
"it 's going to be mostly about sports , gaming , movies and women ."
that is what my boyfriend said to me tonight .
"i mean , okay , i get the x <UNK> and all but really , who is he trying to kid here ?"
is this why the <UNK> of the species is up to the female side of the human creature ?
) so starting a new relationship during this period of time is kind of a big deal to me .
"okay , he is basically done w/ his <UNK> ."
in chemistry and understands going back to school .
why do i have this strange feeling something is up in <UNK> ?
superman seems to be acting a bit strange . . .
"if you make a big pass at a girl about <#> weeks into the relationship and she says - "" um , yeah , . ."
"can that wait a bit so we can get to know each other better ? """
does this <UNK> mean that you guys take it on the chin as some sort of insult ?
"i mean , he 's gotten away w/ more than my average boyfriends have ."
"i let him and now he may think i 'm pulling back when , in fact , i am just putting some healthy <UNK> around the whole situation . """
at least i am going to nc for a few days
"my friend , and sister of my heart , has asked me to join her to see her parental units in the <UNK> ."
you hate to be single when all your friends are <UNK> up but when you get yours . .
"yeah , you really get yours . and to top the evening off . ."
"an old "" almost "" boyfriend wanted to do something tonight too ."
"but , again , there is the rain and then there are the flowers ."
i 'd better start focusing on the <UNK> and let the clouds just pass me by :) . and my boyfriend is very dear .
i lost the owners manual and do n't know quite what to do with him now . .
"well , since i am <#> of the worst computer users i know and"
"i actually got this thing up and running , i must say , i am quite proud of myself ."
and i know friends will be v. grateful too b/c they will no longer get personal rants in the middle of the night due to lack of sleep .
does anyone else find their mind clearer at this time of day ? ? ?
he 's way smarter than me and hopefully will never find this site !
he 's too busy doing chemistry or whatever . .
i used to work in the arts so what do i know ? ?
? my father used to ask me when i was going to get over my hobby ( arts ) and get a real job .
blue used to be my fav color but by necessity it has slowly evolved to green .
they seem to have very deep thoughts and a lot more <UNK> firing than me .
i was n't sure how i made it through a normal day .
"after reading some of their stuff , i 'm kinda afraid for them now . ."
:) but i do n't want this to be just a diary of what i ate for breakfast and how many visits to the <UNK> i make .
times are a <UNK> ' my friends and we better too .
"my best advice is to read , read , read like things on paper and make it a point to listen to everything around you ."
it 's going in your ears whether you like it or not .
you might as well make a point of making opinions over it .
we only live once my friends and that 's not just a phrase .
ask anyone who has lost someone the desperately and dearly loved .
"pet each moment as you experience it , b/c by it 's nature we ca n't hold onto time . . ."
we can only cherish it as it passes by .
friend of mine is going to play at <UNK> park tomorrow from 11:30 am - 1:30 pm .
anyone in downtown <UNK> - make it a point to come and hear her !
"off to bed and hopefully to sleep , per chance , to dream . . ."
"but just before i leave , i 'd better not get any flaming emails or posts about the title of this blog ."
"i 'm sorry if i may not be as <UNK> and "" dictionary "" as y'all are but at least it 's the truth ."
"not to <UNK> words but , life is life and alot of it is n't all that nice ."
""" we stumble and fall <UNK> , even when we are most enlightened . """
"thomas <UNK> as the quote <UNK> states , no matter how much we think we know . . ."
we 're gonna fall on our ass anyway .
"ok , today has been a very long day ."
but i 'm going to give it a try .
i have a lot of things to blog about and no where to go to let those rants out !
so i 'll call this the test blog ... ....
me = <UNK> i 'm <UNK> or michelle .
i 've lived in california for almost <#> years now .
to date i 'm a <#> ( almost <#> ) year old single mom of <#> grown kids .
i had them early so i could keep up with them.. : : : smile .... actually
"and i decided to raise my children as a young , single mother ."
"i 'm very glad that i did , i have <#> regrets and love my children dearly ."
"i was n't always the best mother , and i learned as i went along ."
each child was different and now they are all almost grown and gone .
"i never want to be divorced , and knowing that i had n't met "" mr ."
"right "" - i was n't willing to settle for "" mr ."
"right - now "" so i 've remained single ."
"i 'm the run - away bride , i 've been engaged several times , but i ca n't seem to make it to the alter ."
"i <UNK> and usually move to another town , although once i moved across the country - long story i 'll get to eventually ."
"i have a boyfriend , his name is jerry , and he 's a year younger than i am ."
we met on <UNK> and dated for a year .
"i lived in <UNK> at the time and he lived at the coast , and still does ."
"after a year of dating we moved in together , me to his house ."
"it was n't a good idea , and <UNK> later i moved out ."
jerry and i have been together for almost <UNK> and recently got engaged .
i asked him to marry me on a radio talk show he loves .
"now , i 'm not so sure that was the best thing ."
"i know i love him , and was recently reminded that "" every relationship does n't have to end in marriage . """
"( thank you <UNK> ) - we 've been discussing a lot of things lately , <#> being that we have nothing in common other than sex ."
"great thing to have in common , however when it seems to be the only thing , well - - i 'm <UNK> trouble down the road ."
i love being in his company and sexually we are <UNK> !
"it 's gotten to the point that him just mentioning he will have his daughter makes my stomach get all nervous , <UNK> , and <UNK> strike instantly !"
i get stuck dealing with it - oral surgery w/o pain would be more fun !
"he gives me what i want in ' that ' area , and i , in turn , give him his ' control ' <UNK> ."
it hurts ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"stephanie and charlie 's daughter , my beautiful <UNK> is katie , she will be <#> in december <#> ."
sometimes that baby girl is the only thing that makes my day worth while .
"i used to think my daughter was a good mother , however , recently i 'm questioning that ."
"she 's doing a lot of crap around the baby that really <UNK> me , smoking is on the top of the list !"
"she was a good ' mommy ' for the first year ,"
and now it 's like she 's irritated by katie .
it hurts me to see her cry or hear her crying while i 'm on the phone with steph .
"she is so impatient with katie , and too often ."
the sleepless nights wo n't leave you be you 're going <UNK>
i ca nt believe the bad streak of luck i am having recently ..... am i cursed or is someone trying to tell me something ?
first i get a scare of possible heart problems on tuesday night ....
friday morning my car is <UNK> with and the alarm wo nt let me start it ....
<UNK> later i get my car back and running .
last night tiny was <UNK> most of the night walking around the apartment crying for no reason ....
<UNK> goes to the vet <UNK> will teach him ) .
so i figure monday starts a new day and a new week and things can only get better ... wrong ! !
i go to the kitchen early this morning and fix a bowl of cereal oblivious to all that is going <UNK> ) .
i am <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to tiny 's hunting <UNK> .
was shocked at the invasion force mother nature had decided she needed .
i had a <#> full bag of cat food on the top of the fridge ....
well it was fully involved with ants by now .....
<#> minutes later after heavy chemical warfare i won the battle but suffered financial and resource losses . <#> $ <#> bag of <UNK> was the <UNK> .
but by god i <UNK> them little bastards with extreme <UNK> !
i feel that i am a good person and do good things for people .
why am i getting a bad dose of karma ?
oh well .... things can only get better no ?
well another update today ..... last night i spent the night in the emergency room with extreme chest pains and a hurting arm .....
no they found nothing to be physically wrong with me .... good or bad ?
i say bad ... my chest still hurts but its not the chest itself <UNK> .
<UNK> spent the whole time with me and for that i am <UNK> she came thru for me again in a pinch and this is time # <#> .
<UNK> onto the subject at hand .... my depression ...
<UNK> even mentioned her observation of me being depressed .... and i agreed .
i feel in a tight spiral <UNK> into an <UNK> and that spiral is out of control .
i feel myself closing in on myself every day more and more .
i scream for the inner <UNK> to cease but those screams fall upon un hearing ears .
i now have to go take a stress test with my regular doctor as a follow up .... me stressed ?
i plan and hope to pull out of my spiral soon and <UNK> the world .
i have chosen this as an outlet for my mental pain that has haunted me for <#> weeks now .
<#> weeks ago i found my cat <UNK> to be sick and shortly after that he ended up taking the big sleep and <UNK> to kitty heaven .
he was in great pain with the number <#> <UNK> killer known .
there was nothing short of <#> - <UNK> in hard cash to save my beloved cat .
with not having the cash available i had to do the <UNK> and put him to sleep .
you would think that this would be the sane and correct decision .
well people tell me it is but why do i feel that a part of my soul i have lost ?
i feel i have lost a part of my soul and humanity .
i suffer from constant guilt on having to make this decision .
the horrible haunting memories of him <UNK> in my arms and being all loving to me while we were doing the horrible act still <UNK> me all the time .
the loving look he gave me as the first <UNK> entered him .
those innocent yellow eyes looking at me have been burnt into my memory and i am constantly haunted by this .
in reality i am pushing them away for my own protection .
i can not afford anymore pain in my heart or soul at this time .
another episode as such will drive me to teh edge with no rescue .
as above i feel a large part of me has gone now that <UNK> is no longer with me .
some <UNK> bastards will <UNK> was just an animal but i <UNK> that in saying <UNK> .
"my companion , <#> of my sanity , and above my friend ."
".... now get me sum treats ! ! """
well i think that sums up things for now ....
well folks this is my first attempt at a blog ..... more to follow shortly
"i 've seen <UNK> wounds , helped <UNK> them up ."
"they hurt , and they are life - threatening , whether from blood loss , massive trauma , or infection ."
to refer to such a thing as minor is to expose <#> 's own ignorance of such things .
"they 'd better keep that up too , because we already know what his record is : he is a <UNK> ."
i had n't realized how addicted to time i had become .
"i kept finding myself moving around whatever room i happened to be in , so i could see a clock ."
"of course , he was embarrassed to admit it was true , so he lied and said it was n't ."
"from a urllink report by <UNK> , march <#> , <#> ."
"during the <#> presidential campaign , cheney <UNK> denied such <UNK> ."
"while he <UNK> that his company did business with <UNK> and iran through foreign <UNK> , cheney said , "" iraq 's different . """
"he claimed that he imposed a "" firm policy "" <UNK> any unit of <UNK> against trading with iraq ."
""" we 've not done any business in iraq since <UNK> ."
"<UNK> were imposed on iraq in <#> , and i had a standing policy that i would n't do that . """
the washington post first reported <UNK> 's trade with iraq in february <#> .
but <UNK> . records obtained by the post <#> years ago showed that the <UNK> were more extensive than originally reported and than vice president cheney has <UNK> .
"not to worry , said cheney , i 'm off the clock ."
"i have no financial interest in <UNK> of any kind and have n't had now , for over <#> years . "" within <#> hours"
", democratic senator frank <UNK> of new jersey pointed reporters toward cheney 's public financial <UNK> sheets filed with the us office of government ethics ."
"in <#> , cheney received $ <#> in <UNK> salary from <UNK> ."
the <#> salary was more than cheney 's vice presidential salary of $ <#> .
cheney also is still holding <#> stock options .
"if president bush wins a second term , that means cheney will make at least $ <#> from the company while sitting in office ."
"<UNK> 's , the other a <UNK> of the foundation for mr ."
bush 's father for his debate when he was running for vice president provided them with strategic advice .
bush 's father faced off in the <#> presidential election .
"in many cases , material offered as proof by these veterans is <UNK> by official navy records and the men 's own statements ."
"kerry ' <UNK> ' had <UNK> praise on him , some as recently as last year . """
cracks are appearing in the <UNK> united party . and who can blame them ?
"he goes , bush flipping off teenagers , a constant <UNK> of negative campaign attack ads ."
"the continued focus on iraq , when we have problems here in this country that go largely ignored , such as the <UNK> economy ."
to say nothing of the forgotten war in afghanistan .
"oh yeah , and the <UNK> that have come to light from within the administration <UNK> torture , and finding creepy little ways to justify it ."
"<UNK> also refuses to condemn the swift boat veterans television ad , attacking john kerry 's <UNK> service in vietnam ."
it seems there might still be politicians in the republican party who see problems with this kind of behavior .
"either that , or they realize they are on a sinking ship ..."
"<UNK> <#> electoral votes ( <#> % of popular vote ) , <UNK> <#> electoral votes ( <#> % of popular vote )"
there is every <UNK> that i will continually <UNK> myself in this record .
"hopefully , this not a product of <UNK> thinking ."
there are too many people i know who do n't seem to think so .
"they see little difference between candidates ; the hot issues of the day do n't really affect them , they say ."
there is such a culture of <UNK> in this country .
"the difference between having no choice , and choosing not to exercise the privilege of making that choice known , is so tiny as to be insignificant ."
"if you do n't choose , you do n't deserve the privilege , anyway ."
there are few things in life that matter more .
"here is what i am talking about : in <UNK> , just a couple of days ago , <UNK> <UNK> won a <UNK> on his presidency ."
"in this country , we are lucky to get <#> % ."
"if the same kind of <UNK> were at work in <UNK> , right now there would be chaos ."
"but , in constitutional terms , <UNK> is a brand new country ."
"they only put together their constitution about a decade ago , and there is still great love of democracy there ."
we claim to be the land of the free .
"part of that freedom , i suppose , is the right to choose whether to vote ."
there are problems with this : voting is the basis of democracy .
"if you are n't voting , you are n't participating in democracy ."
this means that you do n't live in a democracy .
there are few things that are more basic to a democratic society than the protection of those who can not protect themselves .
there is nothing so pathetic than a people who will not fight for that right to self - determination .
a people with so little grasp of what it means to live in a free society does not deserve to live in that society .
"<#> day , i 'm going to become selfish ."
i 'm only going to think of myself and only think my own feelings .
"<#> day , i 'm going to take the whole weekend and do whatever i want , whenever i want ."
<#> day i 'm going to spend money and buy myself stuff like there 's an endless supply of <UNK> .
"<#> day , i 'm going to drive off in my car to some unknown destination and not come back until i feel like it ."
"<#> day , i 'm going to read books , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> non - stop until i ca n't stand it any more ."
"<#> day , will not be next week , and <#> day , probably will not even been next year or the next decade ."
just like today was yesterday ; just like today will be tomorrow .
"<#> day , though , all of this today , will not matter ."
"sometimes , i feel very <UNK> and other times i just think the world has gone a little bit crazy ."
where has gone : respect for other people 's <UNK> .
"do n't people realize you just ca n't go freely onto other people 's property trash it , climb the trees , <UNK> it ?"
"men opening doors for ladies . or maybe the bigger question is , where did all the ladies go ? honesty and integrity ."
this of all things is my biggest issue .
few people seem to have any idea of the concept of just doing something because it 's the right thing to do .
"today , it 's let 's spend all we got and the next <#> year 's worth of money too !"
when will people be content with what they have ? giving more than you get .
"if more people were less selfish and tried to give more than they got , it might be a better world ."
"i 'm so tired of people who only want to take , take , take and then ask for more !"
"gary , my <UNK> the other day , i asked my <UNK> , gary , to cut my hair short versus just a trim on my medium length hair ."
i asked to have an <UNK> cut at my ear area which would highlight my <UNK> .
"as he was completed the job and in our conversation , he told me what a beautiful woman i was ."
"i told him perhaps , i really did n't focus on that since it 's so fleeting ."
"he agreed that was true and further stated "" but <UNK> you are like a rainbow "" ."
"what a beautiful compliment from someone who has known me for over <#> years and seen a lot of my good years , <UNK> , etc ."
then to never be able to go back and see them .
"normally when you leave a job , you can go back and visit but in this case , everything was <UNK> ."
"at this party , <#> of the gentlemen i had worked with and thought very highly of was <UNK> ."
"i had been the office manager and <UNK> , i believe , had been a team captain ."
"toward the end of the evening , he went over to sharon <UNK> 's piano and <UNK> for me to sit next to him ."
several other people were also around the piano .
he then proceeded to play the righteous brother 's <UNK> melody for me - especially for me .
it was like something out of a movie .
"i felt so special , so honored by this man ."
"it was truly an incredible moment , <#> that i think of even to this day ."
"unknown gas <UNK> <#> this particular day , i was very <UNK> ."
all day i had thought about what i had to do that evening and it just ripped me up .
i had to go to the court house and file papers for lack of child support .
"the more i thought about it , the more pissed i got ."
"so , i ran home , took my shower ."
"even without <UNK> my hair or putting any makeup on , i ran out of the house to get the court house as soon as i could ."
"i stopped at the atm and got $ <#> and realized i had to have exact change , $ <#> to file the appropriate papers ."
"so across from the court house , i went into a gas station to get something to drink - anything to break the <#> dollar bill ."
"as i walked up to the counter , there was an african man there ."
"very gentle and softly , he said , "" beautiful "" ."
"i , still being <UNK> , replied rather <UNK> , "" what ? "" ."
"he looked at me and stated a little louder so i could hear , "" beautiful "" ."
"i looked at him in my wet hair , jeans and tee shirt and was totally amazed and shocked ."
"<UNK> him , i looked at him and stated , "" are you crazy ? "" ."
"still looking at me , he replied gently , """
"a thank you would have been enough . "" . still in shock , i paid for my drink and left ."
"had i not been so distracted by my <UNK> mission that night , i am sure i would have <UNK> better ."
i feel bad that i was not <UNK> to him .
"i 'll never be able to thank him , but i hope the favor is returned to him in kind some day ."
following are my favorite <UNK> and words created by me .
feel free to use them and share them !
"in other words , what ever was paid for it was far too much ."
"or , how much did you pay for your car ?"
time tells everything and time has not yet spoken .
"for a woman , i might hesitate . if it does n't happen"
"between <#> ( p.m. ) and <#> ( a.m. ) , it ai n't going to happen ."
used when you are extremely busy but ca n't bear to tell the person no .
who 'd have thought life would have brought them to this place ?
i wo n't ask a man to do anything for me that i would n't do for myself .
"most days , i 'd make a better man than most men out there !"
"yet , during this silence , we are together ."
"our hearts and souls call out to each other , <UNK> the other ."
"while not present , i stand beside you with love and encouragement ."
"unseen , <UNK> , yet , it is in this silence that i am closest to you ."
i 've really enjoyed shopping and wearing all the new clothes i 've been buying lately .
last night i finally got around to trying on the new <UNK> i bought .
"while i really wanted the <#> 's , i could n't find them but these sounded a lot like the <#> 's ."
"they have the lace going around the entire waist area and , of course , the cotton <UNK> is essential ."
i put them on just after my shower and hopped right into bed .
"i jumped out of bed this morning , put my work clothes on and off i went . shortly after getting out of my car and walking into work"
", i realized the <UNK> was riding up my butt ."
i figured i 'd just <UNK> them and i 'd be fine .
"well , within an hour , it was obvious to me that i could not keep <UNK> them all day ."
the fancy lace was scratching my butt and other <UNK> areas .
"after seeing all of those women in the olympic dressing room without any underwear , i thought - go for it !"
so i grabbed a small company envelope and off i went .
"it felt a little weird being partially nude in the company bathroom , but i just could n't stand this <UNK> on <#> more minute ."
got them off and flipped those babies into the company envelope .
what a sense of freedom ! what a sense of <UNK> !
i hope my ass does n't giggle like a bowl full of jelly today and give me away . and
god forbid if i have to <UNK> or cough !
"by the way , what to hell did i do with that company envelope ! ?"
"there were so many apples , i hardly noticed any certain <#> ."
"as time continued , i finally saw you ."
"there was nothing striking to hold my attention , just another apple among so many other apples ."
"slowly , i <UNK> forward , to discover lots of <UNK> and shine ."
"soon , you became the apple of my eye ."
how i <UNK> you and loved to be with you .
you were the best way to spend my day .
"occasionally , i 'd notice a bruise spot here and there ."
a minor brown spot or <#> was to be expected .
how i loved my apple of my eye !
"as i held you in my hand , ever so slowly <UNK> and <UNK> you so ."
"suddenly , the other side seemed so strange to me ."
"yet , i knew the brighter side would soon return ."
"unaware , i sunk my teeth into that golden apple ."
"shock , almost in slow motion , i <UNK> upon it once again . at that apple of my eye ."
"stunned and <UNK> , worms <UNK> out , rapidly through ."
"so confusing , they were calling their names : <UNK> , abuse , lies , <UNK> , cheat , thief ..."
<#> <UNK> look i did make at that once glorious apple .
"there upon , it was tossed back where it once came , back into its world full of games ."
when we are together do you notice the <UNK> in my eyes ?
have you seen the dancing brilliance in them that speaks so <UNK> ?
the smile on my face <UNK> the joy and love i feel for you .
it also reflects the love and happiness you bring to my life .
"i enjoy the very essence of your presence , knowing you are near ."
"no words are necessary , just need to know you are here ."
to touch your hand sends warm <UNK> through me .
a kiss from your lips gives a light sensation of <UNK> .
so transparent and yet <UNK> it easily draws your attention ... and brings you in a little closer .
"oh , what beautiful <UNK> inside so perfectly arranged ."
tea for <#> ... <UNK> <UNK> you in .
"no need to knock , come on in ! in a comfortable and relaxing air ."
slip off your shoes and slide into a chair .
"<UNK> yourself , rest in peace and solitude , <UNK> your spirit and soul ."
especially ... seek the <UNK> <UNK> hidden inside .
"as time passes ... the transparent window remains , just as bright and brilliant , yet , seems barely noticed ."
the seat a little worn ; dust appears here and there .
"more likely a touch of your <UNK> in the physical , encouraging your passions in life ."
but <UNK> a seed which has gained root and has started to develop .
"<#> patiently and <UNK> <UNK> long ago fruit to be born , yet unknown ."
many random thoughts in my mind racing through at this time .
"<UNK> and rag tag as they may seem , here they are for you to see ."
many thank you 's too many to name but just a few : thank you for the abundance of peace <UNK> <UNK> .
thank you for the <UNK> you are becoming .
"most of all , thank you for reaching into the <UNK> of my mind and bringing my inner most thoughts to the surface ."
"what was once <UNK> and <UNK> thoughts calling to me , are now in the <UNK> front of my mind and spirit ."
you have given them life which will make them a reality you are the inspiration that gives them breath .
"most of all , thank you for the quiet , <UNK> music and the dances we share ."
"sometimes like a <UNK> , sometimes like a <UNK> ."
"all the while , holding each other , leading each other and supporting each other ."
"<UNK> , gently , <UNK> , and in perfect step ."
will she find happiness in the arms of the <UNK> <UNK> ?
will the same curse that stole her fiance scott away from her happen again ?
can molly finally stand on her own <#> feet and face the curse head on and defeat it ?
"trust me this room is only big enough for <#> crazy person and me being crazy enough for <#> or <#> people , i fill the room out nicely !"
"but , anyway as i was saying politics here is what i do n't understand ."
let 's say you are <UNK> your own business in ...
"as if <UNK> was n't enough they have to say something to the effect of vote for <UNK> because he is the best choice go my guy ! "" ."
the second this happens the whole chat room goes wild with <#> reasons why this persons political opinions are ridiculous and absurd .
they begin to say truly <UNK> things like ( and i 'm not kidding here )
""" i would rather see my children burn to death in a fire than see your candidate in office "" ( is there another way to burn to death ?"
""" i would rather die than see your candidate in office "" ( then would it really matter ?"
"i swear if your candidate is elected ! "" now , this all <UNK> me ."
i mean i ca n't help but search for some meaning in the order and <UNK> of threats made if this person is elected into office .
let 's look at them : <#> . burned children <#> .
i 'm not a fan of canada either so much but really they have clean air and bears and such .
this would n't be so bad either if everyone was n't quoting some news show or lord forbid some damned actor .
but on it goes for about <#> minutes until finally <#> side or the other starts calling the opposing candidate everything but a moo cow .
i 'm gonna guess no on that <#> !
i mean i just felt bad for his lonely <UNK> eating ass and his <#> cats and his web cam and teen porn .
what i find funny about this ( beyond the obvious ) is the idea of <UNK> toe - licking .
"so , if someone comes up to you on the street and asks you to lick their toes , you 're in the clear ."
"better yet , if someone <UNK> , say , your knees ( your nose , your ears , your <UNK> ) , there 's really no problem ."
you 're looking at ( sort of ) the last remaining member of the orange tribe !
"if that does n't set me apart from the <UNK> , what does ?"
"let 's face it , when halloween comes around and you all are <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> , i m loving it all ."
"i 'm chip daily from <UNK> , texas and my favorite color is orange ."
"according to caroline richmond of urllink <UNK> magazine , "" blogs are a dream come true for <UNK> and <UNK> ."
""" i have to say that after browsing through a couple dozen of them yesterday , she is , for the most part , right on the money ."
"because , no matter how much i want to believe it is n't true , i 'm just like you ."
"i do n't think it 's so much that we 're <UNK> , as that we want to have a voice ."
we want to believe that somehow what we have to say is interesting or meaningful .
"we want to stand out in the sea of humanity and say , "" look at me !"
""" i do n't believe that as individuals any of us are very special , but as a whole , we 're rather interesting ."
i considered how much to say about myself in this blog .... do i give my friends and family urllink witty <UNK> to disguise their identity ?
"because i know myself , i know that if i post my real name , and perhaps something of my professional writing , i 'll self - edit ."
"i 'm those things , but rarely all at once ."
"i expect this blog to be full of opinions and ideas , rather than a diary of what i do from day to day ."
"i go to the store , i have conversations , i do my work"
", i watch some <UNK> , and all of those other in between things like making the bed and sweeping corn - flies off the window <UNK> ."
"for <#> % of the population , it 's not what we do that makes us interesting , but what we think ."
pretty uneventful weekend due to the fact that i have some killer sleeping pills .
i wanted to hit the church but i was afraid the <UNK> would cave in .
instead i decided to suffer and <UNK> through a chain restaurant meal and <UNK> .
"church would have been better , and they serve wine ."
"the <#> things i must accomplish this week are : <UNK> an overnight bag from <#> weeks ago , laundry and change guitar strings ."
rule : do n't eat in chain restaurants . my personal link to insanity
"besides what the doctors , my relatives and all my friends tell me , has finally <UNK> ."
i think i really did get struck by lightning a few days ago .
"it has done nothing for my sex life , but i do n't make the same mistakes over and over expecting a different result every time ."
"so to you from richmond who expect me to drop everything just because you have finally realized what a fantastic woman i am , get real ."
"i hate to see a man make a bad business decision , and letting me cross the state line was poor <UNK> planning on your part ."
i have put a lot of thought into it ...
i ca n't wait to <UNK> my insanely fun life here to go home and be your wife .
and i am pretty sure you would fuck it up pretty soon after i got home .
then i think i would probably burn your house down and steal your dog since you never come home to take care of them you drunk bastard .
you might be able to get laid if you got off the <UNK> long enough to get a hard on .
"i might have moved on to a hottie , but at least i did n't fuck all your friends ..."
"but if i come home and become disappointed , that is exactly what i am going to do ."
"and when you are stuck in the hunting blinds or on a fishing boat with your buddies , they can all tell you how great i am in bed ."
"you already know it is true , so it will eat you alive ."
it 's a slower death than beating you senseless or slowly <UNK> you or me not coming home .
it will take a lot more than <UNK> of <UNK> love every couple of months for me to come running home to your <UNK> arms .
"oh yeah , you better buy a bigger boat , and expect me to <UNK> so not everything in the room is centered around the television ."
"oh yeah , and you need a cd player that plays more than <#> disk at a time ."
and you are not allowed to play my guitar .
"i 'm not going to get married to you , i do n't care how many presidents you are related to ."
i might not even vote republican this year just to hurt your feelings .
"<UNK> of fun you never know ... as i walk through the park , this is what i found in the trash ."
now i wo n't be surprised when i see the homeless at the driving range .
i think i 'll check the bag for balls .
ten minutes later he was back fishing his bag out of the water .
"he went through the <UNK> contents , <UNK> his keys , threw his bag back into the water and went home ."
"i go to the range and tell myself over and over , square up to the ball , keep your head down , feet apart and ass out ."
"when you think about it , all women should be able to hit a golf ball ."
who are those evil bar <UNK> that are sent out by the devil himself to promote sweet liquor drinks ?
<#> of my favorite bar tricks is to eat a stranger 's dinner .
there is nothing more offensive than being asked for a bite of your meal by a total stranger .
"the victim looks at me and says , "" you 're kidding , right "" ."
"it 's a sign of affection "" , i reply ."
i stared down a pizza once at a pool hall .
"the person pointed at the pie , and i went for it ."
"the black man sitting next to him said , "" i ai n't seen nothin ' move that fast since lincoln <UNK> the slaves ."
""" i <UNK> through half of the pizza while he talked to me ."
i run into him and his girlfriend every now and then .
we talk about how much greater <UNK> would have been if i had been there .
at <UNK> i ate all the <UNK> off of someone 's salad .
another time i ate half of a girl 's chicken sandwich while she was fighting with her boyfriend .
everybody knows you have to eat a grilled chicken sandwich right away .
too many sweet drinks makes stephanie a <UNK> girl .
i have managed to put down a <UNK> <UNK> with butter from the french <UNK> across the street .
my regular sweet double <UNK> was too much for my stomach today .
i am also wearing the same clothes as yesterday to work as i im - <UNK> to a co - worker .
she said that she too was wearing the same pants as yesterday and did not have on any <UNK> .
"i at least got a shower , but i had to use man 's <UNK> ."
i smell like a <UNK> and feel dirty from the clothes .
my head hurts so bad that i had to <UNK> around for my bottle of <UNK> .
in it were <#> <UNK> and an arsenal of <UNK> and <UNK> kinds of other pills .
i just took them until i started feeling better .
my multi - <UNK> co - workers are speaking spanish now .
i am such a <UNK> that listening to another language when i 'm <UNK> makes me dizzy .
i followed a friend home from the bar that is <#> blocks from where i work last night .
"now my car with a parking pass , is <UNK> in a guest spot with a flat tire ."
"( they used to call me stephanie "" i never saw a curb i did n't like "" parker where i was from ."
"i can see , no matter where you go , there you are . )"
"she comes to <UNK> from <UNK> , florida , every few weeks with frozen homemade meals ."
we go through the freezer every time i stay at his place .
last night we had sea bass in white wine sauce and <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> squash .
finally i make it into work by the hair of my teeth .
i am looking for the hair of the dog .
my boss just went to the store to get <UNK> for the <UNK> in the <UNK> .
i told her we were out of <UNK> and <UNK> .
she said it was in the first aid case under the <UNK> .
i suppose that is where the <UNK> <UNK> is that i have been looking for .
luckily i was here on time for the second time this week .
i have n't been on time twice in <#> week ever .
it 's because i managed to either stay up all night or crash a few blocks away .
"believe me , there is every conscious effort to be on time , but the forces are against me in every way ."
"instead of a watch , i am going to wear a <UNK> ."
"rule : it 's not important where you 've been , but where you are going ."
"of course , it would be nice to have transportation ."
i wish i could exit and enter rooms by <UNK> .
i like being able run things from <#> place .
rule : it 's very important to have a base .
"the only reality clip worth watching : urllink <UNK> and search video clip for "" flick off the cop """
"never ending <UNK> ... start paying full price , end with beers are free ?"
"even with the tempting yard sale of alcohol , i made it home for the first time in <#> months before last call ."
i almost got struck by lightning smoking outside in a storm the other day ...
"i have no idea what discipline is , but i imagine will power is a huge part of it ."
"all i know is , it started with some <UNK> before dinner ."
"while my <UNK> was <UNK> , some friends managed to hunt me down ."
<#> of us turned into <#> ... after being there for <#> hours ...
how rude that would have been for the new <UNK> .
had to do the right thing and keep drinking .
"cheap , cheap , cheap ... my favorite bird ."
i do n't go out looking for drink <UNK> .
"the first time i ever went out in south florida , i kept asking for my tab ."
"much different from the conservative richmond , virginia , i left behind ."
<UNK> the <UNK> the same as an <UNK> but much more <UNK> ... and you still get the leather interior .
i 'm not very impressed with money that does n't spend wisely .
"he was pissed , although impressed with my <UNK> knowledge ."
i moved my car from a <#> hour parking spot because i was going to leave it there all night ( too drunk to drive ) .
the next morning i could not find my keys anywhere .
"i used to live on a farm , and sometimes i forget which state i 'm in , particularly in the state of <UNK> ."
i thought i might have left my keys in the car .
"they were in the car all right , in the <UNK> with the car <UNK> , <UNK> on , playing <UNK> lee jones all night long ."
"just jumped in it , threw it in drive and <UNK> on ."
"i was going to trade the beast in , but it 's nice to have something in your life you can count on besides getting your period ."
rule : if your too drunk to drive make sure you turn the car off before you catch a ride .
my new girlfriend came and met us out last night ... she 's the <UNK> person i have ever met .
"she only goes by <#> name , like <UNK> ..."
does the mystery mean she has something to hide ?
"so i asked her , "" are you a <UNK> ? """
rule : leather tastes funny when you put your foot in your mouth .
"<UNK> of fun rule : if you ca n't say anything nice , sit next to me ."
urllink you want a piece of me ? <UNK> of fun rule : do n't hang out with professional ball players
... it 's a <UNK> pit of tequila and attitude .
my friends brought somebody new for me to play with .
he liked my girlfriend and tried to talk me into heading down to <UNK> in the <UNK> because she was not going to go without me .
rule : people that have little regard for their own safety will have none for yours ) .
"twist my arm , free drinks and <UNK> rides ..."
"i really did not want to go , i do n't like <UNK> ..."
the player <UNK> that he had been drinking since <#> am that day .
i called him a fucking pussy and told him that i had been drinking since <#> am st .
"i decided to go , evidently he wanted a shot at the title ."
"( i have born and <UNK> tendencies toward the <UNK> , thanks anyway . )"
urllink the drink and i. <UNK> of fun i think the <UNK> bring out the green in my eyes .
"today would be elvis ' birthday , who was the most beautiful <UNK> <UNK> ."
anybody who has had a <UNK> must know the kind of loss i am experiencing today .
i found out yesterday from my ex - husband that elvis died ( on the real elvis ' <UNK> ) .
"if that was n't enough of a coincidence , <UNK> elvis would have been <#> years old today ."
my ex and i cried on the phone together .
there is nothing like a <UNK> marriage in las vegas to ruin a great relationship .
"<#> months into the marriage , i road - tripped to the outer banks in nc for a beach wedding and never came home ."
"i guess you have to embrace everything right away , because you never know where the wind is going to blow you ."
"eventually , i put all my things in storage and hit the road ."
i 've ended up in south florida which is almost a smaller town than the richmond .
"today 's rule : it 's about acceptance , not <UNK> ."
email to fellow blogger : somehow your site came up on my search to find a t - shirt that says “
"i moved down here <#> years ago in october from richmond , virginia ."
the longest time i have ever been away from home was a <UNK> <UNK> program in <UNK> .
my friends at home would say that i could have a vacation with out going anywhere .
"hence the <UNK> , take a holiday every day ."
the birthday in london was something that i could really relate to .
"i guess when you live like you are a movie star you have to stay in touch with your public , or else they forget about you ."
"that ’s another rule , but i stole it from coal <UNK> ’s daughter ."
"i’m glad things worked out for you in <UNK> have had the same experience here in florida ( it ’s a dog track , but it ’s fun ) ."
"i’ve never been , but i understand it was <UNK> for someone like me ."
"it would not be <UNK> of me to pack my cd ’s , guitars and golf clubs to go up and never come back ."
brings components of a very nice <UNK> my way .
reading about your <UNK> makes me feel not so guilty for being a self <UNK> bitch .
"don’t get me wrong , i’m not a <UNK> <UNK> ."
"in fact , when i get <UNK> to drink or buy cigarettes , i make the wonderful people give me a hug ."
"if i don’t get more than <#> hours of sleep in a week , i do sound a bit like a <UNK> <UNK> it ’s better to look good ."
"let ’s get to the part where you inspired my email , before you get bored ."
i remembered your site and thought there must be something there to inspire a smile .
i found out elvis died <UNK> most beautiful <UNK> <UNK> with the most amazing muscle <UNK> enough on <UNK> actual <UNK> .
he liked to have his hair blown dry after he snuck in the shower with me .
it hurt his feelings when i would not apply lip <UNK> to him in the morning .
i used to put <UNK> on his balls and his ears for our day trips to the beach .
it actually <UNK> me to see that dog eat off the floor ( yes we shared a fork ) .
i would spoon him and my boyfriend would spoon me .
"for someone who lives for the <UNK> side of my bi - <UNK> disorder , i am very close to the ground today ."
the animal is the only thing that i have even bothered to keep in touch with over the last <#> years of my <UNK> .
i have had <#> addresses and hundreds of friends during that time .
"from crashing on my ex - husband ’s couch for <#> months to the <UNK> , i’ve talked about that dog to anyone who will listen ."
he is the only <#> i would consistently visit when i would go home .
"i’m not sure if i have a friend named joe , because i call everyone joe ( dark hair ) or steve ( fair hair ) ."
"at any rate , i don’t remember , except to say that there might have been an incident with the police ."
"my car was <UNK> in my driveway the next day , and my windows didn’t have bars on them ."
"it ’s more of a revelation than a resolution , for now anyway ."
so the folks back home are <#> - <UNK> and concerned with machines that have a lot of moving parts .
it ’s not like this is the only loss i have suffered .
but i have not had cause to shed a tear in over <#> years .
"it is true , when you find yourself in a new place , you can be who you are , or <UNK> you want ."
people have not known you enough to put you in a box of expectations .
the trend <UNK> more toward acceptance rather than <UNK> ( another rule ) .
"so we did the pool , and later the hot tub ."
<#> of my guests said that it was the most <UNK> <UNK> of people that he had ever seen .
"what a huge <UNK> you go for <UNK> , the fun is sure to <UNK> the people , not the activity ( another rule ) ."
"if you get down here , i demand some attention ."
oh hi . i think that maybe you 're a little bit insane .
"also , you called me a self - <UNK> bitch ."
"do it again , do it again , do it again !"
i am glad that you are not a <UNK> old <UNK> .
i more glad that you have been drunk for the past <#> years .
"that is quite an accomplishment , something that i can only <UNK> to live up to ."
the moral of this cute little story is that you should make your own blog in order to <UNK> people of your insanity .
"this way , you 'll probably have far less <UNK> orders against you in the future ."
i remember tom petty saying that he was <#> of the only rock and <UNK> left at a dead show with dylan at <UNK> .
now the only real rock you hear is on the classic stations .
"i 've hung & heard , and by some minor miracle am still alive to tell you ... check it out !"
i went on a date with a man from the <UNK> .
i met him at his place on the ocean because he had to watch a few horse races before he went anywhere .
"he says he has a wife in europe , but they are separated ."
i told him that an ocean was separation enough for me .
"after drinking $ <#> bottles of wine over pasta , he pulled out his wallet to pay ."
a <UNK> wallet emerged from his already <UNK> pants .
"i asked him where he got it , and he said that he was no <UNK> , but a jew ."
"i said , "" who the hell are you , <UNK> <UNK> ?"
""" he started out with his first mistake and the most important lesson he ever learned in his life which was "" never get caught "" ."
then he went on to say that he has made plenty of money and all his businesses are <UNK> now .
i asked what they were ... <UNK> .... i bet his wife is buried with jimmy <UNK> and the <UNK> were in blood .
he called me <#> times the next day .
rule for the day : never tell anyone where you live .
"i 've been unable to work since the day of the crash , july 16th , and i 'm so bloody bored ."
i 've just heard that my bike is ready to pick up .
the crash happened at about <#> o'clock in the afternoon during <UNK> 's rush hour .
i had just left a shopping centre and was planning on going to a friends house for a haircut .
i had <UNK> about <#> a mile and got caught up in the rush hour traffic <UNK> back from a large <UNK>
"so i moved into the bus lane , completely legal for <UNK> , and headed up the hill passing all the <UNK> cars in the other lane ."
i was heading up the hill on the other side of the road so the turning into the industrial estate was on my left .
as i passed the turning the guy in the <UNK> cut across me from my right and that 's the last thing i remember about the accident .
the first thing i remember after the crash is hearing a woman 's voice telling me that she was going to take my crash helmet off .
i opened my eyes and saw my bike in pieces on the other side of the road then promptly passed out again .
that confused <#> minute period is the weirdest experience i 've ever had .
i took my car into the shop today to have some work done on the electrical system .
"i had to leave it overnight , so i decided to pop in on my girlfriend at work ."
she just started a new job and she 's been exhausted after each shift .
i wanted to maybe <UNK> up her day a little .
"<#> more buses , the train , and another walk to my apartment ."
the first thing i 'm buying in vegas is a new car .
"well , i mean the first big thing ."
"i figure i 'll probably go to dinner or buy some groceries before i buy a car , but you get the idea ."
i 've set up another blog to post some of my photos on .
"i 'll be posting pictures of vegas on this <#> , but when i shoot models the pics will go on the other site ."
i may also post some stock photos on it . here
it is : urllink <UNK> i plan on buying a digital camera soon .
in the meantime i 'll make do with my camera phone .
my buddy nick moved there about <#> months ago .
i 'll be living at his house when i move down .
i drove to vegas last week and crashed at his place because i wanted to check out the city .
"i 've been there a few times before , but i was on vacation and all i cared about was partying ."
i did n't worry about the important things like : is there a <UNK> 's near my house ?
how close is the nearest movie theater with stadium <UNK> ?
how many crazy people are there walking the streets ?
"the answers are yes , i could n't find <#> , and at least <#> ."
"saturday afternoon , we were walking down <UNK> st ."
"! "" he said it like we 'd been talking for awhile , and he was just picking up where we 'd left off ."
"like if some guy walked up to you and said , "" yeah ,"
"well she should have called if she was going to be late ! """
"now i could have let it go , and maybe i should , but i just had to say , "" we do n't speak american ."
"most of us speak english , you know , the language from england ."
"and since there 's no official language in america , they do n't have to speak it to live here . """
--- ' they ' being the <UNK> which are apparently taking over our country .
"<UNK> <UNK> , coming up here and stealing all the jobs that none of us want ."
"oh but can you leave your food , culture , and music ?"
"--- when i said this , he looked like he was about to hit me ."
"i turned to nick , who had backed away a good <#> or <#> feet and said , "" i am so moving here . """
i will be moving to las vegas within the month .
i 'm setting up this blog to <UNK> my adventures .
"after all , "" what happens in vegas , stays in vegas . """
note to self : must wear more than boxers during late night posting .
<UNK> capital management is dedicated to finding good sound investment ideas in the <UNK> markets .
"founded by donald <UNK> in <#> , <UNK> takes an <UNK> approach to finding stock ideas ."
"manager of the <UNK> fund , <UNK> looks to help individuals and institutions with managing their capital ."
"whether the goal is to grow the capital or preserve it , <UNK> has the passion to make it happen ."
passion is a word that describes how the principles of <UNK> feel about taking care of their clients capital needs .
"<UNK> anne , this weekend you were out of town ."
you and mommy went to houston to see aunt ellen .
we played a spanish cd in the car on the way home .
you love to learn and you make it fun for me to be involved in it with you .
we watched a tv show about the making of the hillary <UNK> concert tour .
it was neat to see your reaction to it since we just experienced her concert the other night .
"you make my so happy to be around you , even if it just for an hour before you go to bed ."
i picked up <UNK> anne from school and we went home and did homework .
"when i told her we were going to a salon to get her hair done , the smile she gave was the first of many on this day ."
after homework we went to seventeen salon and spa .
i made sure everyone knew we were headed to the hillary <UNK> concert .
she looked so cute and many people in the salon told her so .
then we hit the road and had dinner at the hard rock cafe .
we ate with elvis looking over us the whole time .
at hard rock there was a few tables of mom 's and daughters who were also going to the concert .
when we turned the corner and saw the concert venue <UNK> anne was so excited to see all the people .
we parked and walking among many young girls who were dressed up also .
it was a mad house inside trying to buy t - shirts and other stuff .
"she sang some good songs , but nothing like hillary ."
when hillary came out i lifted <UNK> anne up in my arms and we sang the first song .
"the look on <UNK> anne 's face when hillary sang "" let the rain come down "" was amazing ."
"she said "" o this is my favorite song . """
i will never forget her words to me about how much fun she had .
she showed me so much love and i smiled all night .
i sang with her on <#> songs that i knew .
on the way home she called mommy and then fell asleep .
nothing <UNK> there - must stop doing it though .
"<UNK> i am off tomorrow so by working this late , its nearly midnight i shall be <UNK> tomorrow ."
as you have asked so nicely i will tell you .
i probably have more john <UNK> than any other musician ( frank <UNK> and <UNK> are probably the next <#> ) .
now i just have to get the other <#> cd sets in the <UNK> birthday release .
right enough of this <UNK> about on here - time to finish off and go home .
they know this and every so often they crash and burn on me .
the box has only just come back from our it <UNK> guys last week .
so i had to go to task manager to get rid of it .
on <UNK> that i discovered that my screen had flipped so that everything was upside down .
the mouse worked upside down and it was very hard to get it to go anywhere i wanted it .
oh no i thought annoying website has given me a stupid virus and this is what it does .
have to phone the it <UNK> - the shame of it .
"what in the name of <UNK> <UNK> is that for , what purpose can it serve ."
like i say i love to hate my computer .
this link was sent to me by a friend .
i would laugh out loud but people at work already think i am odd .
"i love coffee , i drink too much of it ."
i will drink crap coffee and i will drink expensive coffee .
i go to local coffee shops ( the best being <UNK> brick lane ) and i will go to starbucks and coffee republic .
and there is something very very special with the first cup of the day .
a <UNK> of national pride went through me yesterday morning .
its is talked about in terms of you will remember where you were when .... ... like most people that will be easy for me to do -
i was in my flat listening to it on the radio .
just like <#> years ago i was in my flat watching sir steve win his fifth gold .
"i caught the very end of <UNK> , <UNK> and the other <#> <UNK> ( well who is going to remember them ?"
but for the sake of it all ed <UNK> and steve williams ) did the job and won gold .
i am not a <UNK> fan so know little about the sport .
"<#> of the guys who was supposed to row , <UNK> <UNK> , was being interviewed throughout the week as the team <UNK> ."
"i raise my virtual hat to <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> and williams long may you enjoy the glory ."
well after the adventures of thursday <UNK> friday morning i just knew there was going to be trouble ahead .
"as ever our conversations <UNK> around music , work - mainly the problems of work , art and a few other things ."
<#> of the things i have noticed about my life is that as i have gotten older i have less dreams in life -
in <UNK> meeting up with joel once a <UNK> is a way back to those dreams .
i never expect to be a published writer or sought after photographer but at least now i have started doing both again .
"the coffee went well , the curry went well and was very nice . except that both of us had ordered too much to eat ."
i think i <UNK> out a little as we sat and ate .
but aside from a little discomfort it was fine and the evening was good .
a short trip to a local pub ( apparently <UNK> <UNK> 's local ) and then home .
i made it home with what must have been seconds to spare .
"and i was there for a <UNK> time , each <UNK> slightly less extreme than the <#> before ."
when i eventually got of the toilet to flush - it was as if jackson <UNK> had decorated the inside of the toilet bowl .
i had to make <#> more trips to the toilet before i felt it was safe to go to bed .
saturday was pretty much me recovering from whatever it was that turned me into a human version of mount <UNK> .
obviously for the young and the beautiful thursday night at <#> am is the normal kick out time from the local clubs .
so brick lane was <UNK> with people walking home ( after having had a better evening out than i had had ! )
"the thing about brick lane and <UNK> is the amazing mix of old and new , modern and traditional ."
small indian <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> large trendy <UNK> .
style victim shops sit <UNK> clothes shops where your granny goes to buy her <UNK> and such like .
in short its an area of <UNK> . its also an area that is supposed to have a large proportion of the east end <#> artists
", you wo n't be surprised to learn that i want to become <#> of that group !"
with that in mind it is nice to see that some things never really change that much .
last night as i walked home <UNK> on my <UNK> i saw <#> ladies of the night .
only <#> of them asked if i was looking for business .
"all of them fleeting , some happy , some sad , some important , some just <UNK> ."
some moments can change the way you think for the rest of your life .
other moments can just <UNK> the lessons of life .
i was out late in a part of london i do not go to often .
so i needed the night bus to get home .
the event ends and i <UNK> along to the bus stop .
i am thinking about how much i like being out in the city late at night .
"i am thinking how quite this part of north london is , i am thinking <UNK> its chilly ."
i am less than happy as i want to get home to go to sleep as i had work later .
"so i decide , in frustration , to phone london transport 's information line . and"
a helpful man ( ross ) told me that the <#> was running - just it was delayed .
of course by the time my sleep deprived brain could work out what was going on the bus had reached its stop and had moved on .
well it shows and <UNK> that the luck of pat comes in <#> kinds none and bad .
so another <#> - <#> minutes later there is the bus i want .
i woke up to the sound of the radio <UNK> and the feeling my bed was on fire .
a few days back i went to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> - a little man with a mighty mighty voice - live in concert .
i had given up going to <UNK> several years back
"but there was something special , something awesome about going to see the man whose voice has been there through much of my musical listening career ."
he was there when i air <UNK> to rainbow .
he moved on to black <UNK> and then he formed his owned band .
"the <#> constant through it all was his great voice ( and his fascination with <UNK> ) . and to see him live , ah it was a treat ."
by the third song he had already done <#> classics that i had never expected to hear .
"it was a set that demanded air guitar <UNK> , fierce <UNK> and <UNK> hand <UNK> ."
"it was a thing of beauty , a thing of joy and i am still <UNK> it now ."
i <UNK> you <UNK> james <UNK> it was a gig worthy of the <UNK> .
well i have to as i use it a lot .
thanks to a situation of financial embarrassment ( all of my own making ) i am forced to use the buses instead of the tube .
recently it has gone from double <UNK> - which made it easy to spot at night ( it was the only double <UNK> on the route ) .
then it went to having on of the few healthy fuel cell buses .
"looked great - lots of steam coming out of it , very quiet and a smooth ride ."
now they are <UNK> buses - like to single <UNK> stuck together in the middle with a <UNK> middle to allow it to turn corners .
"but the driver no longer takes your money and you have to get your tickets before boarding , and just how often are the ticket machines"
"<UNK> .... i reckon a lot of people just hop on and do n't pay , i wonder if the route is losing money ."
it 's a nice theory in practice the route seems even slower as the drivers just seem to hang around the stops .
<UNK> next i will be talking about how the price of mars bars have gone up since i was a kid .
there are things i know are bad for me and <UNK> fall into that category .
"oh alright i am fat , i suppose i am technically <UNK> but i luckily do not look like the <UNK> <UNK> man , i just look <UNK> ."
what makes them taste even better is that i know they are bad for me !
so why am i doing this ? who knows .
i know for a fact i live a dull and <UNK> life that would bore to tears most sane and normal people .
so perhaps this is a form of revenge on those of you who have interesting lives .
the olympics are on at the moment and probably for the first time in a <UNK> while i am not interested .
"there are other reasons why i do n't want them coming to london , but that <#> will do for now ."
"gotta feel sorry for the <UNK> guy , by expecting him to win <#> <UNK> anything less than that and he 's a failure ."
but just by being <#> of the best at what he does he should be receiving the <UNK> of most of us .
mind you do n't feel that sorry for the usa dream team - was good to see they lost to <UNK> <UNK>
and i still have n't answered the question of why ?
i can tell you the answer is n't <#> .
this is a test to see if it works nothing interesting here - move along .
"so there is all this talk about "" being in the moment , "" what is that all about ?"
"to live in this moment , where did this philosophy and/or approach come from ..."
how and where did this become <UNK> in my life ...
"this guy <UNK> <UNK> and others developed this <UNK> approach in the <#> ’s ... using this <UNK> approach ... """
through living in the present we are able to take responsibility for our responses and actions . to be fully present in the here and
"now offers us more excitement , energy , and courage to live life directly . """
urllink <UNK> hell if i knew where this thread of knowing went .... so this is just something to chew on ...
<UNK> and doubt are they <UNK> exclusive concepts ... ? ?
"i am <UNK> that i know anything at all , i am doubt <UNK> of this <UNK> in the choices i have made ."
"i am <UNK> that i am without <UNK> , this i am sure of ."
"people need to talk , need to look and talk about what other people have to say , to stand in judgement and hold themselves in higher regard ."
"i am above that , i am right and she is wrong ."
they are bad and awful and full of <UNK> .
they are bad and full of <UNK> and must be <UNK> away from this true and <UNK> state .
""" i am sad to be in this spot ."
"sad right now anyhow , sad to know that for this moment in time i and my choices are the subject of idle gossip ."
""" you do n't have to justify anything to anybody . "" easier said than done ."
social institutions and rules to keep thee in check .
"to hold up as the right and <UNK> in the world , in this world ."
leave like children swing in groups outside my window switching spots and playing jumping games <UNK> turning spinning swirling little people on the wind
"( where <UNK> , i <UNK> recall learning to swim out of fear of being <UNK> by the big kids ) ."
do n't ' cha love the smell of the earth ... it is a distinct smell ... rich and alive ...
the earth under this new road is white and brown and black - what makes these colors ?
we met a new friend from a <UNK> forum for lunch today .
we loved meeting her and her very beautiful little girl .
jon and i desperately want to be parents but i had a <UNK> <#> years ago .
"we have no problem with <UNK> , other than the fact that we ca n't afford it ."
i made a pig of myself with some <UNK> pasta .
we are having our new computer desk delivered tomorrow and i am so excited .
we have friends who bought a huge office full of furniture to sell .
we bought this enormous wood desk and a small round table for a <UNK> good price .
i swear <#> day i need a huge home just so i can buy furniture every week .
i also bought <#> chairs at a garage sale .
"but i swear , i 'm finished buying furniture for awhile ."
i have a conference tomorrow to learn the computer system at the junior college i will be teaching at starting monday .
i have <UNK> beyond where i ever thought i would or could !
it 's the 4th in the thursday next series .
it 's hard when you finish a really good book and you know it will be awhile before another really good <#> comes your way .
i was reading reading <UNK> in <UNK> before i realized the latest <UNK> book was out .
"i 'll go back to that <#> , but i do n't really want to leave the <UNK> behind ."
i might have to <UNK> the first <#> .
i really need to get off my ass and get over to the school district to register as a substitute teacher .
it 's pitiful that i have to find a second job .
"i am such a bad <UNK> , so glad he 's doing it ."
there we go . took me a moment to figure out how to <UNK> a blog .
"i have no idea if this will actually work since i clicked on the "" edit html "" button ."
"but it would n't let me type anything when i was in "" <UNK> "" mode ."
i went to the dentist today and found out i have to have a gum <UNK> .
no <#> ever taught me how to properly brush my teeth .
"it looks good , i was <UNK> about the color ."
he 's an engineer but he has n't been able to find an engineering job so he 's working for border 's .
neither <#> of us are very happy about that .
i 'll be starting my new job as an <UNK> faculty member at a local junior college .
"i 'm afraid of expecting too much from the students . then again , i do n't want to treat them like idiots ."
i ran around cleaning all morning because grandma ( and mom and dad ) was coming at <#> am .
we went nuts and the whole family was actually helping .
thank goodness they were <#> <#> hours late .
"we got a lot done - plus did some "" <UNK> - and - dash "" ."
of course as soon as mom got there she pointed out all the stuff on the <UNK> i forgot about .
"grandma was no trouble and after i drank coffee ( mom stress , i guess )"
i started with a few bananas in the morning and an hour or so later i ate a almost a whole <UNK> .
"i was trying to get the kids to eat it , but they did n't want much ."
"i know i need to eat more during the day , but i do n't feel so hungry until i smell dinner cooking ."
"bill made chicken wings , string beans , and rice ."
i read another article about how rushing into going <#> % raw is way too severe for most people .
it pretty much made me feel better about the rate i 'm going .
"i ordered a couple of "" raw "" books ."
the <UNK> by <UNK> and the <#> by <UNK> <UNK> .
it will definitely help me to have these in front of me and always visible for constant motivation .
"<UNK> ( <#> ) , julia , has mild add and i have her on a <UNK> therapy called attend by <UNK> ."
"it 's been several weeks and i do n't see much , if any , improvement ."
maybe i need to give it more time .
i 'm going to encourage her to go raw with me .
i know raw living is good for mental clarity and has helped kids with add .
the <UNK> acres website mentions <UNK> ( <UNK> ? ) as an essential <UNK> .
it 's supposed to be great for kids with add - along with a high raw diet .
"i 'm going to try that very soon , too ."
"i 'm also trying behavior <UNK> , and maybe <UNK> somewhere in the future ."
"so , the weekly stats are exactly the same as last week ."
i think i 'm going to do things a bit differently this week .
i want to see a change by next sunday !
we just got back from <#> flags ( new england ) .
the kids had a great time and thank goodness we got to crash at a hotel last night .
i do n't think i would have been able to make the drive home at <#> pm .
"i was worried about eating , but did ok under the circumstances ."
i ate half of my last <UNK> friday morning followed by coffee and a roll for the drive up .
"at the park i had a beautiful , huge salad for lunch with a bottle of <UNK> spring ."
dinner and this morning 's breakfast was a different story .
"now that we 're home , though , i 'm doing good ."
i just had a red <UNK> and am about to have some greek salad that bill is making .
"his has <UNK> , mine wo n't , but it has <UNK> , tomatoes , red onion , <UNK> , and green pepper ."
it 's getting a little easier to break old habits and not eat like a pig just because everyone else is .
i really love food and i 'm glad i can eat a lot of the raw food and still feel in control .
"we kind of have to "" babysit "" her since mom and dad are going to a party and <UNK> has <UNK> and ca n't be alone ."
"it 's funny , after <UNK> juice , grandma starts walking around the house a lot ."
i guess it really does give you energy !
"i did n't do all that great this week , so i probably have n't lost anything yet ."
"no matter , it 'll just motivate me to do better next week ."
urllink i felt kind of energetic today .
i slept pretty good last night and got up at <#> .
"i wanted to do so much today with the kids , but when the house is a mess i ca n't go anywhere until it 's <UNK> ."
"the kids really enjoy just going out on the block to ride bikes or play tag with friends , but we never got a chance to get out ."
"well , we 're going to <#> flags tomorrow , so that should make up for today !"
i <UNK> <#> left so i better get shopping .
so i have to remember to tell him to pick some up .
later on i ate a few <UNK> and a few dried <UNK> and at around <#> pm i had a huge amount of <UNK> .
i actually feel full without feeling like i ate too much .
i will probably have a very small bowl of it with a very big salad .
"wow , i usually have about <#> a day ."
"i read that in order to lose weight with raw food , you should n't eat stuff with a lot of fat or sweet fruits ."
of course my favorite things are stuff with a lot of fat and sweet fruits .
then i had such a delicious <UNK> a little while later .
"we were your basic northern european , irish , english , italian family complete with huge amounts of cooked food ."
we thought <UNK> and <UNK> were weird and only saw them in the spanish <UNK> down the street .
a few hours later we all shared a big bowl of red grapes .
i feel so good after only fruit in the morning .
"i 've done that before with fit for life , <UNK> , and <UNK> <UNK> 's total health <UNK> ."
"i do stay raw usually until <UNK> , so i feel i 'm ahead of the game ."
today 's lunch and dinner were <UNK> so let 's not even go there .
i 'm drinking mainly spring water or fresh juice now - no more pepsi or iced tea .
"the better i feel , the less i want to smoke ."
tomorrow i 'll break out that <UNK> tape i 've been meaning to get to .
"yes , i like to make it <#> word ."
"i feel i have the <UNK> of it down , but i 'm still reading everything i can get my hands on about the subject ."
can changing <#> 's diet like this really change the person ?
i have n't been too thrilled with myself lately .
"after <#> kids , my weight is up there and i look and feel like hell ."
"i started adding more and more raw food into my life a couple of weeks ago , but this week is my true beginning ."
i am in love with the idea of natural <UNK> and living the way i know we 're supposed to .
"i 'm in what they call a "" <UNK> "" phase right now ."
i am eating a few complicated meals trying to get the taste and feel of cooked crappy food .
"but i do appreciate the simple , <UNK> foods as well ."
i think i 'm at around <#> % raw at the moment with the expectation of getting to <#> % in the near future .
let me tell you what i ate today .
"ok , i 'm down to <#> cup <#> or <#> mornings a week ."
not bad for someone who <UNK> on that <UNK> daily caffeine <UNK> just to get some <UNK> done .
"anyway , i ate a banana and drove with everyone out to my mom 's ."
bill ( hubby dearest ) took off today to spend some family time .
i actually brought a huge <UNK> of food and my old <UNK> .
at mom 's i cut up a nice <UNK> and threw it in the salad ( instead of dressing ) .
she loves fresh juice - and makes killer <UNK> .
at <UNK> dad ordered out pizza and salad .
so i had <#> slice of pizza with a giant sized plate of salad .
i ended the night with <#> glass of <UNK> and <UNK> about <#> cigarettes for the day .
i am quitting this <UNK> habit on my <UNK> birthday which is in exactly <#> days .
most days are like this - last week was worse - next week will be better .
i have a bit of a hard time with peer <UNK> <UNK> of suggestion - call it what you want .
"weight : <#> ( i 'm <UNK> "" , so this sucks )"
"<#> "" waist : <#> "" hips : <#>"
""" upper arm : <#> "" thigh : <#> """
i was a little surprised in <#> ways by this film .
"first , it 's opening weekend take being in the $ <UNK> range ."
i thought <UNK> would debut at # <#> at best .
"hell , it nearly out did the # <#> and # <#> movies for the weekend !"
"secondly ( and this goes hand <UNK> - hand with the first ) , it was a little better than i anticipated ."
"do n't get me wrong , it still had at least <#> really <UNK> scenes ."
"my only complaint regarding actors would be that of the female lead , <UNK> <UNK> ."
i do n't think that it 's because i do n't like her so much as she does n't seem to fit the role of an action movie .
i did like the touch of bringing lance <UNK> in on the project .
"for <#> thing , i just like his rough voice , but also for series <UNK> ."
they had a quick shot of him that relates to a prior movie .
they had a <UNK> of nice <UNK> to the prior movies for anyone that would notice .
"i mean come on , the first <#> to go down did n't even see it coming ."
"oh well , perhaps it was meant to be a bit of a surprise since most people seemed to think that <UNK> would <UNK> the floor with the aliens ."
i thought the only real strength the aliens would have over their <UNK> would be strength in numbers .
who knew they are as <UNK> as the <UNK> ?
i <UNK> left much out to leave room for discussion ( and i 'm just tired of typing for the moment ) .
"since i am just starting out with this , my postings will be a bit of a <UNK> - <UNK> of movies , and in no particular order ."
i will probably just start with the mostly recently seen movie and go onto new movies seen mixed with prior movies .
what i mean is i have opened the door to my little forum on <UNK> .
urllink <UNK> i will not stand by and not share
", sort of <UNK> know what i mean ?"
"anyway , anyone who thinks they can just <UNK> in and start bashing or <UNK> is in for some challenges ."
"i have been on <UNK> long enough to know that there are some serious shit <UNK> , and i will not have that happen ."
"urllink fall is almost here , you know what that means . back to school <UNK> ! !"
of course she was here <#> mins earlier than she said she would be .
so there we were at <UNK> just dressed when she showed up .
oh well she sat and had coffee with us while the kids ate their cereal .
we gave her a full tour of the new church which totally blew her mind .
but on a good note we are done with the visit until xmas so i can get down to serious <UNK> .
"mum , went on and on about how bad a dog would be but i tried to ignore her ."
my mother in law is coming in less than <#> hours and i am not even freaking .
ok i am freaking but i am not ready .
i need to <UNK> the family room and clean the upstairs bathroom .
i just ca n't get into it this time .
maybe it was the horrible <UNK> reaction i had from my lunch .
omg i am in so much pain from the stupid green junk .
i do have a great little parent moment to share .
<UNK> my oldest was at a friend 's house last night while the parents were out .
"this shows great control and shows that he listens , and can be trusted ."
"today it is a bowl of <UNK> , in a few years it will be a beer at a party ."
"time for bed , yes all my energy is used up for another day ."
it seems i owe hubby some good lovin ' since he was able to let my <UNK> down easy about next weekend .
as well she has agreed to go to a chinese all you can eat on sunday for the kids .
lets just home they have a great salad bar .
i am not paying jenny craig money so i can just screw around on food i do n't even like .
"i am so sad , <UNK> 's family is having a huge garage sale saturday morning , the only neighbor i liked on this street is moving ."
"and i got coffee , the kids wanted some water to go with their donuts so we asked for a couple of cups ."
""" i am sorry , we only sell bottled water "" was the gals comment ."
we drive up to pay for our stuff and hubby asks again if he could just have a cup of tap water for the kids .
she sticks to her story that they ca n't do that they only sell water .
if we were inside the store she could give us tap water .
it really pissed me off since we were not just asking for water we were dropping at least <#> $ there for other stuff .
my husband just does n't get why i am on here again .
i have never in my life seen someone so <UNK> with laundry .
it can be piled up in the laundry room all clean but it has to be clean .
i think it would be fine if he put the <UNK> ( not anymore ) stuff away .
"he talks about them all day long , everyone he sees he has <UNK> on them ."
his big fun is to bump me and make them bounce .
"ok , my youngest is totally <UNK> with boobs ."
"i think just figured this dang thing out , <UNK> i am not , just a tired old woman . lol ! !"
what do you think it is that makes otherwise private people jump into the net and tell their lives to total strangers ?
do you think it is our <UNK> need to reach out ? or maybe for some a need to show off ?
"heck i do n't even know why i am doing this , i saw a friend had <#> and thought why not me too ."
well it is sunday morning and i 'm out of cream for my coffee .
sunday mornings are not suppose to be like that .
at least that 's the way i see it in my world .
the weeks events took me to work and a funeral .
a close friend of mine lost her great grandmother and the service was held on friday .
i grew up with shannon and have always been <UNK> <#> of the family .
shannon has a large family who are all very close and know how to celebrate life .
it was wonderful to see them all and great to take a little trip down memory lane .
"so that is <#> weddings and a funeral this summer , i bet that would make a great movie !"
"it 's cold in my apartment this morning and i 'm just the picture of <UNK> with my <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> and sweater on ."
should n't it be summer for pete 's sake ? !
after i run for coffee cream i will sit and try to <UNK> out how to put pictures up on this thing so stay tuned ...
"well let 's see , what did i do today ?"
tonight i 'm going out to dinner with my son and daughter in - law in celebration of their birthdays .
"we are going to a <UNK> little <UNK> called "" le <UNK> "" ."
there are only about <#> tables in the place and you have to make a <UNK> weeks in advance .
ok i better run downstairs and get my clothes out of the dryer before someone <UNK> it and sees my large cotton panties .
the last time that happened i caught the girl with them in her hand
well today is the begining of my postings .
i found this wonderful site through a dear <UNK> of mine who enlightened me of a daily posting being done by mutual friend .
this friend ( and i use that word loosely lol ) happens to be a tad brain dead in his faith of my beloved tiger cats .
i look forward to writing and keeping you informed on my well being .
i had just finished a big <UNK> job in <UNK> .
"an addition on the garage , and an <UNK> and <UNK> of the rear patio ."
i made enough profit to pay for my big vacation to the <UNK> .
i was planning on spending the entire month of august in the frank church wilderness in idaho .
the first day on the road my dog shadow and i were traveling west on <UNK> .
"headed to the <UNK> family reunion in <UNK> , <UNK> ."
i got to mile marker <#> when it began to rain a little harder .
we had just spent over <#> minutes traveling up the ridge that is just west of <UNK> .
driving was slowed because of a <UNK> - trailer that had <UNK> at the top of the hill and caught fire .
very slow going but i was n't in a hurry .
"the reunion was n't untill the next day and after all , i had weeks to do anything i wanted ."
i started down the other side of the mountain just passed where the <#> <UNK> had been pulled to the side .
traffic was relatively light and some of the cars <UNK> past me .
at about mile marker <#> i hit a deep puddle in the road .
"i 'd been in a few <UNK> before , but never at this speed ."
i guess i was lucky there were no cars near me as i was all over the road .
i had loaded everything into the very back section so shadow could lie down behind the front seats . which is where he was at this time .
"i knew better than to hit the breaks , but tapping them did n't seem to help ."
i was handling the slide pretty well ( i thought ) considering how fast we were traveling .
the car never turned completely around and i thought it was beginning to <UNK> .
just a light tap on the left side of the car .
that tap <UNK> - <UNK> us to the other side of the highway and we hit the other <UNK> almost head on .
the impact was so severe that it broke the front <UNK> on the right side .
"i have always worn a <UNK> , and it definately saved me from going through the windshield this time ."
at this point i began to think that maybe i would n't be getting to the <UNK> any time soon .
i ca n't remember being scared during this untill we came to a stop .
"he was shaking , but seemed to be moving around pretty well ."
"i said "" shadow , we gotta get out of this car ! "" i had no trouble <UNK> my <UNK> , but the passenger door would n't open ."
i realized that my engine was still on and turned it <UNK> rain was coming in as i stood up and looked out .
i was surprised to see a lady standing right next to me .
she asked if i was all right and i said i was better than my car war .
"she asked if there was anyone else inside and i said "" just me and my shadow ."
""" i think she thought that that meant i was alone because she seemed surprised when i said i had to get my dog out first ."
all my stuff was completely trashed and it was difficult finding his <UNK> .
i did n't want to have to explain that .
i finally found shadow 's <UNK> and handed him to the lady .
""" man , was he ever glad to get out of that car ."
the nice lady was a nurse and gave me some first aid .
i had <UNK> my left arm on the highway and it was completely covered with blood .
i was pulling glass out of my skin ten days later .
... to be continued tomorrow ... .... .... .... .... ....
the <UNK> police department ( <UNK> ) buried <#> of it ’s own today .
"officer <UNK> came under heavy fire by anderson , a <UNK> who used an <UNK> military - style rifle , shortly after he arrived on scene ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , a former us marine , is survived by his wife and <#> year old daughter ."
"as i’ve said time and time again , it ’s kerry who has brought this stink upon himself by running under the campaign theme of ‘"
war <UNK> it was kerry and his campaign that in the beginning started comparing bush ’s military records with kerry
so now kerry ’s pissed b/c this whole thing has <UNK> on him .
""" the ad calls the attacks "" <UNK> "" and "" lies . """
"kerry , bush can’t back this group for it ’s a <#> organization ."
federal law <UNK> any direct involvement between private organizations such as swift boat veterans for truth and anyone connected to a presidential campaign .
bush can’t advise them <#> way or another or <UNK> be accused of supporting them .
"kerry , you need to get off your high horse and face the music here ."
it ’s not bush that started comparing military records ; it was you .
"kerry , you’re the <#> who has pissed off and re - <UNK> the vietnam veterans fire for referring to yourself as a ‘ war <UNK>"
so quit trying to <UNK> attention to bush ’s military records and face your medicine like a man .
this has everything to do with you and your conduct both during and after the vietnam war .
""" the next day he 's standing there , ' i want to be president because i 'm a vietnam veteran . """
maybe he should apologize to all the other <#> <#> veterans who served .
"he was n't the only <#> in vietnam , "" said <UNK> , whose world war ii wounds left him without the use of his right arm ."
"<UNK> added : "" and here 's , you know , a good guy , a good friend ."
but <#> purple hearts and never <UNK> that i know of .
"<#> purple hearts and you 're out . """
"former senator bob <UNK> is correct here , kerry needs to address these issues , instead of <UNK> attention to bush ’s military service ."
"war <UNK> crap seriously , and especially his comments he made to the senate in <#> , as <UNK> described above ."
"they were <UNK> for , and his testimony was <UNK> of an officer ."
congratulations to former university of tennessee track and field star urllink justin <UNK> for his gold medal in the men ’s <UNK> dash on sunday .
"<UNK> ran the <#> in a <UNK> <#> seconds , the fastest in the world this year and his personal best ."
"<UNK> at age <#> years old , becomes the youngest <UNK> <#> meter <UNK> since jim <UNK> in <#> ."
"this is what i was born for , "" <UNK> said ."
""" this is why i started running , and this is why i live ."
"i said it was going to be the most exciting race in the world , and it was ."
"this is what i train for , that 's why i <UNK> the snow off north carolina tracks ."
i 'm here to win the gold medal .
<UNK> froze the clock at <#> to win his first olympic competition .
<UNK> finished just <#> - <UNK> of a second behind in <#> to earn silver .
<UNK> 's <#> <UNK> proved good enough for bronze .
<UNK> also ran a <#> to win the gold <#> years ago at the <#> sydney olympics .
"<UNK> , the last of the american <UNK> , finished fourth in <#> ."
how fast was <UNK> 's time when compared to other <UNK> ?
<UNK> 's <#> would have won every olympic <#> title in history with the exception of <#> .
"<UNK> entered the <#> games with a season - best <#> in the <#> , the world leader this year ."
"in the fall of <#> , <UNK> arrived at tennessee as a good high school <#> <UNK> ."
"after training and competing in tennessee 's program <#> years under the <UNK> guidance of former vol assistant vince anderson , <UNK> won <#> consecutive <UNK> titles ."
"in fall <#> , <UNK> announced he was leaving tennessee after his sophomore season to join the professional ranks ."
"just <#> years later , <UNK> <UNK> the world stage to <UNK> claim the title of world 's fastest man ."
<UNK> becomes the first former vol to win an olympic gold medal in an individual event .
tennessee legend sam <UNK> won a gold on the <UNK> relay and a silver in the <#> in the <#> los angeles olympics .
i read a few weeks ago that iran ’s nuclear facility was a concern of germany ’s .
well i’ll be ; <UNK> ya want the us to do about it ?
"try going to the un and see what <UNK> do about . or better yet , do something about yer selves !"
we kind of have are hands full at the moment ...
"but , i am interested in seeing where this <UNK> threat goes ."
"i guess iran thinks that the us will not open another war front in an election year , so they’re going to run their mouths a little ."
"i guess too , iran has an impression that there will be no <UNK> action taken against them ."
how can you blame israel even if they do attack iran ’s nuclear facility ?
i mean they israel destroyed iraq ’s nuclear facility in <#> and the world should thank israel for their act .
i’d pity the <UNK> fools if they decided to make good on their threat .
"<#> us aircraft <UNK> would all it would take , but i’d love to see israel open a can of <UNK> <UNK> on them ."
"even when i turn on tom <UNK> tonight , i will come away with the impression that israel is a world power intent on <UNK> middle east affairs . and"
even iran is now taking pot shots at her .
"looking at how far the country of israel has come since the <#> ’s , i can see why they’re a <UNK> in the side of the arab world ."
"it ’s interesting to note that <UNK> , the palestinian leader"
", was granted some <#> percent of the west bank and some control over many christian and jewish holy sites , yet he turned the proposal down ."
"many see this a sign of israel taking land from the <UNK> , but just as the berlin wall was used to keep the east bound to communism ."
"it ’s also interesting to note that the un hasn’t even <UNK> the words suicide <UNK> , which <UNK> the construction of the fence in the first place ."
"fifth , the palestinians are without a voice , with no means of managing their own news ."
an organization named reporters without <UNK> has reported numerous occasions where journalists were beaten when they challenged <UNK> or <UNK> positions in the media .
"as far as i can see israel is an open and free society , who <UNK> every point of view , which includes anti israel arguments ."
what ’s the big stink here surrounding this little girls communion you might be asking yourself ?
"i mean , come on ; it ’s rice instead of wheat for crying out loud !"
i must assure you that it ’s not communion that saves !
it ’s not even a particular church or religion that saves .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> us that the believer in christ can claim <UNK> life when jesus is received as savior .
""" how will he [ bush ] meet his god having <UNK> so many men and women ?"
oh and lets not forget president bush who had the balls to lead the way in <UNK> your country of that <UNK> ball hussein .
"<UNK> , i’m sorry for your loss , but that ’s the price you sometimes have to pay in order to be free ."
i know it ’s the “ in ” thing to do .
", you sure have a short memory my friend ."
"after the tragic events of <#> - <#> , the most asked question of myself anyway was why us ."
why attack the us in the most horrific way ?
"a <UNK> world power , because we’re a wealthy country ? was it because we represent ideas that are in conflict with the ideas of radical islam ?"
"<#> thing that did stick out at me , was that <#> of the <#> <UNK> were from saudi arabia ?"
and <#> percent <UNK> at <UNK> were saudi as well .
these people weren’t <UNK> on the west bank or <UNK> .
"these people didn’t grow up feeling some <UNK> towards the us or israel , because of the environment they grew up in either ."
they had grown up in a country that i thought was a strong ally in the arab world .
"the fact is that us troops were <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> , which are not considered “"
holy soil ” and us troops were never <UNK> there .
there was a message in the attacks on <#> - <#> .
"<#> was to the us , saying in a sense don’t ask saudi arabia to change , because if we change , this is what you’ll get ."
"second was a message to the saudi kingdom , saying , don’t"
"try to make changes because we radical <UNK> still have enormous power , and it ’s a destructive power , hence the twin towers crashing down ."
"third it was to the arab world , saying , don’t challenge our control over global islam ."
why should i be worried or concern about radical islam ?
"well , i’d bet before <#> - <#> , you probably never knew what islam was or who <UNK> was ."
did i start to understand and become concerned .
<UNK> is a doctrine of islam at its most extreme .
"it ’s the most violent , the most <UNK> , and the most <UNK> form of islam that exists today ."
"its form not only <UNK> out against the west , but also seeks to take over and impose a <UNK> <UNK> on the whole muslim world ."
<UNK> is alive and well here in the us .
islam was new to the us in the ‘ 80s and ‘ 90s and unlike other religions in the us islam didn’t have an establishment .
muslims arrived and just started <UNK> <UNK> in various places .
they represented an ethnic group that lacked structure to bring them together and <UNK> them .
"so the <UNK> decided to change that , by <UNK> american islamic <UNK> based on the radical <UNK> of islam ."
"by creating a set of organizations such as the council on american - islamic relations , they were able to speak for all of islam in the american media ."
<UNK> openly owns <#> of the <#> main <UNK> in the us .
i’d say that more than <#> percent of american <UNK> are under the control of the saudi government and <UNK> .
there are other influences of <UNK> in the us .
"second , the military , as islamic <UNK> in the military also practice <UNK> ."
finally are the many islamic schools here in the us that are directly supported by saudi money and preach the saudi <UNK> doctrine to us citizen muslim children .
support the federal and state governments in <UNK> islamic <UNK> in our country or communities .
support the fbi and the justice <UNK> and others who are <UNK> .
identify and support the moderate and patriotic muslims here in the us who <UNK> <UNK> .
"we should hold the media responsible for its coverage of these issues , instead of angry muslims blaming america ’s support of israel and other <UNK> factors . and"
"that ’s right my fellow bloggers , <UNK> is <#> huge <UNK> conference fan and an even bigger university of tennessee fan ."
so expected a lot of college football blogging in the months to follow .
the schedules for the top teams are so brutal that it will make a repeat of the national championship almost impossible .
i can’t forget that teams as <UNK> as <UNK> last year and georgia in <#> both had an sec loss .
and back - to - back <UNK> in the peach bowl
"isn’t setting too well with me either , and i’m puzzled how that can happen after beating teams like florida and miami on the road !"
"i’ve said this year every year so far and it seems to be a <UNK> , but this year will be <UNK> ’s year ."
"it has to be , i mean , it ’s about time all that <UNK> talent over the years starts to pay off ."
"leak , ot <UNK> and <UNK> ’s <UNK> , houston and j. davis , they have to come through this year !"
this is an sec title <UNK> team if everything <UNK> .
"so don’t be shocked if it does , with all the <UNK> hype around georgia and <UNK> ."
"w/ <#> home games in the second largest stadium in college football , should help ."
"in my mind , i’ll be happy with an sec title and a good bowl game win ."
"this is the key game , <UNK> wins between the <UNK> and <UNK> runs the table ."
stay tuned to more exciting <UNK> <UNK> news !
"the iraqi government has in the past put a death <UNK> on al - <UNK> , and they need to make good on their words ."
"<UNK> is bright enough to understand the risks of attacking the <UNK> , but the risks of doing nothing while al - <UNK> <UNK> armed <UNK> are far greater ."
"apparently <UNK> a homosexual in sweden will get the <UNK> a month in jail , but here in the us the man wouldn’t get sent to jail over it ."
the worst it would do is get a few liberals crying on the left and <UNK> for the truth on the right .
"i find this odd since about anything goes in sweden anyway , but <UNK> a homosexual in a church sermon is a crime ?"
it ’s just <#> more reason why the european superior attitude towards the us is so wrong .
"the <UNK> ’s stated mission is to put christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit , mind , and body for all ."
"but congress may by a vote of <#> - <UNK> of each house , remove such <UNK> ."
<UNK> traveled to <UNK> and <UNK> our <UNK> and provided aid and comfort to the enemy .
"<UNK> who <UNK> take actions during <UNK> that damage <UNK> and <UNK> the military are <UNK> and should be arrested , <UNK> , or <UNK> ."
"with all the recent <UNK> swirling around john kerry ’s vietnam record and his post - vietnam adventures , i just can’t keep my thoughts <UNK> any longer ."
"so without further a due , this will be the first of a series of posts that will expose this liberal left - <UNK> for what he really is ."
kerry can easily clear these <UNK> up if he would just release his complete military records .
real war heroes take offensive when someone uses the term loosely as has kerry .
"and btw , these <UNK> weren’t just discovered overnight either ."
kerry has been labeled a <UNK> long before he came on the campaign scene and his lies are well <UNK> .
"<UNK> the author of the book <UNK> for command , has <UNK> kerry for over <#> years ."
so this is nothing new to the vietnam veterans community .
a war hero doesn’t carry the <UNK> water either .
"kerry met with the north <UNK> representatives in paris , france and delivered requirements for an <UNK> surrender to the senate in <#> ."
"now , may i remind my fellow bloggers that kerry was still a <UNK> officer in the united states <UNK> reserve when his actions were <UNK> of an officer ."
"it ’s <#> thing to be passionate about an issue , but john kerry carried it a little too far ."
"according to this news story out of orlando , florida , linda <UNK> was fired from her job for eating “"
"in an interview with the ceo of rising star , <UNK> <UNK> , he states that his company <UNK> anybody ’s religion and not just islam ."
how can <UNK> make a statement as such and fire someone for eating meat the muslim <UNK> “ <UNK> ” ?
"the <UNK> says that muslims are forbidden from eating pork , not <UNK> or christians ."
a further study of islam will reveal why <UNK> statements are <UNK> .
it ’s time america wakes up and comes to grip with reality .
the war we’re engaged in is a war against islam .
"yeah , it may be called the war on terror , but where do these terrorist get their standing orders from ?"
"i think college football news is pretty accurate at guessing <#> - <#> for the <UNK> , with the <UNK> test coming between the <UNK> ."
"me , i 'm going to predict a little bit lower , <#> - <#> ."
"the <UNK> are gonna need alot of breaks to win that game , i expect ."
"if i had to pick a loss this upcoming season , this would be the <#> - <UNK> is good ."
"<UNK> should be another fierce game , but i 'm excited about this brief return to the <UNK> of old ."
just the mere word brings up emotions in tennessee fans .
we all want to see the <UNK> <UNK> the tide from <#> end to the other .
"it 's war every time the crimson and orange meet , but with all the other stuff going on , this year 's event should be quite an event ."
is this coach <UNK> able to stop the <UNK> march to taking over that series lead ?
"ole miss worries me , especially on the road - the <UNK> have n't had to cope with playing against someone who knows them as well as david <UNK> ."
"i expect this <#> will be <UNK> than expected , but the <UNK> should win if they do n't shoot themselves in the foot too many times ."
"i think this will be lou 's <UNK> , so this could be <UNK> than expected ."
this is <#> halloween scare we do n't need .
"they drive me nuts at times , and often i find myself a lonely voice of reason among a chorus of "" the bible tells me so . """
"okay , i really try to be a ' live and let live ' kinda guy , and they are welcome to their religious traditions ."
"the problem is that we are living in a time now where religion has become a factor in defining public policy , and in a very public way ."
"it 's almost like having a "" jesus filter "" on everything !"
"i know i certainly prefer a "" keep it to yourself "" approach to religion ."
"<UNK> public policy should not be <UNK> by any specific set of religious <UNK> , but should be determined by the greater common good ."
"hello - this is my first post from the "" peoples republic of <UNK> park "" , or "" <UNK> park "" as i like to call it ."
"great little progressive town , very gay friendly ( important ! )"
and certainly a place i like to call home .
"i 'm originally from <UNK> , tennessee - still a loyal <UNK> but glad i escaped the bible belt ."
"it 's a good place to be from - <UNK> word "" from ."
"today 's topic , since it 's my first post , is the us economy ."
how sharp a turn would a republican <UNK> make ?
"the intelligence failures are partially to blame on a republican controlled congress - the congress always holds the purse strings , regardless of who controls the white house ."
"i have yet to hear "" who cut the budget for the intelligence services , and why ? "" asked of the congress ."
urllink dragon this the sort of thing that makes you want to buy a nice pint for the urllink person who turned you on to it .
if you are lucky enough to have a urllink killer local radio station you may recognize the song .
i was shocked to find how buried in the dust it has become .
"if art is communication , then this succeeded on every level and did it with style !"
the film was shot on the <UNK> <UNK> over a weekend . '
<UNK> of love ' features an appearance by <UNK> <UNK> ethan <UNK> ( <UNK> ) .
"why not , say after i have achieved some great goal or have a <UNK> of <UNK> import to share ?"
notes to self to follow up on when time allows ( another joke ) .
bleeding heart <UNK> about things that didn’t go my way .
<UNK> happy dances about things that make life better . and
perhaps because i was at urllink jo <UNK> ’s site yesterday and it shook something loose .
"i would not call it down per se , but dull ."
i just don’t feel like my <UNK> usual self .
the $ <#> i spent to get my computer fixed could be a factor .
"yes , it could be that after the first $ <#> i was told the system would work great . wrong !"
i was going to buy a <UNK> bed ; instead i got to buy computer parts i had already paid for .
i try to keep my emotional baggage light <UNK> to retain only <UNK> of the lessons learned and mistakes needing no <UNK> variety .
"my <UNK> from the aforementioned error in judgment was that you can love someone very , very much but be absolutely <UNK> and therefore miserable with them ."
i didn’t find out that he had stolen from me until after we had parted .
"i miss his cat a lot and hope she is okay ( fade out <UNK> , cross fade in happy <UNK> ) ."
enough time has passed that it is time to have a go at the love thing again .
"after all , i enjoy time spent with my friends who are couples and i feel genuinely happy for them ."
"i am optimistic that my baggage is in fact , quite light ."
yesterday i got an answer to a <UNK> ad i responded too .
worst case scenario : life when it ’s your face hitting the pavement and he says something like : you have got to be kidding .
you’ll need it . which did i get ?
"okay , yes my friend ’s band was playing at blake ’s in <UNK> last night and i <UNK> had already planned on going ."
"heather , <UNK> and <UNK> of urllink secret <UNK> were their usual <UNK> , entertaining and adorable selves ."
"i am just an art student so i am in practice , practice , practice mode ."
"being so bloody new and <UNK> , i am therefore quite <UNK> about my work ."
"i also went to see <#> of the other bands , having heard good things about them and having met <#> of the members a few weeks back ."
that first night he had been quite nice and he chatted me up .
"thought i would ask him out for coffee sometime , i <UNK> night"
"he <UNK> second verse , same as the first ."
"he looked at me like all bay area people do when you say hello , as if some <UNK> social <UNK> pas had been committed ."
then he avoided all interaction - but not just with me mind you .
"i am an <UNK> and far too good to be bothered with you <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> of my <UNK> attitude ."
he certainly presented a very different and utterly <UNK> person compared to the <#> i had initially met .
and i am starting to wonder which love <UNK> i have pissed off .
yet it was an absolutely fabulous time out .
"in addition to urllink secret <UNK> who put on a great show , i would like to t <UNK> urllink <#> oh <#> for <UNK> marks ."
it is just fantastic ! all throughout this tasty bit of independent cinema i was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face and my sides hurt .
"this stuff is <UNK> cool , beyond silly to the point of sheer brilliance ."
i just found out from heather that the serious fun started shortly after grandma dragged her sorry <UNK> home to bed !
<UNK> urllink <UNK> nasty worked the crowd into a right frenzy and i missed wild cape dancing and co - ed <UNK> spanking !
"people , i love to dance , especially silly , <UNK> dance ! and"
i missed it so i could make it into the office on time this morning .
the crown heights are playing urllink blake ’s this saturday .
i have <UNK> with them but have not seen them live . and
"since i just checked my email and there was the official <UNK> from ping himself , i guess i will get myself there ."
they are <UNK> out throughout the day <UNK> oops .
"if i live , i think i will sleep through the 22nd ."
"oh cool , the sun just broke through the fog ."
"i mean the real sun and the real fog , not my personal fog ."
"oh sorry , how rude , got to stop doing that ."
a start to my life as a blogger . and
"yes <UNK> , i already know this is not a real web log since is has precisely nothing to do with the technical <UNK> of the web ."
"but if it proves to be amusing to me and at least <#> other person , it will be worth it ."
found this urllink silly test in this urllink blog .
well this goes a long way toward explaining the little voices .
response to my personal ad is going <UNK> . <UNK> bad . and
"hell yes , it is making me <UNK> so forgive me if i get any of my sour grapes on you ."
"low to no response depending on the site and of those who do , i can tell that they are n't reading or just not <UNK> what i wrote ."
some are so far off the mark and so poorly written that i wonder how they manage to form complete sentences - let alone send email .
"if you have ever had a <UNK> ad and had to screen through the <UNK> desperate and/or obviously <UNK> , you understand my frustration ."
consider the time spent <UNK> and editing a clear and sincere introduction .
at least i do n't get the really sick <UNK> offers too much anymore .
"<UNK> , i do read what others write and i am not finding a <UNK> thing to respond to ."
well there was that <#> ad but he said my reading and <UNK> skills left a lot to be desired .
"while i am not letting my current lack of <UNK> keep me from it , it would be far <UNK> shared with someone special ."
what miracle caused him to suddenly find a conscience ?
"let us all send warm , fuzzy thoughts to the banking gods that the check actually <UNK> ."
i am very happy to have been <UNK> .
i am also deeply <UNK> by what for all <UNK> and purposes is an admission of his guilt .
it is also based on his life philosophy that anything he does wrong or <UNK> to someone else is okay because he doesn’t mean it that way .
that last part works if <#> is <#> years old and doesn’t yet know a good life choice from a <UNK> <UNK> when <#> <UNK> makes an honest mistake .
but not when <#> is a grown man who makes the same kinds of mistakes <UNK> .
"oh , my palm was itching again this morning just like it was yesterday afternoon ."
but i am expecting <UNK> checks for the computer parts i bought ( but did not all actually make it into my system ) .
then they said something that made me take notice .
i sat there <UNK> at the tv ... tell people the facts and they will know the truth .
they made a commercial to tell me this ! ?
over in the corner a <UNK> reporter staring at some copy suddenly looks as if a light has just gone off in his head .
"he stand on his desk and in a loud voice <UNK> to the news room "" people , listen !"
"if you tell people the facts ... they will know the truth ! "" ."
""" suddenly a man in a <UNK> shirt and tie stands and <UNK> , "" by god this man is <UNK> ..."
"bring everything you got on this concept , we might just have something here ! """
"well , i 'm glad to see that my local news now understands that if they tell me the facts , i 'll know the truth ."
"they want to be free to do what they want , when they want , to whom they want ."
but why does it have to be at the expense of my freedom ?
i just want to live my life the way i see fit .
"they want to eat in a smoke - free restaurant , great , find <#> , frequent that establishment , tell all your friends ."
you 'll have your cake and eat it too !
"that 's just <#> example , i 'll write about many more ."
i feel i must do this because i 'm getting so tired .
"i read the news , listen to people talk , and see what our <UNK> has become ."
"i do n't want to be living in this world of socialist vs. <UNK> , of left vs. right , of liberal vs. conservative ."
"they do n't care about you , they care about control , absolute and total ."
"i think there is an alternative , a sub - <UNK> , where you have more than freedom , you have liberty ."
"and hey , i wo n't force it on you ."
today was the first official day of school for the 7th and 8th grade .
so to celebrate we took them to a camp where we played games and introduced rules and procedures .
"there were several other women teachers going along , and <#> male teachers ."
i started to realize that the <#> male teachers were also the bus drivers .
thank goodness the ride to the camp was <#> minutes or less !
"not that i do n't like boys . but let 's face it , a whole bus load of 7th and 8th grade boys ?"
i saw things that will stay with me for a long time . all in all
it was really fun and i enjoyed getting to know the boys .
"so boys , i hope you do well in my classes , and thanks for letting me hang out with you ."
( and i really hope you let that poor frog go . .
it seems fitting that my first blog entry should be about the title .
"let me assure you , my suspicious friends , that there are absolutely no <UNK> involved with "" getting happy "" !"
the truth is that i have a theme for the year .
"it 's based on a biblical principle found in <UNK> <UNK> "" . ."
"<UNK> i have learned to be content in whatever circumstances i am "" ."
i have learned that there are going to be many things in this life that i will be asked to do for christ .
"some of them i will not understand , and some of them i will simply not want to do ."
"so , this is the beginning for a lot of things in my life ."
"it 's going to be a <UNK> ride , but i 'm already getting happy about it ! """
"but whatever things were gain to me , those things i have counted as loss for the sake of christ ."
anyone that has worked in the tech support business can tell you how <UNK> that job is .
"lets face it , our phone never rings with good news ."
"and the second line that s ringing while you are on the first line , well , that s not good news either ."
"in fact , that s just about what my job description was ."
.... there is a great parallel between being a technical support guru and being a mom .
i think the <UNK> is what kept me sane during that time .
"i was raised as a strong <UNK> "" take care of yourself "" type of woman ."
"i had my career , my <#> kids , my fancy house , my fancy car and my prescription of <UNK> ."
"( tick <UNK> , tick <UNK> , anyone hear the time bomb counting down ?"
"i never thought i could give it up , i knew no other lifestyle ."
"ok , to cut through the dramatic writings , here is where i am at today ."
i am back and forth with wanting to go back to work .
"the last <#> months have been so peaceful , everyone has commented at how rested i seem and at ease with life now ."
i 've enjoyed the slower pace and the change .
getting used to just living off of gd 's income has been hard .
especially with a teenage girl ( gg ) and all the expenses that come with that .
"but everytime i bring the subject up , gg and gb ( <UNK> boy ) start in with "" but mom"
", i like you being at home with us , you 're nicer now "" ( ouch . ) """
""" more peaceful "" , i did nt think i was that bad working in california and felt a little <UNK> for the harsh criticism ."
so <UNK> this decision to go back to work .
maybe i will just ride it out a little bit longer here at home .
"now the big question is , can i deal with the <UNK> of the daily <UNK> without going <UNK> or losing my brain from lack of use ?"
"there are things i can do like work part time , or take a <#> <UNK> contract with a tech firm ."
i am starting to play my flute again and look forward to joining <UNK> kind of music ensemble this month .
"but i think the real thing that is getting me is the <#> "" on - call "" business of being mom and <UNK> everyones needs ."
"that almost seems expected of me right now regardless of what that "" need "" may be ."
am i expected to put them behind everyone elses ?
"how are other "" moms in transition "" dealing with the issue of being new stay at home moms from high stress jobs ?"
i would like to see some responses for that !
"january <#> , moving in there is snow , and more snow and more snow ."
"i am still getting calls from the job i just left about on - going "" issues "" that did n't get cleared up when i <UNK> quit ."
that s the least of the things on my mind to get done now .
<#> ) register kids for school <#> ) buy another vehicle <#> ) learn to drive in the snow <#> ) get groceries .
"not only was i completely ( and literally ) out of my element here in idaho , i am out of my comfort zone too ."
all of our stuff was still packed in boxes in the garage .
"with no time off after we moved here , gd immediately reported to his new <UNK> and i was stuck at home to sort through it all ."
"at first the snow was <UNK> , to wake up each morning and look out the huge sliding window to see our new backyard <UNK> with new snow ."
"the dog loved it , the kids loved it , the cats had no clue what was going on and hated it ."
all skills we did nt have to <UNK> with while in california .
"fast forward , may <#> ok , we made it through the snow ."
now its time to make it through the heat .
this is something that i can handle ! right ? !
"except for being laid up for <#> months for a hurt back from pulling all the weeds in the yard , i am doing good ."
it is amazing how over grown this place can get in a matter of days .
i am late in <UNK> my first garden ever because of my back injury .
"but i did manage to get tomatoes , <UNK> 's , chili peppers , bell peppers and some <UNK> planted ."
so much has happened in the last <#> <UNK> .
it would take blog after blog to go through it all .
"needless to say , we have settled down nicely with some <UNK> and <UNK> and everyone seems to be happy ? ?"
"i like strong characters , that get under my skin ."
when i am reading a good book i can hardly put it down .
"i look forward to reading it , i get addicted to the book ."
"i get upset if i am disturbed , i put myself inside the book ."
"when i am reading , it is my personal time to get lost in the story ."
"my favorite books usually deal with females , struggling for happiness , independence , <UNK> , romance ."
<#> of the books i would be interested in reading would be the secret life of bees by sue monk <UNK> .
"i do not know much about this book , except that the cover has caught my attention at barnes and noble several times ."
it was on the best <UNK> list for a while .
the story has to do with a young girl growing up in the south being raised by her father .
i think this will be an emotional story .
rebecca by <UNK> <UNK> is another novel i would like to read .
i have seen the movie several times and enjoyed it .
i know by past experiences the movie rarely does the book justice .
this is story of a handsome <UNK> who <UNK> a young lady .
they return to his big english <UNK> in the country .
there the new wife lives in the shadow of his first wife who was quite beautiful .
the new wife is awkward and unsure of herself .
in the end i think she proves to be a strong character .
lovely bones by alice <UNK> is a novel i have been wanting to read for over a year now .
i saw the author on <#> of those morning shows .
she was discussing her book and how she had been raped like the character in the book .
i know this book deals with a young girl who is <UNK> attacked and killed .
she somehow is able to watch her family as they continue with their day to day lives .
i think this book deals with a lot of raw emotions .
these are my <#> choices not in any particular order of interest .
i think the <#> books listed will have strong characters and make for interesting reading .
"i assumed i would work , live , retire , and die in southern california ."
"i had traveled some , but i tend to be very settled in nature ."
"i like to know what i am doing the next hour , day , week , month and definitely the next few years ."
my husband was a military child and moved around and he is more adventurous than i am .
"after the <UNK> of my daughter , i began to feel a need to be with this little person all the time ."
"my <UNK> <UNK> , which i thought did n't exist were turned on like a <UNK> ."
my job took a back seat to this little creature .
i began to discuss being a stay at home mom with my husband .
"as much as he wanted this for me and our family , it was very difficult due to the high cost of living in california ."
not being deeply religious i began to pray about this .
my husband met this man through his job and had been in contact with him for a year about a potential job .
<#> afternoon i happened to be home when this man called .
i knew as i spoke with him he was calling to offer my husband a job .
"the new job would mean a big move , a move to north carolina ."
"something in my gut told me to do it , i had to take this chance ."
i have been in north carolina for over <#> years and i have no regrets .
"i have learned you ca n't plan everything , you never know where life is taking you ."
the main issue on my mind at the moment is whether or not to have another cup of coffee .
"i had a cup yesterday , and have had a cup today ."
"no , i will have a <UNK> of milk instead ."
"did n't do much , of course , but it is the thought that counts ."
"came home , went to the garden , dug up some carrots , picked an onion , and made <UNK> soup ."
"put a portion in the freezer , and have another portion for today ."
"tip : for <UNK> soup in the freezer - put it in a container first , cause otherwise it <UNK> over everything else ."
then seal the bag and pop it in the freezer .
"well , i think that really is enough of my ramblings for today ."
i slept well last night - <UNK> wake up until <UNK> ! ! !
! that is such an improvement - previously i have been waking at <#> .
i find it so interesting to see what people have in their <UNK> .
"i had wondered a while ago , whether it would be possible to live only on <UNK> produce from local <UNK> for a whole year ."
"hmmmm maybe <#> day , i will give it a go ."
"those are just a few of my thoughts for today , and i need to get myself motivated for a study day ... books all day today ! !"
no excuses ... <UNK> not <#> no <UNK> at all . ....
"well , it was an eventful day ! - well , as eventful as it gets ."
drove to visit my aunt - the journey was <UNK> by the unnecessary traffic .
"unnecessary , cause of a series of accidents round the <UNK> , long <UNK> etc ."
"but , i survived , listening to a combination of classic fm and radio <#> ."
"still , the end of a <#> year friendship ."
i ca n't believe it is so long since i last posted !
"my goodness , it must be at least half an hour !"
"i woke up at <#> this morning - that is quite late for me , as i have a tendency to wake up around <#> ."
"normally there is n't - ah well , never mind ."
"morning <UNK> have become a habit - whether it is with friends on <UNK> , or in the chat room ."
"recently , i painted my bedroom - white ! also , i <UNK> the wardrobe , and cleared out all the <UNK> ."
"a difficult task , but i am so happy to be here now - <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
"last night , i went out there to pick dinner - a little <UNK> <UNK> , some carrots and tomatoes and <UNK> to make a light salad ."
well - i have had a very good crop this year .
i have also eaten some of my own potatoes and onions .
this is the first time i have tried these .
the <UNK> has a more <UNK> habit than the others .
i will use it to fill the freezer with <UNK> and pasta <UNK> for the winter .
"the <UNK> tomatoes are good at <UNK> - stuffed with a mix of <UNK> ( to soak up the juice ) , goat 's cheese and <UNK> - delightful !"
the <UNK> is coming up well - this is the first time i have tried it - just <#> plants .
"then , this evening , i will sit and watch <UNK> ...."
"good morning to all my readers - well , that means me and maybe <#> other ."

... to say that i am pissed with dating and men in general .
right now -- i am so sick of dating and the <UNK> connect there - with .
michael is my first love -- that has somehow found his way back into my life again .
-- i'll admit it -- i found him . )
i always wondered just how my life would have been if i had a chance to be with him instead of my ex - husband ( <UNK> ! ) .
what it could have <UNK> 's also got me thinkin ' about what it could be if we were to get married .
"i am sooooo afraid that if we get married , that i will end up <UNK> ' out of school ... fat .... pregnant .... and miserable ."
"i am also sooooo afraid that if we get married i will end up <UNK> with happiness , pleased , excited , <UNK> , and loved to the <UNK> ."
it 's all due to that damned <UNK> on him later . ....
"cleaned , washed , arranged all day preparing for this surgery only hours away ."
my baby has clothes for a couple of weeks and <#> organized <UNK> .
"my mother has maps to daycare , hospital , wal - mart , <UNK> <UNK> ."
scott has a <UNK> ' to do ' list .
"everyone said dinner was good and the carrots to shield the chicken from the grease was n't a bad idea , but my dad ate them ."
just before the midnight <UNK> i had my last <UNK> to wash down <UNK> for the <UNK> ( new <UNK> ) and <UNK> for pain ( old cramps ) .
( wireless networking in the bathroom rocks ! ) i will spend the remaining hours watching a movie and <UNK> my hair .
i 've missed my ' morning before breakfast ' of an egg and slice of toast .
"my stomach 's tossed about and at that time ( around 6:30 ) i was up , but feeling like even <#> <UNK> egg would n't stay put ."
i 'm <UNK> to try to battle the <UNK> with <UNK> tea .
the rest of this day 's meals are clear <UNK> .
"today 's <UNK> are health and personal tasks , mostly family - related , i would say ."
coming back home to some order after surgery will feel well .
i would like to have all my baby 's clothes washed and arranged so getting her up and ready for daycare will be easy .
i think i 'll cook a lemon - <UNK> baked chicken and a veggie side .

<UNK> ( duh ! and is n't <UNK> written on the sheet they gave you <UNK> ? )
we just came back from a family outing to <UNK> .
<UNK> had <UNK> my chart this ( saturday ) morning and noticed a problem .
"i was n't dying or anything that would halt the surgery , but my last labs showed white cells and that would signal an infection ."
he wanted to call out an <UNK> to get a jump on it before the surgery .
"i really felt like someone , my crappy opinions aside , was looking out for me ."
i explained to him that i just overcome a horrible bout of pain caused by an ongoing <UNK> problem and i felt the infection might be tied to that .
"he assured me whatever the problem was , the <UNK> would help and they would continue it after surgery ."
i asked about <UNK> and if the lack of carbs would cause this condition .
he said <UNK> was a desired effect and its affects on the patient would be <UNK> .
i also asked about my blood sugar and he said the labs showed it was much too high .
he said they would watch it carefully and give me <UNK> if it was needed .
he added that i was <UNK> ( not much ) and the staff also would monitor that .
there 's a post further down somewhere that says my <UNK> were in a wad about having to go out of town to see an <UNK> .
let 's just say there 's still someone up there giving me what i need instead of what i want .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
a big mug of water with beautiful crushed ice .
"i tried sipping and it 's all gone and i 'm heading to my new <UNK> <UNK> for another cool , <UNK> <#> <UNK> of it ."
am i just noticing this obsession with ice water because i should n't drink this much at <#> time or am i just nuts ?
"with just a little more than <#> days left before the surgery , tonight 's <UNK> plate was the last solid food for a while ."
"after dinner , we headed out to start working on the post - surgery shopping list ."
the actual list was mia when we got to the <UNK> 's <UNK> section .
"we will get the list , make a few calls and try this again tomorrow ."
"all of sudden , i do n't feel as <UNK> as i did just this morning in the doctor 's office ."
i have some questions i have n't <UNK> ( or thought of ) and might swallow my pig - headed pride and call this weekend .
"in <#> last - minute step , i went to see an <UNK> who works with the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i expected to be frustrated , but instead was <UNK> by the small - town doctor 's office staff and an <UNK> <UNK> ."
<UNK> even passed the <UNK> trap of asking me if i was sure i wanted a lap - band instead of a <UNK> <UNK> .
i think those things are horrible -- work or fail .
it seems too drastic for my taste and situation .
i <UNK> it with a ' sentence ' than a procedure to help someone .
did anyone ever mention i have some strong opinions ?
"i do , but luckily i keep most of them to myself ."
i like that it 's <UNK> and <UNK> to a certain degree
". may not be the way i 've always put it , but that 's the civil , just of it and what really matters to me right now ."
"after a full day of testing , <UNK> and my final doctor 's visit with <UNK> surgeon dr ."
"karl <UNK> , i 'm not sure if i should get my head tested ( again ) or run in the other direction ."
<UNK> 's office - haha ! ) a <UNK> therapist and a <UNK> .
<UNK> : i think that this facility could use a shot of positive pr after taking it on the chin in the media due to <UNK> and <UNK> .
"i may have gone on about this a little too much , but i do that side effects :"
i got a little pale thinking about what can happen when everything goes right .
"this is no walk in the park ( good exercise , week <#> ) ."
i 'm most concerned with <#> issues that do n't involve food at all : water and hair loss .
i ca n't easily explain why hair loss bothers me .
"not that i spent lots of money ( or any some months ) on "" doing my ' do ."
""" i have a thick , <UNK> ( check your ethnic dictionary ) crop of dark , sometimes <UNK> - breaking hair ."
i <UNK> to do everything i could to keep my hair <UNK> with <UNK> e and maybe avoid this horrible side effect .
i do n't think i would take that well .
"practice for <UNK> at a later date , i guess ."
"even when i ca n't justify why a medical test is being done , ' <UNK> ' is enough to keep me happy ."
<UNK> 's got some neat <UNK> and a staff <UNK> in breaking down their function down to the last atom .
<#> <UNK> : the <UNK> therapist thinks that her kind are the most hated staff members to <UNK> a hospital patient .
"a fat patient 's <UNK> is first and foremost .... .... .... .... the <UNK> : <UNK> , boo !"
"that 's not what happened , that 's what i was prepared for and really started this session with a stinky attitude ."
"it does n't matter what a <UNK> surgery patient has heard , all is about to change ."
this <UNK> was armed with samples of my new best friends -- high protein drinks with almost no carbs and <UNK> with space - age <UNK> from venus .
"tasty , but some are a little too sweet ( yeah , duh ? ) ."
"i decided the rest did n't taste bad at all and if i needed them to live after surgery , they would be getting better each day ."
"i know i just <UNK> some "" 12th step to recovery "" some where ... so be it ."
got the missing piece ( la ) to the clinic 's web site .
i took my first look at urllink <UNK> and liked what i saw .
i was afraid that it would be <UNK> or ' happy ex - <UNK> folks ' goofy .
"i give it high marks ( after a good <UNK> of those <UNK> tags , hint ) and i hope you all will look it up ."
"just read this that someone posted on the os , is it me or does he mention <#> different releases here.. ...."
from ross <UNK> 's diary on his website : thought i 'd have a lazy sunday .
checked my diary and realised the person who does it has n't put any recent pictures up .....
he thinks the record company are <UNK> a dead horse and he 's had nothing to do with it .
he 's in london for a couple of weeks .
rock version of <UNK> ( or does he mean the above is a rock version of <UNK> ) <#> .
oh well feel better for the clean out .
did n't have the internet last night as hubby was messing with the <UNK>
", i felt so lost , i did n't realise how much i use it and <UNK> on it , have i no life lol ?"
"i 'm so glad it 's friday , it 's been the longest week of my life ."
<UNK> ........ my friend just phoned to see if i want a <UNK> night out tomorrow night ....
"you bet i do , <UNK> <UNK> baby it 's <UNK> ! ! ! !"
i woke up this morning feeling really depressed ... dunno why .
"last nite b4 going to bed , i prayed to god for me and him ... hoping that everything wud be fine with us <#> day ."
i prayed for god to give me a sign .
then i dreamt that he was with me and we were about to catch a plane somewhere .
"me n my boyfriend , we 've been <UNK> for <#> years ."
i live here in singapore and he lives in new york .
"all the time when we 're apart , i feel so ' apart ' from him ."
"people ask , why do n't u both get married ."
"well , i guess god is not allowing that to happen yet ."
<#> months ago i fell into a very deep depression .
i was on anti - <UNK> and i can not stop crying for days .
my boss came to me at work this morning and ask me why am i so quiet ? !
he mentioned that he 's afraid to see me be so quiet .
i did n't respond coz i know that if i did i would break down .
i 'm doing things that people close to me wants me to do .
..... why is it so difficult for me to make such a decision ?
"firstly , i have to say the most depressing part of life right now is my job ."
"i hate getting up in the morning going to a job that i do n't enjoy , that i think is not fulfilling and meaningless ."
this job is full of politics and back <UNK> .
how can i stay long in such an environment ?
i know that most of you out there will tell me to leave but the money is <UNK> me to stay alittle longer than i should .
"i 'm now looking to do something that i want but i 'm lost and confused , dunno where to begin ."
a strange title for a blog i know .
"sexual , physical , emotional , or all <#> . sure enough in our group of <#> i know of <#> ."
"<#> guy ( yes guy ) suffered terrible abuse , and me ?"
"well , not that bad in context i suppose ."
"you are out with your partner , having a meal ."
"without any conscious intent , they put you down somehow ."
"could be over your choice of wine , what you are wearing , what you chose to eat or not ."
you are out to enjoy yourself and <UNK> that happens . or you are late for a party and your partner makes a comment about your <UNK> .
"if they are continuous , or the put downs are a stream , a flow of minor <UNK> ."
"i was abused on a sexual level too , but not sexually ."
"i wo nt go into it here , yet ."
"listening to others in the group discuss it like the <UNK> of a frog in <UNK> biology seems to <UNK> it , the suffering it can cause ."
"with that <UNK> , i too became small again ."
"a child , vulnerable and hurting deeply , with no - <#> to talk to , to take the pain to ."
"once again , at <#> , i had no - <#> to talk to , no - <#> to take the pain to ."
"so again , i had to sit and strip the emotional content from the issue , <UNK> it , <UNK> the feeling and myself ."
and then i wrote it down here . like crying in the night .
"no <#> to hear , or if they hear , no <#> to care ."
what we learn from the <UNK> to the grave ?
"as mere <UNK> in arms we learn what <UNK> faces are , we learn who our parents are ."
in that period of time we know that the world is them .
"we fear the loss of their love , as they provide everything we need , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"so in order to prevent that loss , real or perceived , we develop strategies , <UNK> , techniques in order to keep it ."
as children the <#> thing we need is to be loved for ourselves .
"it is this that allows us to develop our true self , our self esteem ."
"being allowed to make mistakes and learn from them , not <UNK> punished for any minor <UNK> ."
"being <UNK> , genuinely , for our <UNK> , being <UNK> just for trying , these are what we need ."
"if we continually fail , we are stupid , silly , <UNK> ."
how many times has failure become a terrible punishment in its own right ?
"<UNK> the bed becomes a <UNK> crime , <UNK> by <UNK> ."
its not seen as part of the development cycle .
"what of the parents who 's daughter was n't dry till <#> years , or even <#> or <#> ?"
their perception of failing to meet the norm becomes a failure of the child .
"silly thing set me off actually , claire goose getting killed off in waking the dead ."
"firstly in april an old friend died , <UNK> , of lung cancer ."
"he left <#> children , oldest <#> , youngest just <#> ."
"you see the loss of his family , feel it in yourself that apart of your past has gone ."
"did n't see him much in the latter years , always thought he would be around in the background . then a friend of mine lost her mother ."
"they laid on an incredible funeral , horse drawn <UNK> , the <UNK> , all the <UNK> of grief ."
"but who was it for , the <#> who was gone , or the ones that had lost her ."
"she was dead , so it held no significance for her ."
"it was , as ever , for those left behind ."
"last month , a neighbour , who has been around for many years , lost her <UNK> son , aged <#> , to an <UNK> on his liver ."
there the sense of <UNK> pain was incredible .
"friends and family , all <UNK> is death the only loss we ever have to suffer ."
"the greatest loss of all , so society thinks , is death ."
what on earth are you rambling on about ?
"when this does n't happen , slowly but surely parts of our self die ."
"you can be the skinny kid , brilliant at sport , or art , but quite poor at anything else ."
"you can be the pretty kid , the ugly kid , the smelly kid , the <UNK> kid or the bully ."
your <UNK> and failures are used to reward or punish you .
"everytime you hear the words "" why ca nt you be more like.. .... "" , they <UNK> you ."
that s what we are looking for . ourselves .
"the real self , that great potential <UNK> and <UNK> because it did nt fit with what parents or others thought ."
"the <UNK> new personality , denied and <UNK> until it dies , to be replaced with an empty , unreal shell ."
"people come into our lives for a reason , a season or a lifetime , so the saying goes ."
"once that season is ended , the reason met or the lifetime ended , once again we <UNK> for the loss ."
"loss of them for sure , but for once again , a loss of part of our true selves ."
"friends come and go , relationships begin , <UNK> and die ."
this is simply not <UNK> is our true self that is <UNK> can <UNK> it though .
if we can find the help to <UNK> it .
i do nt think i can see far enough inside to find the spark .
the effort of starting it all over again seems futile .
would i know what i looked like if i found me ?
so at last i have decided to join in the blog revolution .
it has taken me long enough i can assure you .
"i suppose a brief history of me , and why i am who i am ."
"i am fascinated by what makes up the rather <UNK> and <UNK> expression "" depression "" ."
the medical model ; the <UNK> model ; the <UNK> approach ; all of it .
it is partly a <UNK> of discovery for me .
most of my blogs will be concerned with this .
"i 'm a post - grad , middle aged professional , working and living in washington , d.c . ... and i love cars ."
i change my own oil and <UNK> my tires .
"i have <UNK> my car 's <UNK> , and i enjoy washing and <UNK> my car ."
i take my car to track events and i read car magazines .
this makes me a bit of a freak .
", i 'm supposed to view my car with great <UNK> , much like i view my <UNK> , or the <UNK> on my home ."
"being a car nut is for <UNK> , grease monkeys and high school <UNK> !"
"i do not need to explain my passion -- because as with any passion , it is not acquired with logical <UNK> , it just happens ."
"so , in truth , i do not know why i am passionate about cars ."
"cars are amazing technology , they are artwork , they are expensive , they are important , they are fast , fun and <UNK> ."
"as i get older and less concerned with <UNK> impressions , i have become more likely to confess my passion for cars ."
"sometimes i get a positive reaction ( from another closet car nut ) , sometimes it 's <UNK> ."
"with any luck , this will be the last presidential battle where the candidate 's service in vietnam has any <UNK> ."
"finally , vietnam will be behind us ( at least as a campaign volleyball ) ."
"this sunday the washington post ran an <UNK> detailed <UNK> of the "" incident "" in vietnam that has been the <UNK> point of the <UNK> campaign dispute ."
it shows kerry 's <UNK> to the minute !
the <UNK> of the debate is whether kerry acted <UNK> ( <UNK> of a medal ) or not .
"there is no doubt , however , that kerry was on that boat , in vietnam , taking enemy fire ."
"to me , an <UNK> voter , this is bizarre ."
<UNK> : kerry unit involved in <UNK> . ....
<UNK> : kerry boat hit by live fire .
"i 'm making up the bush activities , but there is nothing he could have been doing that would be more <UNK> than kerry 's actions during that time ."
"there are no facts , there are only statements ."
"it starts with <#> groups ( republican , democrat and <UNK> ) , and each of them has a definition of the other , <UNK> <#> ."
> the <UNK> of our economy and society .
> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> by human weakness .
> <UNK> to become associated with republicans or democrats .
> <UNK> ( aka selfish since the party base is among the elite ) .
"> offering safe harbor to racism , <UNK> , <UNK> and corporate interests ."
> <UNK> and scary at the <UNK> .
> <UNK> ( <UNK> the successful to benefit the <UNK> ) .
> pie - in - the - sky <UNK> .
> <UNK> and scary at the <UNK> .
"<UNK> as seen by republicans > lazy , <UNK> and/or <UNK> ."
"<UNK> as seen by democrats > lazy , <UNK> and/or <UNK> ."
"we used to dream of building mountains , and now we build <UNK> , and we 're damn proud of it ."
i 've lived in and around washington dc since <#> . despite this
"i have never worked in any branch of any government , and other than voting , i have not participated in any political process ."
the upcoming ( <#> ) election has been an <UNK> .
"for the first time , i care deeply about the outcome ."
"as someone with no investment in either political party , i am shocked at how the current political structure has co - opted <#> % of independent thought ."
"we actually have people who are proud to <UNK> themselves as "" <UNK> . """
"why force yourself to think , and measure and decide on difficult issues ?"
"whatever he says , i 'm with him ! "" pitiful ."
it 's like your personal view of the whole world has been <UNK> as peanut butter -- <UNK> or smooth .
"it is much more complicated than that , and i intend to face that complexity and arrive at my own conclusions ."
"i work with some of the <UNK> people in the world , and to see them locked into the "" <UNK> "" <UNK> is depressing and disappointing ."
the <UNK> camp will always be <UNK> because they do n't entertain any other <UNK> -- the same for the smooth camp .
"i support our troops , and i wish them success in their efforts to turn iraq into a <UNK> democracy ."
"i think it 's possible , and news of today suggests a ray of light in dealing with radical muslim leaders ."
"i also think it was wrong to have entered iraq when we did , and how we did it ."
that kind of thinking is not <UNK> in the <UNK> world !
"you 're a true believer , or a <UNK> !"
you can not <UNK> issues and take <UNK> positions !
"what is most disturbing about this is that a <UNK> , complex view is dismissed and <UNK> by the <UNK> and the <UNK> ."
"it 's too <UNK> , it 's not simple enough ."
it creates the possibility of common ground ! in requires someone to admit that they may have been wrong ! !
i 'm about <#> pages into this massive book .
"that <#> pages if it was in "" normal "" font with "" normal "" <UNK> ."
"so far , the themes are speaking to me loud and clear ."
"it has tremendous <UNK> to me right now , and to the <UNK> that i occupy ."
the questions is whether i will be able to make it through the book .
"the first person who <UNK> the meaning , origin or significance of the title of this blog wins this lovely car :"
my latest view on this subject features the strategy of <UNK> an athletes <UNK> with their ability to <UNK> ride the waves of their competitive storms .
"the second part of this equation is that the athletes actually need train on how to "" ride the waves "" of their sport ."
in every sporting event ( or every day for that matter ) numerous things get thrown at us that we did n't see coming .
the trick though is that you have to be looking for these waves and this takes practice .
from this discussion the athlete or team has a pretty clear picture of what to be focusing on over their next training period .
"so that my latest folks , compete with your <UNK> and ride the waves to close your performance gap and give yourself your best opportunity for success !"
as you can see by my writing that i write in a new language called : <UNK> .
we went to <UNK> <UNK> amusement park today .
"left late , dave ( not i ) drove and got up there at about <#> ."
we went right to the pool and spent most of what dave has set aside for the day .
"this was okay - our dinner was in the cooler - <UNK> with all the <UNK> , <UNK> and dessert ."
lunch - i got hungry and asked dave how much we have for food .
so i <UNK> my purse out of our locker and pulled up pocket change - about $ <#> worth .
i got myself a bag of chips and we stayed in the pool area for about <#> hours .
"dave had n't taken the <UNK> into the pool area , so elizabeth had to be held onto on the way to our car to get those picnic <UNK> ."
"dave suggested he run for the car , <UNK> it closer to the tables and i wait at the table with the girls ."
he came back about <#> minutes later <UNK> the cooler chest in the <UNK> .
on the way up he had turned on the lights for road construction ( the law here ) and had asked me to remind him to turn them off .
"so , now we need a jump - and have no <UNK> <UNK> to get <#> with ."
i pray - and he gets it going fairly <UNK> .
then he opens the cooler - no hamburger - none . and not much cash .
so - i pull out that pocket change and jenny and i walk back into the park and pick up the <UNK> dinner we can find - <UNK> .
"dave says <#> things went wrong , and that he did n't want to talk about that second thing ."
"we eat , we do the only thing we have money for ( thanks to dave 's <UNK> behavior , and $ <#> of tickets from old trips )"
", we hit a stand for coffee and <#> ( and only <#> ) cone of cotton candy - and go to the security hut ."
"really quickly we are in a service cart heading for our car , and on the road ( <UNK> packs their own portable <UNK> <UNK> ) ."
dave is falling asleep on the couch and jenny is trying to copy him .
anyhow - excuse my lack of knowledge here on computers - some site in this blogger journal thing looks like it 's a virus .
"so i logged out , ran my virus protection and i 'm good to go ( also - i dumped a bunch of cookies ) ."
but somebody needs to do something about this site - delete it maybe - that is acting so weird .
"that 's because i do n't have an addictive personality ; obsessive - compulsive , maybe , but not addictive ."
my father - in - law from my first marriage once took me to las vegas and gave me $ <#> in quarters to run through the slot machines .
"an hour later , he came back and asked me how much money i had ; i said <UNK> , "" <#> dollars . """
""" ah , that 's great , "" he said <UNK> ."
""" nope , i said , and showed him the coin rolls still sitting in my pocket ; "" i never broke it in the first place . """
he was much disturbed by this display of reserve and encouraged me to blow it .
""" it 's free and clear , "" he said ."
""" i gave it to you ; you 're not losing anything really . """
"apparently , i am an <UNK> in this direction ."
and you no longer have to go to the desert to place your <UNK> .
even in west virginia gambling has become an <UNK> <UNK> force to be <UNK> with .
the gas station just down the street has over a dozen different kinds of scratch - off tickets to consume your time and your money . and
"actually more of the latter than anything else , when you get right down to it ."
"it 's a <UNK> <UNK> : pay me a dollar , and maybe you 'll get a <#> in return ."
it 's the ultimate get - rich - quick scheme .
"and it works -- for the lottery commission , anyway ."
"personally , i 'd rather not throw my hard - earned money on another man 's game ."
"however , just on a <UNK> , i bought a <UNK> scratch - off ticket ."
it costs $ <#> and offers several different chances to win .
it lists a column of numbers down the left side ; and on the right side are several boxes of numbers covered up with grey <UNK> matter .
"you scratch off the boxes on the right to reveal sets of numbers that may , or may not , match the numbers on the left ."
"your cash reward depends on how many numbers you match up , and in what <UNK> ."
an experienced ticket - <UNK> can rip through <#> <UNK> ticket in about <#> seconds .
keep in mind that my mother is a <UNK> scratch - off ticket <UNK> .
"this is not only a gross display of poor discipline , but it 's rude ."
"they are blocking her way to the cash register , thank you very much ."
i thought maybe i should buy a scratch - off ticket on my own and see what everyone else was on about .
"the last thing i won was a <UNK> when i was in the 7th grade , and even then my brothers ate most the cake before i could ."
"on the way to the store , my son told my husband that he really felt i might have a problem . """
"no , "" my husband said , "" she does n't have a problem ."
they brought the ticket back and i scratched it off .
"this time , a smaller amount -- $ <#> , or <UNK> ."
""" i 'm going with you , "" he said ."
i brought him along to the gas station ( i felt like ringing the changes a little bit ) .
""" my mother has a gambling problem , "" my son <UNK> out ."
""" no , i do n't , "" i said , smiling calmly ."
""" i just want another ticket and the $ <#> , please . """
""" you see , "" my <UNK> said <UNK> ."
""" i really do n't have any idea what you 're talking about , "" i said ."
""" you keep trading in the tickets , "" he said <UNK> ."
""" i keep winning , "" i argued ."
""" that 's certainly why i had mine . """
that was the end of my scratch - off ticket <UNK> .
my husband still plays the <UNK> every wednesday -- the <UNK> drawing of numbers .
it 's a much bigger market and winning is extremely rare .
""" now i know why my mother keeps changing where she buys these things ."
just their casual examination and analysis requires a certain level of trust and surrender on my part that i simply do n't have .
so i do n't personally <UNK> the <UNK> dental cleaning .
"hey , i have somewhat of a obsessive - compulsive personality ."
no <#> is going to clean my teeth as well as i do .
"however , my issues with all things dental do not <UNK> to my children ."
"i took them to the dentist for their annual <UNK> feeling <UNK> , productive and , i 'll admit it , a little <UNK> ."
"dental appointments are the rite of passage of childhood , are they not ?"
who ca n't remember going to the dentist as a kid ?
"good intentions <UNK> , i had <#> <UNK> at my first dental appointment ."
"perhaps to <UNK> , i am a strict no - sugar parent ."
i do n't believe in candy and cookies for kids .
"eat it , fast , kid , before she comes back ."
""" some people have dogs under the table at <UNK> waiting for <UNK> ."
"i have grandparents down there , armed with toll house cookies and slipping <UNK> up under the <UNK> while i 'm passing the butter ."
"he proceeded to lecture me on the evils of sugar , and how much sugar actually exists in a can of soda ."
"obviously , after looking around in ted 's mouth he assumed that i was raising my children on <UNK> <UNK> and lemon drops ."
"i looked to my children to back me up on this , but they were much <UNK> by the red <UNK> balloons the <UNK> had handed out ."
"great , <#> more thing to bat out of my line of vision while i 'm trying to drive home ."
he did n't want the boy to feel <UNK> by his first dental <UNK> .
"no , it 's much better to gas him , i 'm sure ."
after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on other parents i have come to learn that the fitness of tooth <UNK> is as <UNK> as presidential <UNK> on foreign policy .
"not unlike the pill and other highly <UNK> forms of routine <UNK> , dental <UNK> is excellent , but somewhat <UNK> ."
some kids have <UNK> as <UNK> as a bicycle helmet .
others have teeth that <UNK> like bubble gum at the first taste of <UNK> .
"there really is only so much you can do , and the rest is up to the tooth fairy , or whoever ."
"though my kids do n't believe in the tooth fairy , either ."
that myth was <UNK> <UNK> when i wrote the oldest kid a check for the last tooth that fell out .
people always seem amazed when they learn i have <#> boys .
"sure , i would have liked to have a girl , but having boys is great ."
i took the boys to mcdonald 's yesterday afternoon .
i 've given up on that <UNK> to let my children experience random <UNK> .
the willingness to subject myself to routine <UNK> and public humiliation is not a <UNK> of my personality .
my kids eat in the <UNK> of my car better than they eat in the comfort of my own kitchen .
i have given serious consideration to serving all my meals in the car .
maybe it 's the seat <UNK> that make the difference .
it 's hard to refuse to eat when you 're <UNK> in .
"everyone else had a prompt response : "" the olive garden . """
"i had <UNK> twice i needed the boys ' meals , but still we ended up with girly - toys in the bags ."
"c'mon , even i would rather have the hot wheels car than a <UNK> pocket ."
my <UNK> <UNK> ( a verb he 's <UNK> to the highest art form ) that we ought to run over the <UNK> pocket as a form of protest .
i got back in the car and looked around ; the <UNK> amongst my children was <UNK> .
"i started the car and rolled it forward ever so slightly , then back again ."
i felt the subtle bump under the wheel as the doll got rolled .
i got out and picked up the doll ; nothing .
"<UNK> was perfectly intact , bearing only a <UNK> <UNK> on her left cheek ."
only my mother 's bread <UNK> are that <UNK> to the <#> - ton weight of a moving car .
"a discussion <UNK> about physics , plastic <UNK> and grandma 's cooking skills ."
"hey , that 's fun for the whole family ."
i once asked a nurse in new york with many children how she managed to teach them such good manners .
"her children seemed really <UNK> well <UNK> , even in restaurants ."
"at the time , i was still a college student and had no experience with which to <UNK> this information ."
"of course , i was the <#> who said i 'd never have kids ."
i did n't babysit when i was a teenager and only stayed with other people 's children if it was a true emergency .
not that i dislike children ; i love them .
"i still get excited about other women 's <UNK> , as long as they 're not my own ."
i imagine there are many men out there who say the same thing .
childhood is scary enough without <UNK> it on someone else . or
there are so many <UNK> to protect them from .
"no , anger was not an emotion i felt upon my <UNK> into <UNK> ."
he was never allowed to act like this in a store -- do i just love him less than the others ?
the more i refuse the more outrageous the demands get ; my young have not yet learned the subtle art of <UNK> .
"they <UNK> me , "" he is <UNK> as the clerk all but throws the book at me herself in self defense to keep ben at bay ."
""" i sign my name to the check and answer , "" who waits until dark ?"
"this sounds attractive , naturally , so i say , "" great , i 'll do that ."
"immediately the clerk and the <UNK> around me begin to <UNK> . """
"what , you 've seen my car ?"
""" i joke , and they just laugh harder ."
"i do n't understand the response , but then again , people have laughed at things i 've said before that i did n't find especially funny ."
on the way out of the store i stop to fill out the ticket for the drawing .
featured on the <UNK> is the car they 're giving <UNK> a black <UNK> <UNK> car for <UNK> .
<#> should be <UNK> of setting out to discover the truth ; it will almost <UNK> be a vicious animal .
"like <UNK> turtles and other wild game , the truth is best served up warm , with lots of extra ingredients to make it taste better ."
even more dangerous than seeking truth in all things is to risk going to the grocery store without any makeup .
"also , that would be almost asking to run into my mother , who would <UNK> in a <UNK> way , "" sharon ."
""" so i wash my hair and put on makeup , because you never know what could happen ."
he also feels it necessary to <UNK> me before i leave the house for any other toys i may have <UNK> for personal use .
"trust is not , perhaps , an <UNK> element in this family ."
"speaking of which , i remember to check my wallet before i get in the car ."
"my purse seems to operate as a sort of loosely managed bank for everyone else , with few <UNK> and outright <UNK> going on under my own nose ."
there are moments in a person 's life when they must stop and examine how it is they came to this particular station .
"these are serious questions , and i need to explore them ."
"the truth is a dangerous animal , and i feel too thin - <UNK> to go after it today ."
i believe miracles can happen to anyone if the expectations are low .
a penny in the street is a miracle if you 're willing to be grateful for the <UNK> of cheap currency .
these are the <UNK> on which i build my faith and hope in humanity .
"i was once a creative , inspired person who slept in until <#> a.m. and <UNK> <UNK> peace and joy to all who knew me ."
"sleep , i 've found , does wonders for the personality ."
"i am still creative and inspired , but am now tense and <UNK> with the attention span of a <UNK> ."
"is it the <UNK> of sleep <UNK> after <UNK> <#> boys , or the side effects of the coffee i swim in daily to combat the sleep <UNK> ?"
today i had an appointment to register the <#> - year - old for <UNK> .
"<UNK> is now the new kindergarten , and kindergarten is the new first grade ."
"in my day , kindergarten was a very comfortable <UNK> ."
"some group play , some mild <UNK> , and then down for a nap on your blanket ."
"upon waking , we were served cookies and milk , <UNK> on the head and sent home again ."
kindergarten now is an <UNK> of academic <UNK> and lessons in <UNK> .
a critical <UNK> of the difference between primary and secondary colors is preferred .
most of the <UNK> - olds standing in the hallway with us awaiting registration appeared tense and uncertain about what awaited them .
"<#> set of parents <UNK> in their son as he checked his steps , dragging his feet . """
"the father asked <UNK> , and the child answered with great <UNK> , "" i 'm not sure ."
""" the parents all seemed to know each other , and i did n't know anybody ."
"i was thinking , however , that if we 'd brought the youngest we would have <UNK> up the atmosphere considerably ."
these fine words of wisdom came from my husband 's lips last evening .
"he is growing up slowly , but every once in awhile he has a jump forward in the process ."
these past <#> days have been his latest leap .
"friday night he said to me , "" you see it sometimes in people who have severe drug addiction or <UNK> ."
i never finished growing up and i need to do it now .
"it is going slowly . "" what <UNK> to turn that cynical and <UNK> eye <UNK> ."
"oh , my god , i ca n't believe i finished them ! !"
"they are a tad <UNK> , but i think that is due to all the excess fabric from the <UNK> sleeve i <UNK> inside ."
then i can do away with the <UNK> - <UNK> and have a smooth line with a better fit . and that is a super easy addition to do .
last night the husband and i came up with what we think is a great idea .
"he wants to play , but has trouble maintaining an accent and a character , because when he talks , he drops right out ."
"i suggested that if his character did n't speak english , he could keep his silence and whisper into the ear of an <UNK> ( me ) ."
"i thought he did a bored , <UNK> look well , so i thought a high - born noble character would be good ."
i came up with an actual historical person : john iii of sweden .
"his mother was <UNK> <UNK> , father , <UNK> i of sweden ."
my thought is that he could be traveling with the <UNK> on his way to marry <UNK> 's sister .
"unfortunately , craig is <UNK> that any new characters be polish or <UNK> , so we may just make him a <UNK> captain , who is seeking my hand ."
i got a new sewing gig - making a <UNK> of the mary of <UNK> dress .
i wish i had <#> bucks to spare .
no writing over the weekend ; i may do some today if the <UNK> does n't break me . :)
"tomorrow is hubby 's birthday , and i have nothing for him ."
"oh , my god ... this morning at 6:00 i realized that these sleeves need to be done by tomorrow , not the 28th !"
i totally forgot about the dinner at uncle 's house .
* i went downstairs and did some major work on them .
"well , there 's always nap - time !"
i guess i still need to make the <UNK> .
i am dying to use the fabric that <UNK> got online -- the <UNK> <#> -- as it is so fantastic .
"* sigh * there are only <#> or <#> yards , so i will have to just make a short <#> with big sleeves ."
"as long as it can <UNK> into the <UNK> , it should work ok ."
the gold - wire <UNK> that i made to go with the murray dress is turning green on me .
i guess i have to retire it and find a different fabric that is super sheer ...
"i am sure i have something , just not sure if it is the right color ..."
it is a traditional storyline for a romance ... but i am going way beyond romance and all the way to hard - core sex ... yay ! !
"pirates , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , hidden <UNK> revealed ."
* sigh * makes me all <UNK> just thinking about it .
"i got the kitchen all cleaned up nice , have dinner already planned and halfway <UNK> ."
but <UNK> it all is a burning desire to write this story .
to get it on paper so it can <UNK> others as well .
well last night hubby and i went over to the neighbors and played the <UNK> game .
it was very fun and it helped me to expand my context .
she told me that she hired a rich dad coach .
i think it is so incredibly crazy that she is working the same plan that i want to work .
and i put her down as someone to talk to about it .
i think we can really help each other keep moving .
i think i still want to buy the game for myself .
it really did help me to expand my context .
i need to get my own <UNK> in order so that i know where i stand ....
well today i downloaded a couple of reports from urllink <UNK> and i also listened to the free <UNK> .
it focused mainly on buying and selling on the no money down thing .
i think that i want to focus more on building rental properties .
"i will continue to read the "" retire young retire rich "" by <UNK> and tomorrow we are going to play his cash flow game ."
i am excited to sit down and talk with <UNK> and bill .
i am on my way .... stay focused .
"<#> other thing , i also signed up to receive the newspaper everyday ."
i think that this will be a great tool for finding and researching properties and the market in our area .
i also need to find out about joining the chamber and attending city council meetings .
i want to find out about <UNK> on in this city .
"ok , so i have to write this out ."
during this process i have been reading <UNK> 's rich dad poor dad books .
well last tuesday i wrote down a list of people that i wanted to talk to about my plan .
i also wrote down that i wanted to buy the <UNK> <#> game from <UNK> .
well today i started looking for the game on ebay .
i book marked <#> different <UNK> and i was going to watch them to try to get the game for less than the retail $ <#> .
well tonight my daughter and i went for a walk and on our way back i noticed my neighbor was just getting home .
i stopped to talk to her and somehow we got on the subject of real estate <UNK> .
she has been doing a lot of research on <UNK> in commercial real estate .
i asked her if she had ever read any of the rich dad poor dad stuff .
she said ' oh yeah ' i have a lot of them and i bought the game .
well we are going to get together saturday and play the game and then go out to dinner .
she also brought me over the book that i could n't get at the library .
it feels like we are on the right track !
"boy what a day ! to take a day off to relax with <#> kids , what a not so smart idea ."
but they always seem to think that it is not quite enough .
today i got even older . and to relax on your own day .
ha ha maybe when i am <#> and then i will probably have <UNK> .
spoil the heck out of them and teach them nice new tricks and send them home .
ok so i have something to look forward too .
well do n't quite know where to start today !
i have had a busy few days and on top of that am not feeling <#> % so it will be a short <#> i am afraid .
i am delighted to have found somebody with a mindset that i can respect and hopefully draw on in the future .
"couple of things we covered : support from management in relation to ideas and different projects <UNK> has worked on , or lack of it depending on the situation ."
i certainly do n't expect any feedback or comments .
the <UNK> shared have been <UNK> and i am certainly keen to hear more to store away in my memory for future access when the need <UNK> .
"i am looking forward now to building on this , and especially since i have just discovered i have some small projects to deal with ."
hopefully my move to <UNK> in <#> weeks wo n't <UNK> our continued contact .
i even talk to mum about you and that 's pretty crazy cos she does n't really want to know .
"it 's nothing personal , she just has this amazing self defence mechanism which <UNK> her from the pain and the hurting that thinking about her past would cause ."
how anyone can erase their past from their memory without the help of <UNK> or some other medium is beyond me .
"i think it makes her quite cold as a person and sometimes i really <UNK> her , she can be so <UNK> ."
"you know , when i told her i was pregnant , she did n't speak to me for <#> months ."
i truly believed that i could n't have kids .
"after so many years of <UNK> sex with no accidents , to fall pregnant when i did was really amazing ."
"i 'm so lucky , i have a beautiful little girl who makes me laugh and cry all at the same time ."
i did n't think it was possible to feel such pride and love for someone .
i hope i 'm not such an <UNK> to her as mum is to me .
"god it really sounds awful that i 'm saying these things about mum , i love her dearly and so much want her to be happy and proud ."
i want her to have everything that you should have given her and more .
"she has been really great about some stuff , like when i sold up and went to meet your brother and <UNK> in the states for <#> months ."
"life can be so <UNK> , so easy to find a dead person on the net but it was impossible to find you before that ."
"i started to look for you when i was <#> , i had run away from home after another row with mum ."
we were in london visiting my step - dad at the time
"so it was easy for me , i just jumped on a tube into central london ."
"i remember it as if it were yesterday , it was a sunday and i was sitting on a bench on victoria street in victoria ."
i did n't have a clue what to do or where i was going to go
"but i was n't scared or nervous , just <UNK> and even a bit excited ."
i ended up staying there for just <#> nights because they started getting a bit <UNK> <UNK> with me .
"i guess i was lucky really , they did n't hurt me or anything , they just tried it on a bit ."

"simply put , i came across it while searching for something i never found ."
"<UNK> thrown around here and there , but never really knew what the heck it was all about ."
sure some “ <UNK> ” has written a ‘ blogging for <UNK> book by now and i can find it at my local davis <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> of me i have no intentions of following any <UNK> directions .
"rather , i intend to learn the <UNK> as i go ."
"i do this of my own <UNK> , and will most kindly ignore any directions from the well - intended ."
<#> exception : i will try to <UNK> to any kind of <UNK> that <UNK> didn’t raise no fool .
"that “ said , ” allow me to <UNK> a little about who i am and where i live ."
"as you may have guessed by now i <UNK> in the <UNK> of all country - <UNK> , missouri !"
no <UNK> mid - sized town can be found .
i can not stand country music . which is sad because it is pouring out of every <UNK> you pass in this town .
nor do i feel this way about all country music .
"i genuinely love the old country sound : <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> williams , ‘"
the junk they push off as country these days leaves me wanting more .
the ‘ <UNK> sound of much of today ’s country makes me feel as if i have just left a tiffany concert at the local mall .
"if any of the local writers are reading , i <UNK> you : “ please bring back some ‘"
"<UNK> sing about <UNK> and <UNK> and most importantly , being down on luck ."
"” i hear a train <UNK> <UNK> although it may read as such , i’m not really not all that cynical ."
i’m a nice guy just getting by the best i can .
"i love the city of nashville , its people , and the opportunity it has to offer some really talented folks ."
"so if you get a chance to drop by , do ."
check in here from time to time to get my latest <UNK> on nashville and my latest adventures .
thanks for taking the time to read my words .
"noble , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> in its pursuit of ..... poop !"
"eat it , roll it , collect it , sleep in it , raise their young in it ."
"now , do n't get me wrong , i do n't hate all people ."
"but as a species , we are failing . miserably !"
what creature on this planet has <UNK> its potential as much as humans ?
"we are greedy , self - centered , <UNK> and violent ."
"but most creatures are , or can be , simply as a matter of survival ."
"when any other species fails , it merely fades away , becomes <UNK> ."
"when we fail , we cause other species and other people to <UNK> , fail , or die out ."
"now , the <UNK> <UNK> ..... there 's a creature i admire ."
"but they love it , it 's what they do ."
i 'm sure they 're not even aware they 've got the worst job and living conditions on earth .
but they are happy and fulfilled ( i think ) .
"let 's imagine we can peer into a brief moment of a family of <UNK> <UNK> ; <UNK> <UNK> dad : "" honey , i 'm home . """

now let 's look at the <UNK> that dr .
"the group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> commitment ."
"the next time you attend a major function or rally , take a good look at how <UNK> is treated , referred to , etc ."
"the "" system "" teaches you to <UNK> your <UNK> ."
"it teaches you to not question your <UNK> , because according to the system , your <UNK> is always correct ."
the group is <UNK> with bringing in new members .
"just look at how much money is truly in the "" system "" ."
how much does it cost to <UNK> a <UNK> ?
how much does it cost to <UNK> a cd ?
how much does it cost to <UNK> a <UNK> video ?
why does a <#> cent tape cost $ <#> ?
why does a $ <#> video cost $ <#> ?
"questioning , doubt , and <UNK> are discouraged or even punished ."
do n't pay any attention to the junk written on the internet ...
what 's the fastest way to lose a friend in the <UNK> business ?
i 'd call that a punishment ... especially if you were close .
"some will , some wo n't , so what , next ."
how about a sing - a - long ... on the cover of the <UNK> ( or whatever it 's called <UNK> ...
how about this ... show the plan ... show the plan ... show the plan ...
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ...
if you are a woman you need to be dressed in a conservative business <UNK> ( no short skirts ladies ) with low to medium heels .
"if you 're a man , you 'll take control of your <UNK> from your wife , because men are meant to lead their families ."
it does n't matter if your wife is an <UNK> .
it 's your place to lead because you are the man .
( and no i 'm not a feminist )
"my <UNK> is better than your <UNK> . "" who 's your diamond ?"

... why does the sunday meetings always have a church service ?
"i 'm not religious at all , but was made to feel guilty because i did n't attend these <UNK> meetings ."
why is <UNK> trying to convert the vast population of the world to christianity ?
"the group has a <UNK> <UNK> versus - them mentality , which causes conflict with the wider society ."
"if you look at the way that <UNK> is treated by <UNK> , it 's obvious that he is feared by <UNK> ."
what would <UNK> to <UNK> 's business if <UNK> quit and decided to start his own <UNK> company .
he has been running an illegal money scheme ( the system ) for years and <UNK> has known about it all along .
so does <UNK> hold <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for his actions ? obviously not .
why do n't people just come out and tell you that they are trying to <UNK> you to the <UNK> business ?
"because if they did , you would n't join ."
"the "" <UNK> approach "" is both <UNK> and <UNK> ."
the leadership <UNK> guilt feelings in members in order to control them .
i could write a book about this <#> statement alone .
how many times have you been made to feel guilty because you would rather spend a little time with your family than go out and show the plan ?
what about the guilt you feel when you know that you are n't showing the plan enough ?
what about the guilt your <UNK> forces on you when you tell your <UNK> that you ca n't afford to purchase the books and tapes anymore ?
how many friends have you lost because of your <UNK> with <UNK> 's organization ?
members are expected to devote <UNK> amounts of time to the group .
""" you will discover that all of your true friends are in the <UNK> business "" ..."
"... "" it 's not the money you make , or the fancy cars or houses that are important ."
"it 's the relationships you build "" ... ..."
""" all of my friends are in the <UNK> business "" ... and"
hundreds more statements just like this are only a tape away .
in summary i leave it to yourself to decide whether or not <UNK> 's system created a cult .
"just remember , the choices you make now can change your life for the better ... or the worse ."
all i ask is that you put aside the system training for <#> minutes and think about what i 've written here with an open mind .
"decide for yourself whether you want to be involved with this "" system "" ."
doing the same thing year after year and expecting different results .
this only really makes me want to ask current <UNK> ’s
"<#> <UNK> if you’ve been working the <UNK> business for over <#> years and you still haven’t gotten to <#> <UNK> ,"
don’t you think it ’s about time that you listened to the diamonds ?
the <UNK> organization <UNK> a <#> - <#> year plan to success .
"if you haven’t achieved even <#> <UNK> after <#> years , take a good long look at your business ."
it ’s possible you need to work a different plan .
"urllink <UNK> today dave of <UNK> today has a great article on his blog titled "" <UNK> - history , science , or art ? """
"i highly recommend that you read this article , and apply it to your business ."
it all comes down to <#> thing in the end ... you .
for almost <#> years i listened to this ( <UNK> )
so much that it became <UNK> in my habits .
so what happened when i left the big a and moved on to another company ?
"i would tell my new <UNK> that to be successful they had to "" get out of their comfort zone "" ."
"people do n't like getting out of their comfort zone , and they will avoid anything that causes them to do so ."
how can i build a business without getting out of my comfort zone ?
use the <UNK> of advertising methods that you feel comfortable with .
"try something simple like handing out business cards , flyers , local newspaper ads , etc ."
all pointing to a website that does all the selling and <UNK> for you .
"put your phone number on your site , so people can call you ."
let today 's technology weed out the people who are n't looking for what you 're offering .
"your comfort zone can be an incredible strength , use it well ."
a friend asked me yesterday what i thought about buying leads .
"i gave him my standard answer and attempted to give him my reasons , even though i was too tired to be completely <UNK> ."
"personally , i believe that buying leads of any kind ( email , phone , etc ) is a complete waste of your advertising budget ."
unless you are looking to become a phone pro ... and if that is your goal ...
"don't buy leads , just pick up the phone book from any major <UNK> area and start with the letter ' a ' ."
here 's the short list of low and no cost advertising : google <UNK> - low cost and effective .
"you 'll also learn some important skills , such as writing headlines , writing ad copy , and <UNK> your audience ."
business cards - the single most under - rated and powerful form of advertising that you can perform <UNK> .
your goal should be to pass out <#> business cards every week .
"local <UNK> newspaper classified ads - there are thousands of small newspapers in the us that are published weekly , bi - weekly , and monthly ."
"they are usually significantly cheaper than advertising in your local newspaper and depending on the paper , may be more <UNK> as well ."
"<UNK> car signs - if you drive any distance at all , these are very effective at getting the word out ."
flyers - cheap to print and effective if well written .
"you can hand them out , post on supermarket <UNK> boards , etc ."
"there are literally hundreds of ways to market your business that are , in my opinion , more effective than cold calling ."
pick up any of the <UNK> marketing books and you 'll get even more tips .
and that 's what this is ... a first step .
i 've lost count of the number of different companies that i joined in the previous <#> years .
"after really looking at the background and personal history of the "" heavy <UNK> "" ( oh how i hate those words ) , i realized <#> simple fact ."
they were actually committed to making a success of their new business .
and this is where i as a network marketing <UNK> failed .
i failed to make a <UNK> to any of the businesses i was involved with .
i failed to commit to working the business a specific number of hours each day .
i failed to make a <UNK> with my <UNK> .
i failed to make a <UNK> with my <UNK> .
i failed to make a <UNK> to myself .
"i made a <UNK> to myself , that no matter what , i would never fail to be committed to my business again ."
am i looking for the perfect network marketing opportunity anymore ?
i 've made a <UNK> to the business that i 'm involved with .
there is nothing in this world that can stop someone who is committed to achieving their goal .
"well i missed friday , due to a heavy afternoon session on the beer after work ."
"a classic example of this was the ex landlord of the <UNK> , a <UNK> called ken <UNK> , but enough on him ."
"and the other thing about these <UNK> is the fact that when you walk in , a stranger you get that silence ."
"then it all starts up again , leaving you on your own ."
"deep fucking joy , and i have noticed how <UNK> these <UNK> are , god help anyone who 's an ethnic minority who walks in there ."
a massive piece of waste to put in <UNK> .
"it opens up on the hour , and is a total <UNK> to the town , sorry city ."
the war memorial in john <UNK> square is also an insult .

"yeah right , the top cats get the money . and"

an sorry guys a few lessons sitting down watching <UNK> ai n't going to cut it .
india is outside the eu and has no data protection act .
that 's ok argue the companies your info is safe .
"i know people over here make mistakes to , but there have already been cases of employees in india etc selling bank details and other data to third parties ."
"several companies realise it 's just done for cost reasons and is not secure as they claim , and are happy to support the uk ."
"you have a problem in this country , you can drive to the office to see someone ."

"they were as , or even more , freaked out as i was ."
"for quite some time after , months even , i thought i might actually get a call back from them ."
denial - it 's what 's for dinner .
"i was gone , toast , history , but still hanging on to the hope ."
"they paid me double the legal amount it costs to let someone go without notice , and were done with me ."
"i had some cash , and <UNK> coming , but i had to get a job eventually ."
"so i thought , hey dude , you got 's some serious experience there , go see the competition ."
"how did i get here . not a question , a statement of dis - belief ."
"i worked for a security company , for <#> years , first in the field as a guard and then in the office in various roles ."
i could and by all <UNK> the powers that be were very happy with my work .

the <UNK> wanted more profit in a very short time so myself and
"<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , position - made - <UNK> , no matter how they slice it - fired ."
using a buzz word just made it legal to let a couple dozen people go without cause .
"unfortunately , when you work for only <#> company for so many years moving on is n't all that easy ."
you find your contacts are useless ( everyone you know <UNK> with you ) and your job skills are fairly <UNK> to that <#> company .

i m good at just letting things go and following through about a month later ! !
"nothing like seeing your partner truly happy in what you do , your touch and kisses , the way you share that intimate part of yourself !"

i am begging my lord for this doctor to be wise and compassionate
"<UNK> . , so maybe i am <UNK> too much ."
i speak to people about the physical pain that i endure .
"i see "" blank "" eyes , looks of <UNK> , of confusion !"
"i can not imagine looking at someone spilling their soul from pain , and looking at them without the greatest amount of <UNK> compassion and <UNK> ."
"we live in a busy world , a place where we just do n't have time for other people anymore ."
i know that i have had times in my life when i have been too busy to be there for others .
i am just so lost and empty from the lack of concern i get from people ....... even when i ask .
"i can guess that until i can eliminate the pain , i will <UNK> to have problems with this emotional behavior ."
everyone in the medical and mental health community will continue to pass the ball back and forth until it is too late for me .
i really do n't want it to be that way .
"contrary to popular belief , i find great joy in life ....."
....... i will have to see how it goes ...
i have been <UNK> with pain for so long that i do not even know who i am anymore .
i want them to know how badly their lack of judgement has affected my life .
"i want to know what it is that they see when they look at me that makes them see a "" <UNK> "" woman ...."
i <UNK> would they behave with extreme pain <#> ? ? ? ? ? ?
"<UNK> guys , gals , <UNK> and those who just pass through ."
so for right this moment i am going to push that thought ( cheating ) to the side and
when we are on a first name basis again i will tell him of my <UNK> .
it 's kinda hard to talk to him when we are n't talking ... lol .
it really bites big time that everything i see reminds me of or makes me think about sex !
maybe my hormones are a little too good considering the state of my relationship at the moment .
( now is when i need to go hunting for some of those little <UNK> faces you can use in your blog ) .
so i 'm at the <UNK> today dropping off some paperwork that i pulled out of my ass by the way .
like i know how to write a response to a civil <UNK> without a <UNK> .... right ! !
just a hearing with the ex about child support issues .
""" i do n't know what does . what the hell is up with kids these days and what s up with wanting everyone to see their underwear ? ?"
we all have them and most of us do n't want to see yours .
so anyway ..... a good day for the most part .
"my papers are filed , my husband is actually in the house and he even went to the store and before he left he asked if i needed anything ."
i have tons of stuff to get done and ... get this ! !
.... have i already said that i appreciate the input ?
":o ) geez , it sounds really bad when you say "" i should n't kid about a divorce "" ."
"i really was n't kidding about it , if things did n't look up in our relationship i was going to pay a visit to my lawyer ."
"just mentioning that the thought had crossed my mind was taken as a threat by c , and a threat he felt he needed to act on ."
i think maybe i did mean it as a threat and jsut did n't realize what his reaction to that would be .
i know i said i was <UNK> about the divorce ... and i was !
i made a few calls today about a part - time job .
", but first things first ( i 've been putting this off way too long now )"
i 've got to get <UNK> in classes so i can give them my school schedule to work around .
i 'll let y'all know what comes of that .
in response to the questions in the comment section ........
"<UNK> thanks for the input and making me look at other options and making me think outside of the box , all appreciated )"
why did c change his mind and stop the divorce <UNK> after getting to iraq and missing me i <UNK> .........
<UNK> only talked after he had been gone almost <#> months )
"i never claimed total innocence in this relationship , i only claimed to not know what i actually did this time ."
( maybe i am more naive than i realize ) and # <#> i do n't think he would believe her anyway ........ he knows me .
"... he wo n't even look me in the eye , he just rolls his eyes and pisses me off which makes matters worse ."
not sure how many ways there are to get a man to talk but either of the above would have worked for me .
as for the being self <UNK> comment .............. and do n't think i 've taken offense .... i have n't at all !
i have always played a major <UNK> factor in this marriage .
"in fact , he lived with me when we first got together and i paid all the bills ."
our money only started being in individual accounts after he filed for divorce last year and it just seemed more convenient that way
seems pretty <UNK> to me when combined with the rest of the circumstances .
he came in again this <UNK> around <#> pm and the same thing ...... stood at his truck drinking .
"it will only be a matter of time , i 'm sure , until someone in the <UNK> association has something to say about this ."
again ........ not a single word spoken between the <#> of us .
maybe i am being hard headed here but i have tried on numerous <UNK> to get him to talk to me but i am not going to beg .
i tend to always see the worst in every situation .
"who <UNK> ..... maybe i am seeing far more into this problem than what is really there , maybe i am letting the little things turn into big things ."
maybe i am letting my imagination get the best of me .
"i married "" c "" knowing that he had cheated on his former wife"
", why did i think i would be any different ?"
"i 'm growing tired really quick of how things are going in my and "" c 's relationship ."
"which i 'm not obviously and obviously neither is "" c "" ."
so why spend years or months trying to fix something that may not be <UNK> .
we have been growing apart for quite some time now
and i do n't see that changing and even if it did ...... how long would it last ?
i felt this way during my last marriage just before we divorced and i 'm starting to feel it now .
i think that at some point there is just too much that has come between you and some things you just ca n't get back .
i wish that were n't <UNK> but it is .
he could n't or would n't even look me in the face much less in the eye .
i have no clue what i have done but it must have been pretty bad .
"so "" c "" comes home at a decent hour yesterday , say <UNK> , ( shock ! ! ! )"
"nope , he still has n't spoke a single word to me and actually i 'm quite tired of this stupid little game that he 's playing ."
while still young ...... i'm too damn old for this shit !
"( remember he is keeper of the money now as he has cut me off from the bank account , or have i not mentioned that part yet ? )"
"<UNK> or not <UNK> he has to go to work this morning , he does n't work weekends ."
"i 'm not wasting my time calling to see if he is there , screw that !"
"to make matters <UNK> i really hate talking badly about my sister , but i kind of have to in order for you to get the whole picture ."
"so i have always been <UNK> of her intentions , and i do tend to keep my guard up when it comes to her because of our past ."
"my motto has always been "" if you can take my man ..... you can have him "" ."
"( because if he 's <UNK> , then i do n't want him anyway ."
i would tell her immediately if her hubby came on to me or i even thought that he had .
"i asked her if there was any way that she could have <UNK> his behavior and she said "" absolutely not "" ."
i hate it for her that i am better looking than her and was always the first choice with the guys ... a little ego there huh ? )
"or is she trying to make me believe that "" she won "" this time because my guy came on to her ?"
"so now i am pissed , actually beyond pissed and could care less if "" c "" ever talks to me again ."
"i woke up "" this morning "" and totally freaked out because my clock said <#> pm ! ! !"
i know i have been stressing and not <UNK> enough sleep
thank god what had happened is that the power had went out at some point in the night and it was only <#> am .
i 'm really letting all of this get to me too much .
i tell myself that it 's normal to be feeling these mixed emotions but i still do n't like this shit !
"now i am just <UNK> about nothing really , i need to get off of here for now ."
i look forward to any responses or even <UNK> about the head and shoulders from y'all .
am i over <UNK> or do i have good reason to be feeling what i am feeling .
am i allowing this to get out of hand or
"do i really have no control , which is how i feel ."
actually i feel trapped because of my non - working idiot self and not having the immediate ability to get the hell out of dodge .
i need to finish my degree if i want to provide comfortably for my children and myself and not struggle from paycheck to paycheck .
and why the hell should i lose my home when he is the <#> who is doing this shit ?
"what i really want to do is just take off completely , go <UNK> , anywhere just to get away for awhile ."
next weekend she is supposed to go to her dad 's for the weekend
so i am thinking seriously about just packing a bag and making a road trip ......
oh well <UNK> it 's a beautiful day and there are things to do and people to see ..... not really
i 'm off to find something to do with this day . by the way ....
i'm still ..... horny and lonely and oh yeah !
i 'm still married too and it still sucks ! !
:o ) i just want all of this to come to an end ... some way .... somehow !
i 'm not at all suicidal so do n't let that cross your mind
", i have too much to live for ."
"not sure what happened to that post , maybe it will show up twice ! !"
"anyway ...... it 's late and i am , as usual , awake ."
am i the only <#> up at this hour ? ?
"i found this while surfing , ca n't remember where though ."
you have to answer a couple of simple <UNK> questions but you do n't have to join anything and it 's pretty awesome .
again i appreciate the comments and will post some more tomorrow on the situation and odd ramblings from my recently <UNK> and confused mind . especially to : anonymous
"who has been most helpful , i 'd really like to know how to contact you for general conversation or is that not allowed in the blog world ?"
":o ) i checked out the site you directed me to yesterday and i am learning alot from there , i appreciate the advice ! !"
well another day and things look no better .
i really appreciate those of you who left comments .
it 's really nice to have someone who understands and wants to <UNK> my hubby besides me .
i am definitely going to check out the website that was suggested .
as for right out asking him if he 's cheating ....
"i know that wo n't work because i have no doubt that if asked he will say "" no "" whether he is cheating or not ."
i 'd like to think that he is not cheating but all the signs say that he is .
most of my <UNK> are based on me being <UNK> .
that 's the moment i decided that he was definitely cheating .
i did n't start this blog as a means to whine and i do n't want it to turn into that .
but he is very close to my kids and i do n't want to shake up their world either with a divorce .
"he has kids of his own from a prior marriage , <#> , <#> and <#> and we all get along wonderfully ."
"when we started dating , i was a full - time student working towards my as in nursing ."
"i 'm not a sit back and <UNK> kinda girl , i 'm an"
""" okay , if this is how you want it then let 's <UNK> "" kinda girl ."
i 'm still young ( <#> ) and attractive and have many years ahead of me to continue down this path we call life .
"i wo n't sit around and be put upon , if he 's moving on then so am i."
so anyway ....... thanks for listening :o ) and thanks again for the input .
i agree with the passive <UNK> mentality of what he 's doing and it sucks ! grow up already !
i 'm off to check out that website . on a lighter note
my daughter is a varsity <UNK> for her high <UNK> ( as well as a senior this year ) and next friday is our first <UNK> game .
ta for now and live life to it 's fullest ! ! !
well ......... i've been reading some blogs here lately and tonight i thought ....
i guess the best way to start is with how i am feeling today !
to sum it up in <#> swift <UNK> and lonely .
which probably would n't be so bad but i am married .
short background info : divorced in <#> ....... <UNK> in <#> to the man of my dreams
( and this is where i got my blog name from ) i think he is cheating on me .
"not that this is a good enough excuse for "" c "" ( even though i think it is , but who the hell am i ? ? )"
"while he is gone , we <UNK> our marriage , the best we can from over <#> miles away and <#> months over the telephone and e - mails ."
he 's been back <#> months now and our marriage is heading down the same path that it was before he left ............ not good .
do n't get me wrong ........ when our relationship is good ....
"i 'm sure "" c "" feels the same way ."
i have to say here that i do love him very dearly and i know part of me always will .
"i , having the <UNK> imagination that i do ...."
"<UNK> a <UNK> , always a <UNK> "" , "" you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks "" ."
( i think i 've heard that somewhere before .....
i think i do have reasons to feel paranoid .
he later changed his mind and had the divorce dropped .
"part of me says "" grow up , your acting like a <#> year old asshole "" and the other part of me screams ..."
"just when things are on the <UNK> for me in the life department , my marriage is heading down south ."
i love this man with all my heart and i ca n't imagine being without him .
so what 's a girl to do ? ?
"i guess i 've <UNK> enough for a first post .............. any insight , any ideas ? ?"
"by the way .... go usa , can you believe how the individual all - around <UNK> finals turned out ?"
"welcome to the dance , welcome to the <UNK> , passion and warfare , to life immortal ..."
"passion , love , sex , beauty , style , <UNK> , emotion , what s what s important , the dance <UNK> ,"
i am <UNK> the resident <UNK> artist for hee bee <UNK> bees ( happy dance ) my art is in a gallery what a trip man ....
i 'm not sure why tonight except that i 'm staying with my grandmother while i 'm visiting my family .
when i do that i generally go to some local video <UNK> at night a couple of times a week .
in each booth is a tv showing porn on <#> to <#> channels depending on the place .
"you get in , lock the door , put in some money and whack off ."
it 's taking me many years to get up to this point .
i 'm in my mid <UNK> and this was my first time and only my 3rd time to a strip club .
i know quite a few people that have gone quite a few more times and i 'm not talking about <UNK> or ca n't get a girl people either .
i turned down the first couple of girls .
she sat down on my lap and asked me several times .
i declined a couple of times but she wore me down and
"i know that every club is different and each city , county , country has different laws and this being my first"
i was n't sure what i could and could n't do or where it would lead .
this place had semi private <UNK> around the room which was nice so did n't think about people looking on .
i told the girl i was a lap dance virgin .
"she did n't say anything so i 'm not sure if she did n't hear or thought "" they always say that "" or what ."
anyway she started by climbing on my lap her back to mine and reached behind her and <UNK> me thought my pants .
then she got off and pushed her ass in my <UNK> and ground it in .
she then took my hands on put them on her bare stomach giving me the okay to touch her .
"for those that have seen the movie "" go "" you can see this place was different ."
i closed my eyes and just wished it was my lover instead of this lap dance girl .
she turned around on pushed her breasts up into my face with a bikini on .
both to have soft breasts brushing my face and also to be that physically close to a woman .
i put my arms around her and firmly <UNK> her back and butt and legs .
at <#> point she put my hand on her bikini covered <UNK> and had me rub .
sure if it was my girlfriend but really i just liked touching her <UNK> .
she had very nice smooth skin except for <#> large <UNK> on the back of her thigh .
what if it was a <UNK> sore for example .
interestingly i did n't get hard or not that hard .
i suppose it was being nervous though i did n't feel that nervous .
supposedly i got a <#> for <#> deal .
it was $ <#> and went by pretty quick so i ca n't <UNK> how short a normal deal is .
she asked if i wanted another <#> for <#> deal and i said no .
i think you could pay more for her to get naked but after it was over i thought about that
"second , if her <UNK> was naked i would be thinking about disease ."
i know that in japan there are places you can make out with the women and lick their bodies .
i can say that i would totally enjoy some kind of similar action from my girlfriend .
that made me wonder if there is any similar behavior that most women would enjoy .
also <UNK> an ass in a woman 's <UNK> just does n't seem like it would have the same physical effect .
him and his wife are living in a very cool old house in the historic district of his city .
the house has been <UNK> both inside and out and is just beautiful .
my best friend also recently bought a house and just moved into it .
and he 's gotten a place like <#> houses from the beach .
"him and his beautiful , smart , cool , loving wife are in the process of having it adjusted to their liking ."
in a way i 'm not sure i want to see it because i know i 'll be extremely jealous .
can i get myself to take the steps required ?
is it that simple as decided to do it or does it require more luck than sweat ?
i guess i believe in the sweat side of that .
i 'm looking for a lover ! ! !
someone to be in love with and that is in love with me .
i want to stare into each other 's eyes .
i want to wrap my arms around you and have you wrap your arms around me .
"to go on dates , to buy small presents for each other , to spend special holidays together ."
"to share music , movies , <UNK> and travel ."
i 'm also looking for a best friend .
"someone to talk to , to exchange ideas , advice , opinions , feelings with ."
"to do projects together whether is buying <UNK> , <UNK> a room or garden or making <UNK> or a website ."
"finding each other attractive , a turn on , exciting and fun ."
it 's christmas eve and i 'm fucking lonely .
i fucking hate being lonely and i feel like i 've been lonely most of my life .
maybe it 's <#> of those things where i 'm just focusing on the wrong stuff .
"i 'll see <#> aunts , <#> uncles , <#> cousins , <#> <UNK> , my mom and a few other people on christmas ."
it 's been <#> years since my last girlfriend and she was pretty much perfect .
"anyway , you 'll just have to except that it makes sense for now but that does n't mean i do n't still long for her ."
* if you 're wondering she 's now married with <UNK>
i know there is a tendency to <UNK> over any problems but to be perfectly honest there were none except for the whole timing thing .
"had we not split up i have no <UNK> that we would still be together but still , she did seem like a perfect match ."
"she <UNK> who i am , liked me , had the similar interests i 'd always been looking for ."
"she was attractive to me , not a <UNK> , creative and also my best friend at the time ."
"i 'm not stupid , i know she 's moved on with her life ."
i know there are other fish in the ocean .
there are quite a few women in my life but none more than casual friends as in i see them once a month or less .
and of course i 'm constantly <UNK> if <#> of them is a * <UNK> are they best friend potential .
it seems like most people just go for looks and then after starting a relationship they get to know each other and become friends .
"if they are compatible they become friends , if not they break up and move on to the next"
* <UNK> i do n't know if that 's the most common way but it is n't rare .
"but , my point is it 's not so easy for me to start a relationship quick and jump in the sack ."
if i knew the woman did n't care .
"so , i wait and like previous girlfriends , hope that at some point it will be clear to me that i 'm truely interested and so is she ."
"anyway , that seemed a bit off topic when what i really want to write about is how much i want to be in love with someone ."
"of course i want sex , i want <UNK> , i want hugs , i want permission to touch somebody often ."
walk around and come up from behind and wrap my arms around them .
also kind of scary is i can hear myself trying to <UNK> a relationship with women that i know i 'm not a match for .
just because i so long for the physical part if i can have nothing else .
"simple things , riding around in a car and sliding my finger down her arm as she 's looking out the window . even just sharing the same space ."
there are about <#> women in my life .
<UNK> i 'm not physically attracted to at all .
she looks like an <UNK> to me . sorry if you or your friends are part <UNK> but i have yet to see of picture of an attractive <UNK> .
she 's a nice person but there is no special other attraction to overcome the lack of any physical attraction .
another woman is a <UNK> and very very strong believer in <UNK> .
another women is <#> years younger than me and is still living at home .
i do n't want to be her dad .
"she seems interested but her signals are not strong so i 'm not sure and ,"
as she lives at home that seems pretty much impossible .
i would n't be able to sleep at her place and she ca n't stay out all night as her parents are watching .
i suppose that 's over thinking it but it does seem like an impossible situation .
another women i 've known for about <#> years now .
she 's <#> of the nicest people i know but we have nothing at all in common .
i was watching some drama and there was a woman who seems very much like her .
so nice that she ends up being the <UNK> of a family that is having some troubles .
"people have pointed out how that 's supposedly the * perfect * type of woman , especially in many asian cultures and so i 've thought about her ."
but we really have almost <#> in common ?
another women i know is a friend of the previous women .
she 's probably got the best body of all the women .
i have no idea if she knows how to use it but she does know how to show it off .
she 's creative and likes to do <UNK> but again there is very little in common .
there are <#> or <#> others that i know much less well and that i would not really <UNK> friends yet
"well , for the last few years i 've been into japanese anime or manga porn ."
if you 've seen <UNK> you have some idea have how strange it can get .
there is tons of sex related manga and anime from japan .
some people ( with small minds <UNK> ) do n't get it .
how can a drawing of people having sex do anything for someone .
sexual fantasy is a pretty open ended issue .
for me sexual fantasy is <#> % about pleasure and many of the fantasy images in the strange porn manga look very <UNK> .
women doing it with <UNK> like creatures so they have <#> arms touching more than <#> <UNK> could .
any <UNK> where <#> person appears not to be enjoying it turns me off which would pretty much cover most of the <UNK> series .
another women i started something with did n't mind that i read it but did n't personally have any interest in looking at it .
"so , although i 'm pretty sure i 'll eventually find another match sometimes the odds seem overwhelming ."
there 's this woman who i have spent no time alone with .
i did spend <#> days with her and another woman showing them around la and vegas .
"she 's super busy , <#> jobs so she has no time to meet ."
"but anyway , the thing is , i find myself up all night thinking about her ."
"wanting to <UNK> my thoughts to her , to talk to her , to hold her etc ."
"i know this is normal , you can read about in just about every love story or hear about it in every other love song ."
"( ca n't eat , ca n't sleep etc ) but , i 'm <#> and i 'm mostly over that kind of stuff ."
"<#> , happiness that i 'm having these feelings as it 's been a while since i 've been so interested in someone ."
"another is though is that it 's stupid , i ca n't <UNK> my feelings by <UNK> ( i 'd like to believe i could"
also i really do n't know this woman .
our only time together so far as been that week with the <#> of us
so i 've spent no time alone with her .
i just went on <UNK> and noticed an article about anime ( urllink <UNK> ) so i posted this response :
well i have to say i 'm a little disappointed .
"although the author saw some anime , venus <#> is pretty old ."
nor does the majority of japanese anime released in the u.s .
represent the norm in adult oriented anime in japan .
<UNK> beast anime porn is actually pretty hard to find here .
you <UNK> get more just general sex except it 's animated .
"also , the author clearly comes from a bias that anime porn is <UNK> , pick your negative image ."
although i 'd guess <#> might get that from the releases in the states i find it no different in essence than reading <UNK> forum .
clearly those stories are made up or at least some of them are .
porn manga and porn anime are just <UNK> stories .
going back to your <UNK> <UNK> images clearly suggests the anime did n't do it for you .
what i get out of fantasy sexual materials is the fantasy that <#> can have extraordinary pleasure .
the rape scenes do bother me but again those are not the norm .
"but , what i generally get out of porn anime and porn manga is the dream of super pleasure ."
"in <#> manga , a girl and her girl friend enters a <UNK> machine ."
in the machine the main girl has a penis .
the friend has a ring about <#> inches across .
"she slips it over her friend 's penis , <UNK> a button and the ring <UNK> in half becoming <#> rings and essentially becomes a <UNK> ."
the girl 's penis goes in ring # <#> and comes out ring # <#> .
"this allows the friend to suck the penis , then the main girl to suck her own penis ."
then to use her own penis to fuck herself therefore feeling both the pleasure of a penis during sex and the <UNK> of a <UNK> during sex .
it 's coming out of ring # <#> deep inside her <UNK> with the tip eventually appearing at her entrance .
sounds pretty <UNK> to me if it was possible .
another similar idea you can find is what are called dick girls .
sometimes the <UNK> are <UNK> so while <#> dick girl # <#> has her cock in the cunt of dick girl # <#> .
"dick girl # <#> has her long dick up her stomach , between her <UNK> breast and is giving herself head ."
"if you 're curious about some of this stuff , <#> of the monthly magazines that sometimes carries it is called angel ."
<UNK> i want sex ! ! ! ! !
why do you have to have so many morals and worries ! ! !
i have n't seen vanilla sky but in the trailer at appears that tom cruise 's character has casual sex with cameron <UNK> 's character .
"i 've probably met at least <#> women in the last year which , if i had asked or made a few moves i could have slept with ."
"but , it seems like , in almost all cases , i would have been lying to them with my body ."
<#> or the other of us will hope that it means more .
"that through the act of sex a connection will be made , <#> will start liking the other etc ."
"in fact the message seem to be , meet , have sex , decide later if you want to meet again ."
"in completely other news , i <UNK> a <UNK> lot of <UNK> ."
"but , in the last few years , i 've gotten into <UNK> comics ."
"now i know , some of you will think "" that 's stupid , who could get off on pictures "" ."
"well , to that , i can point out that plenty of people get off on stories as in <UNK> forum , <UNK> , those sex story books ."
even <#> of my x - girlfriends wanted to point out to me how <UNK> her romance novels got .
"but , more so than at least the published sex books , published comics have new and interesting ideas ."
there 's also the videos i mentioned before with multi - <UNK> demons doing <#> girls at once with <#> or more <UNK> in every hole and others <UNK> .
"<#> genre that really does it for me is though , recently is what 's called dick girls ."
i 'm sure it sounds kind of scary but a dick girl is just that .
"not instead of a cunt but usually , instead of a <UNK> ."
"in other words , where her <UNK> would be is a <#> inch dick ."
"sometimes it 's just there , other times it 's an <UNK> thing ."
she looks normal until she <UNK> it a little and it grows out .
"of course , having all the parts looks extremely <UNK> ."
of course like all comics it 's a fantasy .
just like all anime girls have huge eyes and look cute
"dick girls on the other hand , being total fantasy , i find it quite <UNK> ."
is our ( men 's ) programming that strong !
when i see a thin <UNK> woman my heart just <UNK> .
i 'm sitting here on a singapore <UNK> flight and the <UNK> ' dresses <UNK> their figures so perfectly .
"it just makes me want to reach out , slide my hand along the inside of that <UNK> curve at about the <UNK> height and pull them to me ."
"in other news i wrote something on jan 7th , about a full screen 's worth that i completely lost ."
it sure seems like i 'd be happier with a <UNK> .
then i would n't over think things etc .
i wonder if life is really about having enough <UNK> in your life so that you do n't have to think about it .
r. the <#> day following my last entry were bliss .
it seemed to me she was interested in me too .
s was around but every moment of the day i wanted to reach out and hold her and kiss her .
she seemed to be paying more attention to me and also seemed to be using a <UNK> voice as though she was trying to attract me .
"still , i 've resolved myself to at least go for it ."
s might be interested in which case she will be disappointed if i go for ms .
"r. but , i 'm not interested in ms ."
r so as i keep telling myself there 's nothing to do but try .
"if i do n't try , eventually i will unlikely be best friends sometime in the future ."
if i try and fail i get the same result .
the only way to get any results is to try .
"so , i sent off a quick e - mail in japanese saying i something like "" help !"
i still have no job so i 'm free even on <UNK> .
"if you have time , lets us <#> go out for dinner sometime "" ."
i 'm not sure if that 's what i wrote since it 's in japanese and i 'm bound the make mistakes .
"the answer i got back is "" i turned the photos in and they should be back in <#> days ."
i 'm pretty busy with various stuff but i 'll try to get the photos to you as soon as possible .
""" should i read into that that she 's not interested ?"
thinking back this reminds me of my x - wife .
when i first started dating her i was nearly <#> % sure she was interested but after our first short <UNK> .
it was n't much more than a walk on the beach .
"anyway , i do n't remember what she said the next day but it was something that to me suggested she did n't want to see me ."
"on top of that the next song i heard was that song that starts "" <#> is the <UNK> number that there 's ever been "" ."
of course the stupid thing was that i jumped to conclusions because either the same day or the next night we hooked up again .
"so , as i say i over think everything ."
she 's <#> - <#> years younger than me .
i notice myself attracted to like every 8th woman i see .
it used to be that when i had a crush on <#> woman i tuned all others out .
if this woman is <UNK> will she still be in <#> years when i 'm <#> and she 's <#> ?
i 've almost always considered myself not to like that <UNK> in a woman .
i got out of it after we got married .
my think though i like to find <UNK> though of course if someone else was paying i would n't mind a few expensive brand clothes .
"then , i try to tell myself it does n't matter if she 's right long term ."
i should just go for it and if it 's short term at least it should be fun for a while .
if she 's not interested currently should i still pursue ?
"r , we just spent the last <#> days together"
"i found that the more time i spent with you the more i feel like i was falling in love with you . """
"is she ready to her that or should i play it slower , go a few times and * feel * it out ."
i thought about posting a message to some website or at least something talking about falling for her since it is likely that she will end up reading it .
i thought about writing her in e - mail but my current thinking is i '
d rather say something in person . which is why i sent that short message above and was disappointed by the reply .
"i picture myself going to dinner , and maybe after dinner * popping * the question to the effect of "" lets be more than friends "" ."
then of course come all the other complications and over thoughts .
"if it did happen , when would i get to meet her ?"
"she lives with her parents , <#> minutes from me ."
if i get a job in japan i 'll only have possibly friday nights and the weekends .
my fantasy dream is that we 'd fall madly in love and nearly immediately move to <UNK> .
why do i get so far ahead in my thinking ?
she told me she 's decided she 's going to get <UNK> next year .
"then , she also said she wants to be the <#> to propose ."
""" of course you can guess where my mind went with that ."
i 'm also struggling with the whole japan thing .
"if she is not interested , will that make me lose all interest in being in japan ?"
before we spent the week together there was another woman at that office that i thought i should pursue .
r does n't work out should i go for ms .
will i be perceived as a <UNK> for trying for ms .
m. they are friends or at least <UNK> .
m mean i 'm not really interested in ms .
i was even <UNK> attracted to the <UNK> at a restaurant i went to yesterday .
"so , from all that i start thinking about what makes ms ."
she seems mostly easy going and not <UNK> at all .
she seems like she would be generally loving and caring and would enjoy someone that really loves and cares for her .
"airport infront of the daily grill , waiting for my plane back to tokyo ."
i found that last night i was more excited than i can ever remember about going back and the chance to see her .
"then this morning i got the short reply and then was feeling somewhat opposite as in , well , if ms ."
r is not interested maybe that should decide it .
i have <#> short weeks to find a job .
i might be able to make that march 1st but i 'm really cutting it close with my money .
"at that point , all moving etc will have to go on my credit cards which ."
i think i have <UNK> in japan and <UNK> in america at this point .
r is that she seems more adventurous than me .
", hopefully that would help me to do those things ."
i 'm sleeping in the arms of my girlfriend and i was dreaming about my girlfriend from <#> years ago .
she called and said she had already left .
"i asked her if she was angry and she said no , i was going to ask her if i could come over but then i woke up ."
there is something about me that just wants to fuck and suck my brains out .
i guess supposedly that 's not <UNK> for a guy but lately it 's been on my mind more than usual .
"but , as i was walking home i was thinking how <UNK> seems so <UNK> to get naked ."
"she was naked on her cd cover , naked in 5th element and a few other movies i guess and often naked or next to it in this movie ."
"from <#> to <#> ( <#> years ) , there has only been sex in my life <#> years ."
why can i not just go out and get fucked .
it 's about having someone to share your life with .
"go out with , talk to , eat with , shower with , sleep with , travel with ."
many of my friends consider themselves in the shy side of the <UNK> .
"and yet , d has been with e for like <UNK> years now ."
"j has been with d since he was <#> , that 's <UNK> years ."
g has been with s for at least <#> .
"e had j for <#> years , <#> year off , then s for <#> years now or is it <#> ."
"then , i do n't envy d or j. g and s seem like a great match but i do n't envy them ."
"s. k seems pretty awesome , she 's smart and can use a computer ."
j has y who seems like a perfect match for him and very cool .
"very nice , very loving , very smart , very talented and has very common interests ."
today i met d and f and f is super awesome .
"she has all the systems , a huge collection , plays all the pc games and is cute as hell ."
i 've got to get moving ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i 've got to do something ! ! ! !
because there are things i want to talk about that i 'm not comfortable talking about non - <UNK> .
"i 'll be honest , i 'm not sure if this stuff should be discussed publicly or not ."
maybe this is what most people tell a <UNK> or something .
"ok ... i've been watching the olympics every night for about a year ( or so it seems ) , and i 'm bored already ."
"went bowling tonight ( friday night is boys 's night out ) , and did n't even miss the hype . by the way"
"pretty damned impressive , even if i say so myself ."
"fortunately , he 's a pretty cool guy , so he still likes hanging out with me regardless ."
"if the situation was <UNK> , i ca n't say that i would be in an <UNK> mood tonight ."
"so , anyways , back to the olympics ."
"is it just me , or was the <UNK> competition all about who sucked the least ?"
"it seems that with every olympics , the quality <UNK> and the lesser of the losers wins ."
maybe i was spoiled with mary lou <UNK> and that <UNK> chick from ages ago .
i 'd like to see a deserved <#> every now and then .
what does it say if these are the best <UNK> in the world and they screw their <UNK> up ?
"for god <UNK> man , you 've got <#> different events to practice for ."
you practice every god - damned day for <#> friggin ' years .
you 'd think that you had it down pat by now .
"but then again , that 's not my career ."
"big <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and that twin guy , whatever his name is ."
performing under that kind of pressure must suck big time .
"but then again , they both screwed up that horse thing ... which should have never ever happened ."
what 's with the make - up on all the us female <UNK> ?
"- i wo n't even try to spell her name ) , they had very little make - up on ."
do n't try to look like a <#> year old who needs make - up .
you are going to spend the rest of your life trying to regain that <UNK> glow you have now .
"enjoy it while you can , and do n't cover it up with base and blue eye shadow ."
"swimming seems to be going pretty well for us , and"
michael <UNK> is kicking some major ass in the pool .
that 's always fun to watch an event and being pretty sure that your country will win .
it must suck big - time to be living in <UNK> and watching your <UNK> coming in 8th place every damned event .
"imagine the excitement that <#> time when they come in 7th place - "" woo hoo !"
"we did n't come in last place ! "" ."
it 's times like these that make me happy to be in the u.s .
"of course , during the winter olympics it 's probably much better to be a canadian ."
though that weird canadian accent would drive me nuts after a while .
"speaking of which , the word is "" sorry "" , not "" sore - <UNK> "" ."
"besides , we know that all the long - distance races will be won by the <UNK> anyways ."
i guess having <UNK> and tigers chasing your asses day - in and day - out tend to make you learn to run fast .
i used to run track in high school .
i was really good at the long - distance races .
only problem was that the coach decided that he did n't have enough <UNK> <UNK> .
"but that did n't matter to him , because he was just trying to get a complete line - up for each event ."
that 's the kind of philosophy that fucks with our competitive effort .
maybe i could have given those <UNK> dudes some competition .
i quit the team after about <#> weeks .
"then i discovered the joy of cigarettes and booze , and there was no turning back ."
"so , anyways , i think i 'm about done with this olympics ."
"i 'd watch the basketball , but it comes on about <#> am <UNK> here , and try as i might , i ca n't do that ."
"i 'd <UNK> it , but you never would know what you are <UNK> ."
"with my luck , i 'd end up with <#> hours of a soccer match between afghanistan and <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , each player rules in the nba ."
"but , put them all together , and none of them knows how to play as a team ."
it 's the same problem that the lakers had last season .
a bunch of selfish <UNK> who could n't play well together .
i 'm going to hit the sack and dream about what i will write about tomorrow .
for anyone brave or bored enough to read this entire <UNK> - i thank you .
for the ones who quit half - way through - i understand your pain .
"your not - so - beloved leader , <UNK>"

"i found this to be a very moving end - movie to the trilogy , some fantastic battle scenes in it , which i found to be very emotional ."

"without being a bore , it does skip a lot of events from the book , most <UNK> being the <UNK> of <UNK> from the scenes in <UNK> ."
i gather that they will be in place with the special edition of the film .

it hit me bad in ' <#> and i ended up in hospital with <UNK> depression for a few months .
these days i find it <UNK> and it only hits me occasionally from time to time .
this blog will just detail my thoughts of the day .
"when i was <#> years old , i went on a train trip ."
i know i was <#> because my mom had just had my little sister and she is just over <#> years younger than i am .
"my older sister also accompanied us , she would have been <#> ."
i don’t remember a lot about the trip except that i had a lot of fun playing on the seats .
they faced each other and i could lean and bounce onto <#> and then turn around and bounce on the other .
i giggled a lot and my youngest sister cried sometimes .
it wasn’t until i was <#> years old that mention of the trip ever even came up again .
my mom asked me if i had ever been on a train .
i said just the once with her when i was really little .
i gave her all the details i could remember and she thought i had dreamed it all up because she had never taken us on a train .
a few days later i asked my dad if mom had ever taken us <#> girls on a train anywhere .
“ right after your sister was born your grandmother had a heart attack .
"my parents have always been a little <UNK> at the things i remember from my childhood , but have never made a big issue of it ."
", i remember a lot of things about my early childhood ."
"before my mom even had my little sister , i was <UNK> with a severe <UNK> infection ."
i remember going into the emergency room and <#> to <#> people holding me down to <UNK> me .
i remember they later put a net over my crib because i kept climbing out .
i remember them coming in every morning to take my temperature .
i remember there were quite a few other <UNK> in the hospital room and that mine was the second <#> on the left when you came in the door .
i remember my mom getting furious over the fact that they had put a <UNK> on me after she had already <UNK> trained me .
she was expecting another <#> soon and she didn’t want <#> in <UNK> at the same time ! there is a psychological test that is used sometimes .
” it is always fascinating to see people go through their minds and search for details .
it is also fascinating to see how much of an impact that memory has had on their entire life .
the need for speed is a huge factor in his life .
my earliest memory is of waking up in my body after i was born .
"no , way ” , but i really do remember ."
"i woke up and i was laying on my right side , wrapped up <UNK> ; my crib was on the back right side of a room ."
i could see a red brick wall outside the window .
the window had a black metal <UNK> over it .
"my first thoughts were , “ wow , it is so cold and tight here ” ."
i was so tiny compared to the crib and compared to how i was previously .
"it is this memory , this <UNK> , that allows me to know for sure , that a human soul does not enter a body until it is born ."
we all have this memory ; we have just chosen to forget it .
i have a cousin that <UNK> a <#> year old girl when he was <#> .
when he was about <#> he got a <#> year old girl pregnant .
she quickly learned the true nature of her new husband and <UNK> pretty fast after the baby was born .
"i don’t know if she was pregnant when she left or if that came later , but it wasn’t long before she found herself expecting again ."
she <UNK> to death at the age of <#> .
her son was awarded a <#> dollar <UNK> that he received when he was <#> .
they were able to put a dollar figure on her life .
these <#> pieces of information have been <UNK> together in my mind and in my very being .
in a perfect world every child would be a wanted child .
there is a bottom line when it comes to the quality of life .
i 'm currently reading a book called weapons of choice by john <UNK> .
a <UNK> of coalition ships are preparing for war in the pacific in <#> .
they are accompanied by a scientific <UNK> performing <UNK> surrounding the <UNK> of different items .
an experiment goes horribly wrong and the <UNK> finds itself in the middle of a war in the pacific in <#> .
the really interesting parts have to do with how the service personnel deal with each other .
the <#> <UNK> are shocked to see women and <UNK> serving in the future navy and <UNK> and most are <UNK> .
"the <#> <UNK> face a lot of <UNK> and racism , which , at first , really surprised me ."
the <UNK> ( and <UNK> ) are always looked back upon as the innocent times ...
when homes like <UNK> <UNK> 's were the norm .
"however , the longer i thought about it , i realized that <UNK> <UNK> probably would have happened ."
"my parents , who were children in the <UNK> , faced a lot of discrimination ."
"i 'm not saying that we 're perfect yet ... <UNK> a long way from that , but we have improved ."
it 's no longer unusual to see <UNK> couples or <UNK> in positions of power .
"what a shock it would be for people from <#> to come this far into the future , let alone meeting people from <#> !"
i ca nt imagine i m terribly unique that way ...
had i paid attention from the beginning maybe i would feel less * <UNK> since my bothers suicide in <#> my mind seems to have left me ... at 1st
i could nt read a book .... or a <UNK> for that matter .... or think things through w/o feeling overwhelmed
i think maybe i should try some <UNK> chinese medicine to help my memory ...
cuz that'll do the trick .... its bizarre that a person can leave such a hole in a person ...
being touched by another human that way makes me feel very vulnerable of course .....
my sister .... my last <UNK> ..... the only <#> who can make me an <UNK> ... ? ?
death - while perfectly natural - is a <UNK> ...
i have nt talked about my brother in a while .... <UNK> been keeping him in my head ...
perhaps why i have this free flowing wave right now to talk about him .
the boy who used to torment me when we had to share a room .... the boy i would beat on ...
the boy i was taken from during yet another divorce ....
we maintained a very close relationship despite distance and time ...
of course often you do nt know just how much a person means to you until they re gone .... and wo nt ever be back again .
"its a sick sick thing to know anyone you love <UNK> , physically or inside their own head of loneliness , <UNK> , dread and sadness ... fuck ..."
i wonder how many things i spelled wrong ?
so i will take my chances .... despite the lack of <UNK> and being over <UNK> i am <UNK> ....
so plz ignore the <UNK> .... not that i expect
any <UNK> ...... i do nt really know how blogs work .
i must go to work like the little <UNK> <UNK> i am .... more to come ...

hey these are just the thoughts of <#> man .
find your own rules and live by them .
if you come across <#> that would be beneficial to other men please share them .
we are in this together and it is our duty to do anything to help another man get laid –
what you forgot rules # <#> and # <#> already ?
take the hard right over the easy wrong .
this is the final <UNK> of the code .
"i put it near the bottom not because it isn’t important , but because i want you to remember it ."
everything you do and say tells others who you really are .
we may still be your friends but we will always think less of you .
i know many of you are saying this is <UNK> stuff and moreover you have surely offended some .
how can we give out our best secrets to women or risk the wrath of half the planet ’s <UNK> ?
go back over the code as see if there is anything in it that every woman doesn’t already know about us .
men will never understand the women ’s code .
they should remain a <UNK> mystery otherwise life would be boring as hell !

next time you want to buy something and have no money or something bad happens to you just say <UNK> <UNK> and do n't let it stress you out .
i 'm sitting here laughing because i could say <UNK> <UNK> a <#> times and i would still stress out .
i have to admit i do n't hang on to the stress as long as i use too .
some <#> hit my car in a parking lot the other day and totally smashed my drivers side door .
this time i let it go in <#> days .
"my weight , my job , my marriage , <UNK> money as in the lack of ) , and all sorts of everyday things ."
i even stress out wondering if my dog is happy lol .
i love blogging because it let 's you type out all your thoughts and frustrations .
you get to really vent and sometimes you will find you are not alone because some <#> will comment on how they feel the same way .
i doubt there is anything that you can go through that some <#> else some where in the world has n't gone through the same thing .
they can take everyday stuff that happens to just about everyone and make us laugh at the situation or ourselves .
( i 'm going to spell check my blog but if you could see how i <UNK> this word the first time you would be laughing .
my husband is a bit more laid back than i am .
i do n't think he worries as much because i worry enough for the both of us .
i 'm sure sometimes i stress him out with worrying though .
i try to be more like him in some ways .
i try to be a little more laid back .
i think he is n't quite as laid back sometimes as he <UNK> though .
i think he does it just to help me .
he 's a good man and i 'm the <UNK> woman in the world to be married to him .
not every woman would think being married to him is the greatest thing in the world .
he has his faults and i have mine but we some how make them work together .
when we first got married we fought a lot .
sometimes i want to hit him over the head with a baseball bat .
i 'm sure there are many times he wishes he could do the same to me .
i 'm just lucky he puts up with me and loves me as much as he does .
we 've been married for <#> years now and to spend <#> night apart from each other drives us both crazy .
he 's my soul mate and i could not imagine life without him .
i promise not to make my blog all mushy about my hubby and how much i love him .
though i 'm sure you will see him mentioned many times .
"we were watching "" the <UNK> "" and i fell asleep in the middle of it ."
so this is the start of my blog .
urllink comedy central tv <UNK> the daily show with jon stewart
why is it that the only reliable source of news on television today is the daily show with john stewart ?
why is it that the fake news is more reliable and more informative than the real news ?
"american 's have learned more about their government in the last year from john stewart and michael moore than tom <UNK> , dan rather and peter <UNK> combined ."
there is more news on tv today than at any other time in our history .
there is more news media than in any other time in our history .
"and yet they continually get it wrong , continually fail to ask real <UNK> questions and always seem to be looking in the wrong direction ."
do journalists go to the same schools as the cia ?
what is there to be afraid of in reporting the truth ?
has media and corporate <UNK> gotten to the point where criticism of anyone in government or power will immediately feel the governments or some other unseen force 's wrath .
are large corporate interests so <UNK> with positions of government power that they are <UNK> ?
"thus , does <UNK> the bush administration and its treatment of the war in iraq affect nbc 's financial bottom line ?"
it 's gotten to the point where i only use the internet for getting my news .
it 's perspective is much more global than network news or any major american newspaper .
it picks up the columns of internet <UNK> and wire services .
it gives the little guy a voice in a market flooded with mega - media <UNK> .
"when was the last time network news really caught a politician in a lie first , and actually reported it , and when i say report it"
i mean the equivalent amount of <UNK> they spend on michael jackson stories .
urllink michael moore home page michael moore may have pulled a few cheap <UNK> in some of his previous movies .
"but i have yet to hear anyone , anywhere <UNK> any of the facts in fahrenheit <#> ."
it 's easier for the w <UNK> to just ignore it and hope moore will fade away .
"yes he is <#> sided , but not more than rush and <UNK> ."

"no , you ca n't claim that he 's created a few <#> <#> jobs after he 's lost millions ."
you have to replace those lost jobs before you can start adding .
<#> minus <#> and then adding <#> does n't mean you have created a new job .
i would also like to say a word or <#> about this idea that flipping burgers is a <UNK> job .
does that mean that high school kids should be paying union <UNK> to the service employees union ?
"come to think of it , teaching these kids about the history of unions might not be such a bad idea ."
i would agree that bush is on to something if he were serious enough about what <UNK> a <UNK> job to support their unions .
"as for his "" support "" of the constitution that he swore to "" preserve , protect and defend "" , mr ."
"if actions speak much louder than words , then his <UNK> clearly does n't pass the laugh test in light of what he has done since then ."
its lucky for him that his party does n't believe in the law anymore .
i used to look at her eyes on television and wonder why they had that same <UNK> look that other republican women have .

i been <UNK> here on my porch <UNK> at all the sale papers that came in the mail .

"cept now , they’re called “ office ” supplies !"
"don’t make no sense to me , neither ."

no such thing as <UNK> up an appointment to see your <UNK> teacher .

"either you want me there , or you don’t ."
"they need to learn that time is important to mama ’s and <UNK> , too ."
"some mama ’s got jobs , and those that don’t got meals to cook , homes to clean , and probably got clothes to fold !"

<UNK> <UNK> as dumb as most of <UNK> think .

"it does make a <UNK> good shelf to put some of my what - <UNK> on , though ."

"now that they <UNK> got a use fer a <UNK> , what do they think they’re gonna <UNK> their <UNK> man with <UNK> he needs it ?"

then some gal <UNK> thought we ought to get smart and start <UNK> us a new place .
i’m <UNK> to wonder <UNK> we were better off where we were .
i have spent the late afternoon watching the golden brown leaves of the <UNK> tree float slowly and <UNK> to the ground .
the pine straw is a bit heavy on the now <UNK> grass in my front yard .
i know i shouldn’t be wasting my time just sitting on the front porch .
i know i should be in the yard <UNK> up the leaves as they fall .
i just can’t bring myself to leave my <UNK> .
"i , after all , have a perfect autumn view ."
i can sit quietly listening to the birds getting ready to nest at evening light .
i can watch the <UNK> preparing themselves for the fast approaching winter .
i can see the pink <UNK> of an autumn evening sunset .
i can smell the soft <UNK> of a <UNK> beginning to burn .
i feel the cold breath of winter beginning to creep into the fast approaching night .
"my toes , poking out of the sandals that i have lived in since april , are suddenly quite <UNK> ."
"i know that soon , i will wake up to a yard that has been diamond <UNK> with the first <UNK> ."
all the leaves will have finally found their final resting place in my front yard .
the children will be catching the school bus in the early twilight of morning wearing new <UNK> and <UNK> .
"thanksgiving and christmas <UNK> will soon be showing up , glowing <UNK> in windows and dancing across <UNK> ."
the sound of <UNK> whining and <UNK> cracking will be <UNK> across the neighborhood <UNK> the golden glow of fires and the perfume of smoke to come .
i almost hate to think about removing the fallen leaves from the yard .
"the slow , <UNK> grace of the leaves falling down is as <UNK> as the soft , gray , <UNK> of smoke coming up from the <UNK> ."
the newly grounded leaves are the signal that winter is fast approaching .
they act as a reminder to get out your winter <UNK> and blankets .
"they tell you to <UNK> the lawn <UNK> , to break out the <UNK> and leaf bags , and get the yard ready for <UNK> weather ."
i don’t think i’ll worry about the leaves today .
"i may not worry about them tomorrow , either ."
i may just spend the early fall sitting on my front porch .
just sitting and watching as the season shows her finest colors and changes moods as quick as the fall wind blows .
"then again , i may not have to <UNK> them ."
maybe there will be a good strong wind to blow them all away into the <UNK> of my next door neighbors yard .
"<UNK> of a home where there now stands a lonesome <UNK> , there once was a home ."
"the <UNK> is all that remains as a <UNK> that once upon a time , someone cared ."
"with loving hands , each brick was carefully <UNK> in a <UNK> of mud ."
"even though all <UNK> of the home have long since disappeared , the <UNK> still proudly stands ."
how many cold mornings did this <UNK> serve it ’s purpose ?
how many children were <UNK> by it ’s <UNK> ?
"how many times has it <UNK> both soul and bottom , faces and hearts ?"
"how many times did the children of it ’s past warm their hands before going out into the cold , perhaps to school or to do their chores ?"
how many times has a father <UNK> his feet and hands after working in the fields ?
how many clothes did the mother press with the <UNK> that were heated here ?
the lonesome <UNK> now stands as a grave marker in time .
it makes a person wonder if it had a <UNK> .
maybe a bud <UNK> of <UNK> given by a child .
"think of the labor that went into the building of this <UNK> , and also of the building of the home and family that it <UNK> ."
"it now serves as a reminder that long ago , someone ’s father was young and strong enough to cut and split the wood for it ’s use ."
"that long ago , someone ’s mother was young and strong enough to keep that fire burning <UNK> ."
the outline of the home can still be seen if you look hard enough and possibly have a little imagination .
"if you listen long enough , you can almost hear the voices and laughter of the family that once lived here ."
you can see where there might have been a rope swing tied in the ancient oak that still stands in what must have been the front yard .
"if you are lucky enough to be here in <UNK> , you may see some of the mothers now wild <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through the soil ."
"you can imagine where the <UNK> was , where the garden , chicken <UNK> , and <UNK> pen must have been ."
"you can see what could have been the children ’s favorite place to play , and where the mother kept watch over them ."
the mother and father that once lived here grew old and watched as they slowly lost everything .
they were no longer young and strong enough for the old house .
life had called their children into a different way of life .
the children rarely visited after they grew up and moved away .
"sometimes , the old couple would receive a photograph or letter from the <UNK> , but not very often ."
the children decided that they were too old to remain in the house .
"sometimes , the roof would leak and the cold breath of winter would come creeping in the cracks around the doors ."
"after a lot of convincing , the couple was moved into a “ retirement ” home ."
the children never returned to the old home place .
"almost like a person , a home needs love to survive ."
"when no <#> cared anymore , slowly , board by board , and nail by nail , the old house lost it ’s strength and gave up ."
"no more laughter would fill it ’s rooms , no more dinners in it ’s kitchen , no more fires would burn ."
"maybe the <UNK> still stands in the hopes that someday , maybe a family will return ."
maybe they will see how well it has stood the test of time and <UNK> a new home around it .
"in the meantime , the lonesome <UNK> will continue to stand proudly , with the memories of the past ."
if only they could talk i have always been what you could call a yard sale <UNK> .
i can not count the saturday mornings spent with my family looking for that perfect bargain .
"i have <UNK> my home , bought gifts , <UNK> my entire family , met many interesting people , and saved plenty of money in the end ."
"an estate sale , though , is an altogether different story ."
"they are held on <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , or sometimes in living rooms when the weather is too cold or rainy ."
"they are held in every month , with spring and summer being the best ."
"they are held in big cities and small towns , and in <UNK> everywhere ."
"an estate sale , on the other hand , is often just as it says - the selling of a persons estate after death ."
"perhaps i have a melancholy view , but so be it ."
i have attended several estate sales with my mother .
i feel it is an invasion into a persons personal life .
just a way for the adult children to <UNK> of family “ junk ” so as to settle everything before they return to their busy lives .
i wonder if they would feel the same way if these items <UNK> over the years could talk ?
if they knew the rich memories behind all of the family junk .
if they knew what each piece had meant to the family member .
".... hello , i am grandfather clock ."
"i guess you could say i kept the time of this family , not just in minutes and hours , but in memories , too ."
it was me that father watched as each child was born into this family of mine .
"it was i who counted the time before the children went off to school , and before father went to work ."
it was i that let out the <UNK> to signal <UNK> and <UNK> .
"often , i was hated by the children because i <UNK> the end of some enjoyment , or the beginning of some dreaded <UNK> ."
"over the years , i’ve seen the children come and grow and move away ."
it was i that was stopped when father passed away .
"now that mother has passed away , our home is being separated and sold ."
i wish i could tell them all the things i remember .
my memories are for sale at the price of $ <#> .
i have hung in this hallway for over <#> years .
"he used to stand in front of me , with his hands wrapped around mother , and tell her how beautiful she was ."
i’ve watched as mother fixed her hair before going to church on sundays .
"i watched as son and daughter <UNK> and checked their looks before dates , prom nights , and weddings ."
"i saw the children grow from babies amazed at their reflections , to proud adults ."
"i’ve seen so much , but can tell them so little ."
"i’m not worn out or used up , but i guess i’m useless to son and daughter ."
if only they could <UNK> the memories i have .
i’m the <#> who watched sleeping babies in mothers arms .
"i remember all the nights of <UNK> , <UNK> , chicken <UNK> , and broken hearts ."
i remember all the sleepless nights mother spent with me while waiting for some member of the family to return safely home .
"i’m the <#> who stayed up with father when he sorted out problems ranging from a <UNK> with mother , to how to pay for daughters wedding ."
"i’ve seen more worry than most of the house , but i’ve seen plenty of joy , too !"
like the time mother discovered sons first tooth while nursing him right here !
and the time mother discovered what it felt like to rock a <UNK> for the first time .
so many memories wrapped up for the small price of $ <#> .
"i supposedly belonged to father , but spent most of my time with mother ."
"oh , sure , father used me from time to time ."
"to fix a few things like the nail in the front steps that keeps coming up , or putting up targets for sons first bb gun ."
"to open stuck windows , open paint can <UNK> , and pull out old nails ."
i was once used to threaten a sewing machine that wouldn’t <UNK> with mother while she was making a <UNK> for daughters wedding !
"i’ve had a few new <UNK> over the years , but i work just like new ."
"it seems with my experience , i would be worth more that the price tag of $ <#> ."
"my name is <UNK> , and i guess i’m the speaker for the kitchen crew ."
i assume we are the least thought of because we are the <UNK> priced .
nothing could make us feel better than to see their smiling faces after they had finished eating mothers homemade cookies or special saturday <UNK> .
the things she made for this family were pure <UNK> of love .
"mother always made things from scratch , never from a box ."
everything in this kitchen speaks of her love for this family .
"we wonder if our new families will have that same love , or will we be considered <UNK> and thrown away at the end of this sale ."
"with the breakdown of the family unit , it seems to me that some of us have forgotten just what the word family means ."
"will your children hold memories , or an estate sale price tag at the end of your life ?"
"will you remember the fishing trips with you father when you see his old tackle box , or will you see the price of a <UNK> ?"
"remember where you got each little <UNK> - <UNK> , each picture ."
"sure , some things may have no sentimental value , but what about the things that do ?"
think about these things the next time you see ... ....
"* estate sale * <#> any street your town , usa saturday <#> am to <#> pm"
it 's important to know that results are not not <UNK> with activity .
<#> can not increase returns by increasing investment activity .
<UNK> would venture to suggest that returns will actually <UNK> when activity increases .
this kind of thinking will bring with it many <UNK> <UNK> to ones investment operations .
it is important to know that there is a time to buy and a time to sit tight .
the sitting time should far and away <UNK> your active buying and selling .
this is good <UNK> <UNK> buy only at times when the odds are most in your favor .
the idea is to only make an advance when you are certain that you will not have to retreat .
<UNK> <UNK> is a master this kind of discipline .
perhaps no <#> is more <UNK> than the <UNK> of <UNK> .
<UNK> wanted to buy a big stake in coca cola back in the <#> 's .
<UNK> put coke on his watch list and simply waited for the stock price to come to him ... he was not going to chase the price .
the price would come down to a point that he found <UNK> he would never buy it .
<UNK> bought millions of shares that <UNK> to a very <UNK> portion of the entire company .
<UNK> was now <#> of coke 's largest <UNK> .
soon he found himself on coke 's board of directors .
"<UNK> 's investment vehicle , <UNK> <UNK> , has made an absolute killing on that big coke bet ... and they still hold those shares today ."
<UNK> has <UNK> to never sell those coke shares .
"the lesson here simply is to wait patiently until you are certain that once the advance is made , you will never have to retreat !"
"further , when the stars have lined up during that crucial <#> hour ... bet big !"
back up the truck as <UNK> did with his coca cola shares .
i like <UNK> 's analogy comparing <UNK> to baseball .
<UNK> says that buying <UNK> is like standing in the <UNK> 's box ready to take a swing .
<UNK> says that it is very important to be patient and wait for the fat pitch .
if we just patiently wait and <UNK> our <UNK> a very fat pitch is certain to come right down the middle .
these are the <UNK> that are sure to be crushed out of the ball park !
you never have to take a swing until you get that fat pitch .
most active <UNK> and <UNK> are constantly swinging at every pitch .
there are many <UNK> with this approach ... and many <UNK> investment losses often result .
so <#> of my major <UNK> is to be a <UNK> <UNK> .
"be certain that if i advance , i will not have to retreat ."
"finally , when the odds are heavily in my favor ... bet big !"
current funds available .... in <UNK> account : $ <#> other funds : $ <#> <UNK> 's total <UNK> : $ <#> more funds coming very soon ! ! !
"di , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> et <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> et in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"- <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , <#> - <#> i wonder how the japanese <UNK> the belief in <UNK> with <UNK> worship ."
"the shades , after all , have been <UNK> by the light of a new life , have n't they ?"
"a few days ago , i began to read a <#> book that sought to explain <UNK> to <UNK> ."
"interestingly enough , for me that is , the work very early <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"here is the passage : "" <#> members of the <UNK> family , <UNK> 's uncles , had been killed ."
"this photograph , printed in <UNK> ink , was quite unlike the usual <UNK> <UNK> of the war ."
"<#> very tall trees stood at <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> , each placed so as to compliment the overall harmony of the landscape ."
"it was impossible to tell what kind they were , but their heavy top branches seemed to bend in the wind with a tragic <UNK> ."
"the distant <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ; this side of the mountains , the <UNK> lay flat and <UNK> ."
"for the rest you saw nothing but soldiers , thousands of them ."
"in the <UNK> , they were turned away from the camera to reveal the white <UNK> hanging from their caps and the <UNK> leather <UNK> across their backs ."
"they had not formed up in neat ranks , but were <UNK> in groups , heads <UNK> ."
"a mere handful in the lower left corner had half - turned their dark faces toward the camera , like figures in a <UNK> painting ."
this light charged the entire picture with an <UNK> sense of grief .
"from these men , there <UNK> a tangible emotion that broke in a wave against the small white altar , the flowers , the <UNK> in their midst ."
i suppose these dreams are nothing more than a tribute to <UNK> 's skill as a writer .
"hell does call to hell , but perhaps the buddha said it in a nicer way : mind <UNK> its objects ."
they are mind - generated and mind - made .
"to speak and act with a <UNK> mind is to draw pain after oneself , like a wheel behind the feet of the animal drawing it ."
they are mind - generated and mind - made .
"to speak and act with a peaceful mind is to draw happiness after oneself , like an <UNK> shadow ."
well this is the first chance all day i have had to sit down and write .
my day started out waiting for the <UNK> control people to come and when they did n't show up i called the apartment complex office to ask about it .
i was told that they made a mistake on the dates and it was going to be tomorrow .
so i waited around for nothing and now have to do the whole thing over again tomorrow .
i mean i go about the day with normal things but it just seems like something is missing .
only i ca n't put my finger on it .
i did complete several candle orders today and shipped the ones from yesterday so i was very happy about that .
even though the orders keep coming in everyday it seems like there is no end .
it is such an awful feeling to be losing the race .
i woke up this morning and had the most awesome <UNK> !
grown from my very own hand from just a seed .
at the same time i woke up to my laptop acting very strange !
i have <UNK> of work to do and today is my husbands birthday .
i ca n't even give him a hug or anything else for that matter ! !
i still have so much to do before he gets home to prepare for the move
i hope he is having a good birthday even if he is so far from home .
chances are he is so busy with work that he simple does n't have much time to think about it .
the boys are so funny they woke me up so early to go outside this morning and now they are asleep again .
but of course i ca n't go back sleep !
i need to workout and get that outta the way and then i need to get busy making candles !
more later .... so much for the sun !
it is pouring rain and it looks like another ga <UNK> .
i saw the new people downstairs that are moving in and they were kind of stuck in the rain .
they were n't moving in yet just looking around .
as soon as they arrived the rain started ! !
... we already have enough grumpy people around here .
i 'm almost done with all of the orders i currently have !
it would be nice to be caught up for a day or <#> .
not that i mind the work or the money ...
i thought i would just start with posting a pic but now that it is here i 'm wondering why i ever did that ?
i know the time is going so slowly because i am so excited about the move .
since i grew up on the east coast i 'm more than ready to see what is like on the west coast .
all of the places i have visited i have loved so why should washington be any different ?
it rains <UNK> but there are n't as many bugs ! !
at moments i feel like time is standing still .
i have to say i did over shop a little .
i became very excited about some of the sales the stores i love were having .
it is also a proven fact that shopping makes you feel better and i needed that .
i ca n't wait to move ... only <#> days to go and here we come washington !
we have lots of time to spend with family in ca before and during christmas .
the hard part will be finding a place to live in wa .
i refuse to rent something before seeing it no matter how nice it look on the net .
i know that many people who are <UNK> do that but i 'm just not willing to take that chance .
"i hurt my bad leg again today , sooo i did n't do a <UNK> thing really ..."
... we have n't had any forbidden food for a long time ...
tomorrow i have to go to vancouver for <#> doctors appointments .
"eyes and skin , and i am hoping to go <UNK> hunting ..."
"rod is working nights , and when he does that , i keep his schedule , which means i stay up all night and sleep all day"
"she just turned <#> years young a few months ago , and the session went well ..."
i got a lot of good pictures of her ... she said i restored her self esteem after she saw this <#> ...
i am glad she feels better about her self .
i really enjoy taking these kind of pictures ...
i am going to try to post <#> of her pictures here ...
"yep , well at least i am going to blame her for it ..."
"i forgot the <UNK> to the last place i blogged at , so i just stopped"
"when i could n't get back in , i was busy too"
"when i stopped my last blog , i was building a doll house for our <UNK> <UNK> , i finished it , and it turned out sooo good ..."
"i wonder if i can post pictures here ... well , i guess i will find out soon enough ..."
it was so much fun to see her excited over something i had spent so much time making ... made it all worth it ...
in a few weeks rod and i are going to tx to fix up the house for day rental ...
i ca n't wait to see my little <UNK> tyler ...
its hard living so far away when you know there is a baby growing up with out being able to see it happening ...
i 'll get serious with this thing later ... right now i 'm in testing mode ...
"someone is always bound for hell , and lately apparently i am the <#> !"
"now anyone that knows me , or see 's my website , knows that i am obviously into and curious about the <UNK> ."
it has been a passion of mine for almost a decade .
it likely shall remain that for the duration of my journey on this earth .
"it is not only an enjoyment , but a source of relaxation for me ."
"ok , and it might slightly border on an obsession ."
now i really do nt care that there are <UNK> out there that think i am a bit odd .
"that is their choice , much as this is mine ."
"i accept that they are closed minded , they should accept that i am not ."
just who do these self righteous folks think they are ? ?
"most of whom , by the way , claim to be fine <UNK> christians !"
"i wish to remind them first and foremost that according to the bible , god is a spirit as well !"
".... let me also remind them of the biblical passage on passing judgement : matthew <UNK> "" judge not , that ye be not judged . """
"in other words people , sweep around your own front door before telling me how dirty mine is !"
i also wish to ask them why are you telling me what a christian you are ?
it has always been my belief that a true christian does not need to <UNK> their christianity constantly to other people .
"not because i go to church everytime the doors are open ,"
"- i do not - not because i run around constantly telling others i am ,"
"- i do not - not because a preacher tells me i must be , but because of my personal relationship with god !"
"it is personal , and frankly , i feel is no <#> elses business ."
i need no <#> else to be a christian .
do i think i am going to hell based on the fact that i chase after knowledge of the spirit world ?
uh ........... no ! am i <UNK> god by doing this ?
am i out in <UNK> practicing the black arts or <UNK> satan ?
"so please , <#> more time , what exactly is my sin , that god can not or will not forgive in this ? ?"
my suggestion to all those who fear i am damned to hell by being a <UNK> <UNK> : stay away from me !
"if i am such the <UNK> , then simply do not grace me with your <UNK> <UNK> or your <UNK> words !"
"after all , you would nt want to accidentally slip and follow me !"
"he had a gambling and drinking problem , we often would not have money for groceries , and i would have to go to local food <UNK> ."
"but , i always found a way to make sure my kid 's had what they needed ."
"i could not have any friends , he would call me at work several times during the day to make sure i was there ."
"if the house was not <UNK> , he would let me have it later ."
"if he was not given sex , it was hell to pay , so to protect us i would just lay there and cry until it was over ."
"financially i was in big <UNK> not get help from the state , so would have to borrow money to pay the rent or buy groceries ."
"he is a big kid , right now is <UNK> and <UNK> <#> and is only <#> ."
i 'm <UNK> and weigh <#> when i 've been eating right .
i lied to him and said we were going to get breakfast before school .
"i kept thinking that they were going to say i was a bad mom , take him away from me ect ect ."
"but once there it took <#> security guards to get him out of the car , then <#> nurses and <#> doctors to strap him to the bed ."
"then , they called me into a private room , and asked me what he has been <UNK> told them everything ."
"the doctor called in a nurse , and gave me a gown , and asked me to put it on ."
"i was very confused , but did it anyway ( still hearing my son screaming and saying he was going to kill everyone there in the hallway ) ."
when they came back into the room they asked me to let them see the bruises .
"he was there for a week , they gave him anti <UNK> and sent him on his way ."
"we went to counseling every week , but the meds were not working , i kept telling the dr"
the police have been called to our apt several times and they said if they come back again they are taking him .
"they would walk in , and look right at him and say "" what did you do to your mom now "" ."
"they knew , they saw , but i begged and <UNK> with them not to take him ."
he would not be put in a <UNK> home .
"maybe a mental hospital for help , but that would be the last extreme ."
"my heart <UNK> , i almost felt like i was going to faint ."
"i brought the article in to my doctor , and told him everything , and said i 'm not getting any help with these others ..."
"he became a different person then , leaving me at home <UNK> out until <#> am ."
the abuse started about a year after my daughter was born .
"i never told anyone , as all i had heard before was "" we would never make <UNK>"
i believed that since i never had a dad that my daughter needed
"i just fought back , trying to keep my family together , <UNK> the violence , doing my best to keep her away from it ."
"<#> years later , i woke up <#> morning , and again had something just "" break "" inside of me ."
"i made coffee , called my mom , told her i was leaving him and that i needed help in moving out today ."
"he just sat there in total <UNK> were moved out by <#> pm that day , moved in with my <UNK> i filed for divorce the next day ."
<#> of the neighbors called the police <#> morning at <#> am and told them there were <#> children left home alone all of the time .
they gave my mom a break ( feeling sorry for her i guess ) but told her she needed to find a <UNK> .
she asked <#> of her ex - boyfriend 's mother to watch us .
she was around <UNK> we loved her to pieces .
"my mother picked us up the next morning , and around <#> pm on christmas <UNK> "" called and said she had passed away in her sleep ."
"nightmares for months , crying in the middle of class ."
"then <#> night while we were back at his house , he came into the room where my brother and i slept ."
"that night , is when he started preparing me for what was to come ."
"he started buying me drugs , keeping me high the entire time i was with him ."
he ended up <UNK> <UNK> me on year later .
i ran away the next day and was gone for about a week before the police found me .
"<UNK> every word he said , i still never told <UNK> begged my mom not to send us back there ."
"i met a guy from school , that basically "" took me in "" ."
"i was n't in love with him , but he was with me ."
"his family was very screwed up , his dad was addicted to <UNK> , and they had to move from state to state in order to get his drug ."
they decided they were going to move to cali in <UNK> me i could go with <UNK> i packed up my things and did .
we got married in cali in <UNK> i became pregnant with my daughter in <#> .
"we moved several times , within those times she went into <UNK> on a bar with that friend we had lived with ."
"by then she had married an evil <UNK> a son , and within a month of having him he walked out on her ."
"he hated me with a passion , he did n't work , so during that last summer of him living with us"
"soon , i just stopped coming home until i saw my mom driving down the street at <#> pm ."
"but , he was gone , and we have never to this day heard from him again ."
"she started drinking , bringing a different man home almost <UNK> after the bar closed ."
in awhile we would wake up and a strange man would be in our kitchen .
"i never trusted them , men to me were scary , and i did n't want any part of them ."
it was nt until i was <#> that i found out how scary they really could be .
"i , to this day still question that , how did i survive ?"
"it was almost like something inside of me took <UNK> and pulled me through the dark <UNK> , or turned me down the right road ."
"since by then i was in and out of foster homes , the state was glad to get me off of their list ."
i have had to learn that hard way that they are not .
"bringing me presents , sitting with me and reading me stories , helping my mom with money and groceries ."
when i was n't with my grandparents my life was alot different .
i remember feeling like i was always in the way with my mom .
"so i learned to "" disappear "" until it was time for supper , then i would take my shower and go to bed right away ."
"amazing as i know have <#> kids of my own , and i know where they are every second ."
"i ca n't imagine not knowing where you child is , having them gone all day ."
"i do n't remember birthday parties , i do nt ' remember christmas ."
maybe i have blocked all of those things out .
those were the days that you could leave your keys in the car in your driveway .
you never had to worry to much about <UNK> or child <UNK> <UNK> on your children while they played outside .
we all ate dinner together usually at the same time every evening .
i was <#> and my mother had told me i was n't allowed to date until i was <#> .
"it was march , <#> months before my 16th b - day ."
for the <#> months before march i had been seeing john <UNK> my mother knowing .
finally giving in she told me john and i could go out .
i wo n't bore you with the details but lets say i left that <UNK> with cherry still intact .
i was never really told too much about sex .
so fear was the only feeling i had towards it .
"i continued through life <UNK> with alot of things <UNK> to the title of this blog , you know sex , drugs , and rock - n - roll ."
the only <#> that really messed me up was the drugs .
it started out small with a joint here and there with friends then soon it was a line of this or a line of that .
little by little i was <UNK> on these things to make me feel good and to <UNK> the pain of alot of hurts that were tearing me apart inside .
i went on through life thinking that this was the only way to cope with what life dealt to me .
the only thing that came out of it that was good was <#> of my <#> beautiful children .
he <UNK> got worse over the <#> years we were together .
the final straw was when he decided that we could n't live in society anymore
so he had this wonderful idea that we were going to move way up north and live off the land .
"to make a long story <UNK> and my <#> kids , ages <#> , <UNK> found ourselves running through <UNK> forest to get away from him ."
we managed to hide from him in some bushes along the side of the first road we came to .
"i was just about to give up hope , scratching the numerous <UNK> bites we had gotten waiting in the bush , when i heard a noise ."
we were <UNK> by the wisconsin state police and we returned home to my family <UNK> shortly <UNK> .
i continued on what i call now my slow road to suicide but it failed i lived .
i have been clean now for almost <#> years .
i have experienced things that would make a normal persons hair curl .
"i guess the message i a trying to send out is "" <UNK> is for <UNK> """
""" <UNK> do drugs "" take it from an expert who knows ."
"if we stick to the normally accepted <UNK> , we find the <UNK> ( a.k.a ."
"throughout history , brilliant ideas and various forms of “ ‘"
"<UNK> have come into being and out , into <UNK> and out but sadly or fortunately , none have really stood the test of time ."
"what is this , yet - another - <UNK> for ?"
i wrote this after collecting some thoughts as i became slowly interested in economics .
"over time as i learned more about it , i became completely and utterly <UNK> ."
"those left out or <UNK> or left - behind , will strike - back – unfortunately this is an historical fact ."
the people not included hit back at the “ evil ” that kept them down .
"right or wrong , good or bad , and why for are really irrelevant –"
trying to write a job application and damn thing falls - over all the time .
"german is hard enough for a native speaker , but writing <#> plus pages in the language and then having disappear in seconds is beyond frustrating ."
there 's nothing ever really special planned for this blog site .
it 's just an interesting experiment for me .
was visiting a few friends in historical swiss city of <UNK> .
<UNK> is <#> of the remaining examples of a <UNK> city in europe .
"beat and michael took me swimming and put me on a * $ "" <UNK> <UNK> ! ! !"
anyway - i survived - even if i was all wet ! ! !
urllink watch the new ad showing john <UNK> asking george bush to apologize for attacking <UNK> 's own <UNK> record .
"urllink tell george bush : stop the <UNK> , get back to the issues ."
"they did it to john <UNK> in <#> , to max <UNK> in <#> , and now they are doing it to john kerry ."
the question must be asked of president bush : what do you have against vietnam veterans ?
view the ad by visiting : urllink <UNK> today we 're calling for all of you to join together and stand with john kerry .
"tell george bush : stop the <UNK> , get back to the issues ."
"through his silence , george bush is <UNK> their action ."
and bush campaign officials in florida are even promoting events for this front group .
"in fact , all of john kerry 's performance reports ( available on our website ) display an absolutely <UNK> record of service ."
"they <UNK> <UNK> attacks , <#> wave after another , and it is n't going to stop ."
everybody needs to see our ad and reflect on how our country can do better .
"we need you to get the truth out by <UNK> this email to your friends , family and co - workers ."
first real rain we have had since wow march maybe ?
this is my first entry into my blog and since i am really tired its going to be short and sweet !
today is a day looks like made for staying <UNK> most of the day and maybe cleaning up .
my daughter just suggested that we go swimming while its raining .
myself personally i went truly <UNK> and brought some <UNK> total cost £ <#> :-)
"it 's raining , i must be on holiday :-)"
"everyone here is fighting for the bathroom , except jack he is still in bed ."
the plan is off to london today for a shopping trip .
"me thinks that the first purchase will be a rain coat or an umbrella , then we can shop for real ."
"not sure if i should take the camera or not , if i do any we get anything of any worth i will post it later this evening ."
so what exciting things have i done on the first day of my holiday ?
still we have the rest of the week and they have lived in pots for ages so <#> or <#> more days wo n't hurt them .
"the plan is for london tomorrow shopping , stay tuned for more events of extreme excitement"
"urllink <UNK> it 's the first day of my week off and i think that my site needs a <UNK> , especially the photo area ."
"i would have preferred to have been out and about but in traditional english <UNK> it 's raining , well it is summer :-)"
been doing a little browsing for things to do in the comming weeks vacation .
"i had better sign off and get some more work done and maybe a little more browsing , who knows ."
urllink it took a while but we now have photos .
"ok , only <#> but it 's a start ."
"i do n't know that i have , but it sure looks like it : another tag ."
"the first "" tag "" i ever bumped into had been attached to my great - great grandmother martha a. <UNK> <UNK> ."
i found a woman doing work on the <UNK> and shared information .
"she told me that martha 's middle name was "" <UNK> "" ."
"i thought "" how fun ! "" and put it in my notes ."
"her "" <UNK> "" being more important than the ( likely ) truth !"
as a <UNK> it can be so hard to get accurate information that i really could n't believe what she was saying .
she must have felt that same frustration of knowing you were dancing around a ' truth ' you could n't prove .
"her work is really good , and she was always very generous with it ."
"for years i 've dealt with "" jane <UNK> <UNK> "" and i 've been trying to find her in the <#> <UNK> without any luck ."
"... then bill said , "" well , those names are kind of similar , are n't they ? """
so i sat down immediately to really find her in <#> .
this time the record was perfectly clear : <UNK> j. <UNK> ( should have been edwards ) .
"looking at the <#> <UNK> again it looks like "" <UNK> "" ."
she had an aunt named <UNK> ( now i 'm thinking <UNK> ? ) .
"in any case , clearly the "" <UNK> "" ( which was her mother 's name ) is completely wrong ."
"again , the <UNK> who said her middle name was "" <UNK> "" was a good <UNK> with lots of stuff and she shared it ."
"it lent credibility to her statement , though i had not seen even a "" t. "" , suggesting that she would be on the right track ."
she might really think jane 's middle name was <UNK> .
"in any case , the real lesson is that <UNK> is always a good <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> ... but you can almost understand the <UNK> ."
i ca n't count the number of times i 've seen people use my conclusions as their own without giving me any credit .
"it does n't bother me , but it is rude , <UNK> and counter - productive ."
"if you source is your aunt <UNK> , put her name ( or <UNK> ) with it . and the date ."
"if it 's a will , put that . and the county it was written in and the date ."
it will help everyone who works on that line .
"read the sources , people . and put them in your own work ."
"his second wife <UNK> was also listed as being from georgia , but i finally found their marriage record by pure chance in <UNK> co. , arkansas in <#> ."
"i was looking for the record of another family entirely and noticed the "" <UNK> , <UNK> . """
"she was too young to be the mother of any of these children , but i 'd imagined they 'd gotten married in georgia at any rate ."
after finding that record i began looking a little closer to ft .
"the <UNK> were n't spot on , but they never are , are they ?"
that was the original relief : finding them all together in <#> . and
"not too far away was john c. <UNK> and living with him and his large family was "" jane <UNK> <#> born in pennsylvania "" ."
"john and his family eventually ended up in newton county , missouri , where william the younger married <UNK> trent ."
"it was in an old <UNK> posting that i found a woman looking for "" william lance and <UNK> trent <UNK> "" ."
"now , i had seen his many <UNK> <UNK> , and they were <UNK> "" william v. or <UNK> . """
", so i thought , huh , must be william <UNK> ..."
"hamilton <UNK> <UNK> : <UNK> no <#> , <UNK> ."
""" <UNK> "" was a nickname for jane ... very , very tricky of them !"
"here is a link to part of his work for the urllink <UNK> baptist church of <UNK> , near <UNK> , scott county , arkansas . and"
i 'm a confirmed <UNK> nut and have been since the age of <#> .
"it was about that time that my grandmother started doing <UNK> , and while i did n't ever go with her when she did her research"
", i did get to look at all the "" family group sheets "" that she shared with my mother ."
"i would sit and stare at them , trying to memorize the names , and then write out the family relationships in different ways on yellow legal pads ."
"that 's a complicated thing to "" see "" ."
"later , i got a master 's degree in history and worked at a state historical society as a <UNK> ."
"without it , i would n't have much more than family stories , so i 'm a big <UNK> of free , online <UNK> resources ."
... they 've got more meat on them anyway .
"ah heh , ah heh - heh , heh ."
"anyway ... urllink <UNK> 's journey -- this is me , and my daughter , and my friends and stuff ."
urllink <UNK> house -- this is where i live .
urllink <UNK> park -- this is where i work .
urllink victoria gathering of imaginary friends urllink san francisco visit and lake <UNK> gathering of imaginary friends .
"i work , i come home , i read , i sleep ."
"read "" songs of the <UNK> nation -- my journey through <UNK> "" -- wow ."
"taking angela to the zoo after that was kind of painful , as i could see some of the animals were clearly not happy ."
"the <UNK> stood with its face to a <UNK> in the wall of its <UNK> , which it had probably dug or <UNK> itself ."
"the <UNK> <UNK> did endless laps of <#> portion of their fence line , having worn a channel where they go back and forth , back and forth ."
"the tiger <UNK> <UNK> , as far from the <UNK> crowd as possible ."
would you walk over and pose for a person who was acting that way towards you ?
"the black bear in disguise ( it was white ) seemed content to play in its <UNK> <UNK> , but then it 's still young ."
its mother had been hit by a car and it was brought to the zoo because it would not have survived on its own .
i imagine it will spend the rest of its life in <UNK> .
but on the other hand i would n't want to see them in <UNK> any more than i 'd want to be in <#> .
the white tigers ( main reason we went ) were nice .
"they 're a traveling display , here til october , and i knew angela would love them ."
"the big cats were my favourite too , though i wish the snow <UNK> would have come out while we were there , and the <UNK> bear ."
i wonder if we 'll be able to keep a <UNK> bear population alive after their <UNK> is gone ?
"the <UNK> house at the australian exhibit was nice , various pretty birds doing their thing behind glass ."
i could have sat there and watched them for a while .
i wish i could wave a magic <UNK> and <UNK> all the bad things in the world .

just enough to block the wind but not enough to keep out the cold .
i know he 's just around the corner if only i can stare hard enough .
( <UNK> ) <#> ) i am a strange flower rooted with <UNK> <UNK> that hurt when i am pulled up <UNK> with no tears to water me .
"come now , <UNK> , wee but true , how can i find the ' me ' in you ?"
"darling <UNK> , trusted friend , show me how i best may end my time within this prison wall -- how can i make the barrier fall ?"
"february <#> -- after i woke i drew a picture of the street scene , but i was n't able to truly capture the image from my dream ."
"but first , i wrote this to get the whole thing down before it faded ."
"<UNK> i 've just had the most amazing , vivid dream ."
"i was sitting on my mother 's bed , looking at a poster that mark had brought back from his travels ."
"it was a european city scene , with large fancy letters <UNK> over it that looked to me as if they spelled "" madrid "" ."
"suddenly , i found myself standing on a sidewalk , looking into a shop window that very closely <UNK> the poster in some way ."
"i realized that i had been <UNK> somehow to a real european city , but i did n't know where ."
"i figured at first that it must be madrid , considering the text on the poster , but i was n't sure ."
"i started walking down the street , looking at the people around me and trying to identify the <UNK> of them and the buildings and <UNK> i passed ."
"i went closer to get a good look at the ruin , which turned into a fountain by the time i reached it ."
"a small boy , similarly <UNK> , <UNK> around the fountain placing candles in small glass dishes <UNK> about the fountain ."
"it looked like preparation for some ritual or performance , but what i could n't tell ."
"i walked back towards the window at which i had arrived , wondering how i would get back home ."
"it did n't seem like spain , anyway , from what i could tell ."
"i saw a gold purse with a chain lying on the sidewalk , people walking past it without a glance ."
"i picked it up , and found inside an address -- somewhere in america , i ca n't remember ."
"i <UNK> "" oh good , i 'll know where to send it "" and carried it with me ."
"as i was standing on a corner waiting to cross a street , a woman asked me if i was canadian ."
"i said i live in canada , and she said she thought so ."
i do n't know how she had concluded that .
"i reached a bridge that looked <UNK> , so i was sure i 'd passed the window where i had arrived ."
"i looked down over the edge of the bridge at house , probably an apartment building , with large , broad <UNK> covered with <UNK> ."
"i must have found my way back to the window somehow , because i was back home again ."
"i was describing the adventure to mark , who said that the poster was his "" unhappy "" poster , or something to that effect ."
"a couple of brief <UNK> of my sleep later , and we were both back in the same city ."
"we passed a window , and mark wondered aloud if <UNK> 's would let him sit and read in their store ."
"i looked up , and sure enough , it was a <UNK> 's ."
i still did n't know where we were .
"the ruin was n't there , nor the fountain that had replaced it in my first adventure ."
"we did , however , find a park filled with many <UNK> trees ."
"it was somewhat <UNK> , like a sour patch kid ."
"i thought to ask if he needed help , but figured that if i <UNK> him by calling out , he might drop the boat ."
"i rather liked the idea , as it was a very pleasant place to be and i would have enjoyed staying there for some time ."
"i 've been paying particular attention to my dreams lately , looking for <UNK> to my life , possible messages , spirit guides , and the like ."
<#> such dream about a month or so ago had me crossing a large bridge with my mother -- or trying to cross it .
"we came to the bridge , which was on a very busy street full of cars ."
"the right - hand <UNK> path had <UNK> holes in it , too large to jump across , so we crossed the street to take the other side ."
"access to this <UNK> was partially blocked by the branch of a nearby tree , which had grown down over the edge of the path ."
i remember thinking that it ought to be <UNK> back a bit .
"i was terrified to step onto it , and once i did , i wanted to cross it as quickly as possible ."
"my mother told me to lean out and look over the edge , that there was a flag on a house down below that i should see ."
"i did not want to lean out over the edge , since the <UNK> was <UNK> at such a sharp angle that i felt sure i would fall off ."
"i have to ask myself -- what am i trying to show myself , what am i afraid to look at , and why ?"
<UNK> dream -- winter <#> or spring <#> ?
"i <UNK> on the waves , <UNK> among a <UNK> collection of hand drums ."
"i took up the next drum that came my way , entered the circle of sound briefly , and then sent it on its way again ."
"at that moment , i felt the <UNK> begin to pull me away from the shore ."
"i immediately swam against it , and quickly <UNK> the <UNK> pull enough to reach the shore ."
it was then that i saw my group heading just over the edge of the <UNK> visible <UNK> and out of sight .
"i <UNK> up my <UNK> where it lay on the edge of the sandy beach , and ran after them ."
"the only <#> that were still <UNK> were already full , and several of us were left stranded on the beach ."
"as we <UNK> back into the centre of the small island , the other group appeared around us ."
the feeling of <UNK> in the air increased .
i noticed the setting sun at approximately the same moment that i realised what would happen when it set .
"they were waiting until then to eat us - me , actually ."
"he released me after only a moment ’s painful sucking , and <UNK> <UNK> up at me with sharp teeth stained red ."
i picked him up and threw him <UNK> away from me .
"i didn’t wait to hear more -- thought , decision and action were all <#> at that moment ."
"i took <#> steps and dove straight out into the dark water , where i could sense something <UNK> horrible <UNK> somewhere ."
"for the longest brief moment i lay <UNK> in the grip of sleep <UNK> , before i began to <UNK> and weep ."
----- the things that strike me as most significant about this dream are the details regarding acting on my own behalf .
"normally in dreams i suffer from extreme physical <UNK> whenever strength or speed are required , especially when trying to defend myself from or escape danger ."
any <UNK> movement on my own behalf is like trying to swim <UNK> through <UNK> .
"i am also usually unable to get myself organised enough to do whatever it is that needs to be done , especially if i am late getting somewhere ."
i can never seem to “ get my shit together ” enough to just go .
"the amount of <UNK> i <UNK> amazes me , as i am frequently not only helpless , but also <UNK> in my dreams ."
"this dream <UNK> more <UNK> , positive action on my own behalf than all of my dreams put together , that i can recall ."
"even <UNK> it months later , i am overwhelmed by the feelings it <UNK> in me ."
"i will hold onto this feeling of positive <UNK> , for when i need it in real life ."
i say this with some <UNK> because it always <UNK> the usual “
"i’m sorry , ” from the the listener , regardless of whether they knew mom or not ."
"yes , indeed the passing of a loved <#> , especially a parent , is always a sad thing , but mom had been ill for quite some time ."
"for the last couple of years , she was not the person that i remembered , nor the person that she wanted to be ."
going through the grief process is something that everyone must do in their own way and in their own time .
"as the only child of my <UNK> <#> year marriage , it was left to me to deal with mom ’s <UNK> ."
"complicated by the fact that my own family was moving into a new home , the process of <UNK> and sorting seemed never ending ."
"she had so many hobbies over her lifetime , and i was now the <UNK> of so many of these “ <UNK> ."
"” most of the things were bits and pieces of her life for which i had no use or desire , except for that occasional <UNK> ."
"however , there was <#> item that i had always dreamed of <UNK> ever since i was a little girl ."
i prayed that he had not thought this <#> item too small and <UNK> to save for me .
"finally , however , today i opened a box and sitting there so <UNK> was the item i had been searching and hoping to find ."
"so seemingly <UNK> and <UNK> as it sat in the bottom of that box , it contained so many of my childhood memories ."
i removed the box of buttons and sat on the floor to receive my gift .
mom had been a professional <UNK> for most of her life .
so much of her time was spent in her sewing room doing <UNK> for other people and sewing precious stitches of love for me .
i remembered all of the people that passed through that room and the friendships that came and went through the years .
"for quite some time , mom had also designed costumes for a local theater company , and i remembered all of the interesting people and beautiful costumes ."
"i grew up in that room , playing with blocks and <UNK> , then moving to <UNK> as i got older ."
"however , the most special treat was always when i was allowed to play with mom ’s button collection ."
"i don’t know what the attraction was for me , but i suspect it had something to do with all the beautiful colors and shapes ."
i loved to let them <UNK> through my fingers as other children might do with sand .
i was never allowed to just take them from the shelf without permission .
permission to play with the buttons was always a gift that mom gave me .
"mom probably never knew how much those buttons meant to me , but perhaps she did"
and that was the reason she always presented them to me to play with as a queen might present the crown <UNK> .
there are buttons in that jar that <UNK> like diamonds and those were always my favorite when i was a child .
"there are buttons from favorite clothing , long <UNK> and <UNK> , except for those few saved buttons ."
"i don’t remember mom ever taking any buttons from that box to use , but it continued to grow and grow throughout my childhood ."
"i picked out my favorites time and time again , always changing ."
i would try to find all of the buttons of a particular style or design .
"as i grew up , married , and had my own daughter , i also began to <UNK> , but try as i might"
i couldn’t seem to build a button collection like mom ’s .
"as mom became more and more <UNK> and my own life became more busy , i asked less frequently for the buttons ."
"her sewing room began to gather dust and , finally , the sewing machine sat quiet and still ."
"in her last few years , mom was <UNK> to less active hobbies , and the button box became a sad reminder of those better times ."
"however , i never forgot that they were there , waiting for mom to <UNK> them upon me that <#> final precious time ."
"it was a time i dreaded , but also knew would come and eventually , it did ."
i wonder as i sit on the floor today what my daughter will take the most pleasure in receiving from me .
will it be something i treasure myself or perhaps it might be an item that i have given little thought but holds special memories for her ?
"perhaps it is something that i already have , or more likely something that i’m yet to acquire ."
another of the items i received when mom passed away was a glass <UNK> cabinet .
"however , sitting inside that cabinet , in the most honored place in my home , are mom ’s buttons . . ."
go to urllink <UNK> for more info .
the ones where you 'd read about some dead person and then have to answer various questions to test your reading <UNK> skills ?

"well , i 'm taking it upon myself to <UNK> you on various interesting women ... and you wo n't be <UNK> on them afterwards ."

on friday evening i received an email from my friend jen with a link to her blog ( go to urllink <UNK> to view ) .
"however , i had no idea that relatively normal folk could just get <#> up and running ( not that jen is by any means relatively normal , nor --"
i hope -- am i ) . but something about reading her blog -- coupled with the fact that i 've been doing more reading vs. writing lately and
"it 's sort of starting to freak me out , and a burst of self - obsessed <UNK> where i was overcome with the ( mistaken ? )"

"there are no tricks to it , no dead ends or <UNK> - de - <UNK> , no <UNK> paths ."
"<UNK> , on the other hand , are <UNK> ."
"they offer a choice of paths , some with many <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"that 's not how she explained it ... because a gorgeous , <UNK> funny brit probably would n't use words like "" <UNK> . """
"so the whole <UNK> vs. <UNK> thing is sort of like fate vs. free will , i guess ."
moral of the story : it ai n't over ' til it 's over .
something i remind myself of approximately <#> times a day .
and then i thought about how i saw <UNK> de <UNK> 's <UNK> at the met recently and how blown away i was by it ....
go to urllink <UNK> for more on de <UNK> .

i am so happy to have today off work . by the time work
"was over yesterday , i felt emotionally spent ."
"the women i work with are such "" bitches "" well at least most of them ."
"i have shared many of my life 's secrets with her and she does nt judge me , it is so nice to have a special friend like that !"
today i took a vacation day because i am taking my children to register for school .
"they will get their schedules , order <UNK> , and get school pictures done ."
"my daughter is especially excited because she has lost <UNK> and looks terrific , that along with getting contact lens 's really has <UNK> her self esteem ."
tonight i have to take her to 9th grade orientation and she ca nt wait to see the expressions of peoples faces .
"last night the <UNK> and i watched "" <UNK> "" let me tell you save your money !"
"i had such a nice weekend , i really do nt feel like putting in <#> hours today ."
"we put the new <UNK> up , painted the shed floor and installed a new security light , and still had time to watch a movie :"
"talking lives ......... a very <UNK> movie with alot of twists , needless to say i liked it ."
there really is so much grey matter is n't there ?
"my view on certain issues , and i am working on it , tends to be a bit more <UNK> ."
is it so wrong though to ask for something black or white ? something <UNK> ?
i have a particular issue that i need that on .
""" i do n't know that i will ever get that ."
it is <#> of those things that just <UNK> out there in waiting .
"<#> site i saw , they talked about how timing was their <UNK> ."
it seems to be thrown back at me on a constant <UNK> .
sometimes it feels as if i am walking in circles and i keep coming back to the same road with a huge <UNK> blocking the path .
the question has been posed to me as to if or why i <UNK> done any community theatre .
the first part of that question is an easy <#> .
i have n't done any community theatre to date .
it has been on my mind more and more this past year .
the second part of that question is where i had to think on it a bit .
there are many reasons i could give for why i have n't .
but where is the line between an excuse or a justified reason ?
it is only this past year that i have gotten back to who i am .
"sort of swept up in the expectations of what i "" should "" do ."
and that is what i thought my path was going to be .
i almost did n't feel like i was allowed to pursue something that would be <UNK> to me . not that my daughter was n't <UNK> .
but i am talking about that stuff inside of you that you just love to do .
i let a lot of that go when i was younger .
"i figured there just was n't time , after all , i had responsibilities ."
i <UNK> my hopes and dreams up to silly childhood fantasies .
"so , here i am ... just turned <#> and am now realizing that they were n't silly fantasies ."
"that i can make them a reality , if even in just a small way ."
so i will be doing community theatre this next season .
"i was part of play production and as such , we put on all the performances in our school ."
"of course , it helped that my best friend william was also the director ."
i like to think that they were well deserved and i actually had some talent .
we did win some state wide <UNK> so i could n't have been all that bad .
"i think it all started for me , my love for the arts , when i was in middle school ."
"i had dance classes , choir , music appreciation , film production and editing , drama , paint and writing ."
i feel fortunate now that i had that experience .
i think my favorite then was drama and film production .
"i had to produce , film , block and edit it myself ."
if i remember right i got a good grade on it .
"although , i did continue my theatre training in college , i never <UNK> it seriously ."
i had always wanted to be on broadway though .
my name in lights etc ... sometimes dreams are better when they are left as such .
but life has its way of making <UNK> to what we think is going to happen or have planned .
"i am <UNK> , there is always community theatre right ?"
i thought i would post something that gave some insight to who i am .
"if you ever read any of my future posts ' , i may leave you wondering "" what the heck was that about ! """
"especially , when you have become accustomed to believing that honesty is the best policy ."
"someone once told me , not too long ago , that i was so honest that it was painfully so ."
"basically , i crossed the line and hurt him ."
"so , it has been my task to find a balance ."
somewhere in the middle where i can communicate without <UNK> it down someones throat .
"letting someone know my truth and have it be just that , my truth and nothing more ."
there are so many things that touch my life .
"some others would be ... my music ... """
"all music has something to offer "" is what i have always said ."
"my collection has been referred to as <UNK> , weird and interesting ."
it is what makes me tick and talks to me in ways that reach all the different aspects of me .
my growth ... is a life long journey for me i am realizing .
books have been my best friend this past couple years .
"i am not <#> for reading fiction , although , it 's what i crave to write ."
"well , i guess this would be my "" first post "" as it were ."
i learned of this site quite some time ago but never actually knew someone that did it until recently .
i had tried other <UNK> in the past for my writing but they lacked the <UNK> i suppose .
i think i wanted something with a little more freedom of expression versus the constant <UNK> on what i had written in a <UNK> sense .
"i have a journal that i write in daily , however it is pretty raw stuff ."
and i mean raw ... ugly ... <UNK> ... and hopeful .
"whatever end of the spectrum of emotions <#> can <UNK> , is what s there ."
"i sometimes go back to read past thoughts and am puzzled by my own expressions , sometimes frightened by them ."
i am hoping this will give me some more <UNK> in my writing but with the freedom i crave as well .
"put the chicken wings , about a dozen , split into drums and <UNK> into a <UNK> bag ."
"pour in the lemon water , add the <UNK> ."
pop in a bowl ( in case it <UNK> ) and set in fridge for about hour .
drain off <UNK> and continue with chosen cooking process .
"<UNK> makes the chicken <UNK> , more tender and it just has a better flavor all around ."
"it does n't take much time or effort , and the <UNK> already has the <UNK> <UNK> into it , so you can add just about anything ."
i have found that the options listed above work pretty good .
<UNK> the onion if you do n't like it .
"leave out the lemon pepper , substitute it for something else ."
"you really ca n't leave out the soy though , that 's pretty important for the salt ."
i would n't leave wings in this longer than <#> hours .
today i prepare for a <UNK> and an <UNK> .
"which means tomorrow morning , i will ( hopefully ) be knocked silly by really good drugs and be <UNK> from both ends ."
"the prep for such an event , is not pretty , first , do n't eat anything during the day ."
consume <#> snack packs in <#> minutes ( give the orange <#> 's to your mom ) .
"listen to your stomach complain , tell it it does n't know how good it has it right now ."
"come home from work and proceed to work with food , knowing full well that you ca n't have any of it ."
proceed to take the tips off of <#> lbs .
"of chicken wings , freeze this for future <UNK> <UNK> ."
split wings into <UNK> and <UNK> and then pop them into a bag for a quick <UNK> .
"you 're already ahead of the game , cause you made up a big batch of wing <UNK> the night before , go you !"
let the wings sit for an hour in the <UNK> and watch some olympics ( <UNK> <UNK> ) .
"melt butter , coat wings and put in the oven ."
"start to consume , as quickly as possible the most disgusting , foul , nasty tasting water you have ever had ."
"yeah , i am not amused , and i bet holly would n't be either ."
"suck this back as fast as you can , gasp for breath between <UNK> ."
quickly suck on a <UNK> to kill the taste .
"i am not <#> to gag in general , but this stuff makes me start making noises that even the cats look at me funny for . and"
then my wife looks at me all sad and says that she would drink this for me if she could .
"but hey , she promised to do the "" poop clear cheer "" for me later on , so <UNK> !"
"and now my guts are <UNK> , and the house smells like tasty chicken wings and i ca n't have any ."
"i ca n't have anything other than another tasty , lip <UNK> glass of <UNK> ( yum ! ) and a mint . and a cigarette ."
"can i say that my mouth tastes so , so very nasty ?"
so not letting my wife kiss me anytime soon .
"<UNK> , bubble , the <UNK> do not like this <UNK> that has been forced on them , and quite frankly , neither do i. this sucks ."
there 's just no way around how sucky this is . and this is n't the first time i 've had to do it either .
"in fact , i think this is my 3rd , or 4th time ."
"i 've been lucky and not had to go under the scope since my surgery in <#> , so , cross fingers , everything will look good tomorrow ."
i 'm waiting for my body to stop doing what it 's doing so i can take a shower .
"the hospital always wants you to be clean when you show up , even if you ca n't use <UNK> ( i do n't understand it either ) ."
"after the event takes place , i 've been <UNK> that i must have a responsible driver there , because i will not be allowed to drive ."
"i also should n't smoke by myself or plan on signing any legal documents tomorrow , while i 'm under the influence of these drugs ."
i can only assume i will go home with both my kidney 's intact .
"so how bout we form a search party and go investigate my <UNK> , okay ?"
""" always fun to start a new relationship off naked in a butt <UNK> gown with someone you hardly knows finger up your butt . sigh ."
"in my family practice clinic , i have a lot of good days as my nurse and i <UNK> through the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> that cross my path ."
"in this culture of fast food and <#> - <UNK> , that has been the <UNK> of customer service ."
people are used to ordering in a loud voice thru a drive through <UNK> .
"they are everywhere , <UNK> , banks , dry cleaning , and even the big red drive - thru beer barn on the <UNK> side of my town ."
"in the old fashioned world of the office of a family practice doctor , we are still <UNK> to the exercise of face to face communication ."
is this really the kind of relationship you want with some people who have the potential to really help you or hurt you ?
"if i was a lazy person , i could just write out whatever drugs people felt they needed ."
"in fact , i could just install a <UNK> machine and people would just insert their credit cards and then push a button ."
"i am a slow <UNK> , last <#> to get the cd player type , and i am going for the blog ."
that really stuck in my brain and i am not sure that is even right . but
"it made me think about how rich <UNK> we americans are , yet so often we think we lack so much ."
a single person making $ <#> a month in my town <UNK> for <UNK> assistance at our local hospital .
"considering how much medical care can cost , that is probably <UNK> ."
"<UNK> are <UNK> at <#> % and get free health care , but apparently you have to bring your own cotton <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"as i watched more olympics , i noticed some of the <UNK> representing foreign countries were actually american ( living here ) ."
i further understood the <UNK> hate <UNK> for americans around the world .
we are <#> of the few countries in the world that people want to come to live and work in .
we are not a country that many people leave or that a government has to fence in or shoot at when escaping .
but what i think americans often need to be reminded of is that material wealth does n't necessarily promise happiness .
"i saw it in the faces of a <UNK> <UNK> who did a really great routine , joy ."
i just wished that they could have looked more well - <UNK> like the americans .
"and it also turns out the the <UNK> "" tax cuts for the rich "" is nothing more than liberals playing the class envy card yet again ."
urllink <UNK> : tax cuts made system more progressive liberals like to point out that the tax cuts benefit the wealthy <UNK> in terms of dollars .
", almost any tax cut will put a lot more dollars in the hands of the top <#> % of income <UNK> than it will anyone else ."
it 's because the top <#> % of income <UNK> who are paying the lion 's share of the taxes .
"according to the urllink <UNK> budget office , the top <#> % of income <UNK> pay <#> % of the taxes ."
"when you expand that to the top <#> % of income <UNK> , the percentage goes up to <UNK> !"
"so , yes , tax cuts will end up putting more money in the hands of people who are making the most money ."
"so given this , how did the bush tax cuts end up making the system more progressive ?"
"now the government <UNK> the top <#> <UNK> by $ <#> , $ <#> , $ <#> , and $ <#> as a tax cut ."
now the top <#> percent of income <UNK> will pay $ <#> - $ <#> = $ <#> .
the second <#> percent will pay $ <#> - $ <#> = $ <#> .
"yes , tax cuts can result in a more progressive tax system ."
urllink <UNK> girl is <UNK> for ' sharp tongue ' i suppose it 's just the society i live in .
"you know , that right to free speech that so many love to use and abuse ."
i guess growing up with that right makes this story so much more difficult to understand .
"the judge personally <UNK> <UNK> ’s death sentence , beyond all normal procedures and finally gained the approval of the supreme court ."
after her execution <UNK> said her punishment was not execution but he had her <UNK> for her “ sharp tongue ”
"you can say what you want about islam being a religion of peace , but it 's actions like this that give islam a bad name ."
this course is designed as a workshop for graduate students and teachers who wish to <UNK> the use of technology to the teaching of a foreign language .
"preparation of chat session arrange a date , time , duration of the sessions , inform participants and <UNK> them to confirm their attendance ."
plan the introduction of the participants at the beginning of the session ·
<UNK> of a chat session the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the session and helps participants achieve their <UNK> .
"he/she <UNK> participation , <UNK> interaction while taking into account students <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> ."
what is the appropriate language register in a chat session ?
"what 's it all about , this <UNK> thing ?"
"<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> : a term in <UNK> , <UNK> by <UNK> in various ways ( which we should really put to bed ) ."
<UNK> can also be used in contrast with hr in the sense of <UNK> being an activity .
<UNK> : an organization of which i am a member and in which i am taking on more responsibility .
<UNK> is suffering from some identity issues which should be resolved in order for the organization to move forward in a well - founded way .
"has been called "" too liberal "" , "" too conservative "" , and "" trying to be all things to all people "" ."
the last <UNK> should be better stated : <#> . define the term .
"<#> . even if it 's true and applies to us , is it really all that bad ?"
<UNK> has been called too <UNK> to recommend to <UNK> .
"perhaps a good way to put this to bed is to <UNK> the <UNK> , asking them to detail the complaints they have with the book ."
"<UNK> <UNK> : by all <UNK> accounts , a 20th - century <UNK> ."
"it seems based on <UNK> , <UNK> , etc ."
there 's fair enough reason to see <UNK> as an off - shoot of <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> of sorts .
"most <UNK> do not appear to be "" hard <UNK> "" , but influenced by <UNK> , joseph campbell , etc . and see <UNK> as <UNK> ."
"some of the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> may stem from ancient <UNK> <UNK> , though ."
<UNK> vs. <UNK> of specific traditions : <UNK> may choose bits and pieces from traditions that seem to fit well together in their eyes .
"when <UNK> are <UNK> with <UNK> , the <UNK> will tend to lean toward a more <UNK> approach to a given cultural framework ."
"language games : even under the best of circumstances ( face - to - face conversation between people sharing common language and culture ) , language games limit communication ."
most hr 's i have encountered so far seem to have a basic respect for this .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> further <UNK> the process of communicating and <UNK> effectively .
"once <#> states a position , <#> becomes open to criticism and "" <UNK> "" questioning ."
"it might be tempting to turn the tables on the <UNK> , but this is generally not a good idea ."
readers and viewers of this sort of thing can generally see the <UNK> and <UNK> of it .
"a better solution is to extend <UNK> and <UNK> to our <UNK> as much as possible , not as a strategy but to <UNK> community ."
we 're an amazingly small minority and should come together as opposed to further driving <#> another away .
"a <UNK> and <UNK> approach , founded on mutual respect and humility before the gods is the way to go ."
we need to beef up our programs such as <UNK> and publish lots of practical material for people to use in their own study and practice .
"if our <UNK> are <UNK> , we should accept the criticism ."
more on culture : we have to be honest with ourselves about some of the realities we 're dealing with .
"it is <UNK> difficult to <UNK> an ancient culture with great <UNK> , which does not <UNK> that the effort lacks merit ."
"some people rely more or less heavily on <UNK> , which is perfectly fine but presents challenges when it comes to <UNK> others of <#> 's <UNK> ."
"if you do n't present your <UNK> as founded on good research , you need to rely on something else in <UNK> , such as results of some kind ."
"not everyone is going to go for your approach , no matter which approach you <UNK> ."
"even if every single <UNK> on the planet does agree with you , we 're a <UNK> small <UNK> of the world 's population ."
so ultimately i think it 's really important to invest your <UNK> and efforts in something important to you and in which you find satisfaction .
"this can be both great and positively miserable ( maybe simultaneously , but misery has a way of making it hard to see greatness ) ."
"some of what 's miserable about it is that <#> can fail to "" see the forest for the trees "" as the old saying goes ."
"for instance , i recently read a great deal of discussion about <UNK> , which is a well - loved topic for me ."
"elaborate <UNK> were carried out , as were simple , spontaneous acts of devotion , prayer , desperation , etc ."
"but ( and seriously check this out ) , even the ancient <UNK> practiced <UNK> !"
i 'm a bit concerned about some of the <UNK> i see within <UNK> <UNK> these days .
"it 's not the <UNK> themselves which concern me , because <UNK> is good ."
"we should n't be <UNK> , but should represent the diversity present within the community ."
what does concern me is what seems like <UNK> behavior driving potential <UNK> between us all in ways that are n't necessarily healthy or helpful .
"drew campbell 's book is not beyond criticism , but it 's also far from worthless ."
"people make statements reflecting their subjective impressions , and those statements are <UNK> ( sometimes by the speaker , and sometimes by offended <UNK> ) ."
ca n't we all try to get along ?
"but so far , almost every word of content on the site has come from members of <UNK> , the organization that everyone seems to love to hate ."
does this mean that only <UNK> members are publishing things of value ?
"i 'd hesitate to go that far , but i would much rather be able to offer a definite no ."
is n't that something we can agree on enough to put all this other stuff to bed ?
do n't want to keep doing this <UNK> . ....
says here you can have an account in just <#> minutes !
"so , now it appears i 've got another blog ."
it 's not easy to describe yourself in a few <#> words .
"it 's even harder to do it in <#> , at least judging from the web <UNK> i 'm constantly encouraged to read ."
"do n't we all want someone who will share our love of <UNK> , or <UNK> , or rugby ?"
"but this is n't a personal ad , this is my blog ."
"so , it 's different , and i 'm obviously more interesting and original than the people who post all those <UNK> ."
"unlike all the other bloggers <UNK> up like mushrooms after a summer rain , i 'm a keen <UNK> of the human condition ."
i 've thought about writing for years .
"i 'm married , <UNK> , live in a nice house in the <UNK> <UNK> ."
i do <UNK> work for a technology services company .
<#> of the things i hope to put on this blog is my post - book - club reviews of the books we read .
"i also like movies , and i sometimes see really interesting movies that come to me from <UNK> ."
"i was an exchange student <#> years ago , and now i go back to france every chance i get ."
"we 're getting there , but does any of that really tell who i am ?"
"i grew up in the <UNK> church , but i 've never had particularly strong religious feelings ."
"i 'm a democrat , because there is n't really a further - left alternative that i can take seriously ."
"i was in the army reserve once , during the first gulf war , but i never went anywhere or did anything like fighting ."
"i 've got a couple of college degrees , and i do n't know if i 'll ever finish the third <#> or not ."
that 's enough of an answer to get started .
"maybe if i stick with this , i 'll discover more ."
"it 's so easy , even my kid has <#> ."
he gets like a <#> readers a day .
why do n't they cover the things i want to read about ?
"if the campaign only listened to me , i just know they 'd win ."
"maybe someday i 'll write a short story , or even a novel ."
"that 's funny , you should write it down ."
"yeah , in college , some , but not really anymore ."
"see now , that , that , that would be a good movie ."
"johnny <UNK> would play al , and maybe <UNK> davis could be <UNK> ."
"i hope you enjoy it , but mostly i hope i enjoy it ."
"the moment i arrived , he greeted me at the front <UNK> with a test paper in his hands . """
""" why are you <UNK> ? "" , "" because dad called and told me you cried last night ."
the child i gave birth to <#> years ago has not met my expectation .
"my greatest disappointment , though , is that even though he did poorly for his <UNK> , that did not <UNK> him on to study harder for his <UNK> ."
"instead , he abandoned all the homework i gave him to read "" <UNK> "" ."
"normally i would have been pleased that his is reading , but yesterday i was just sad that his is <UNK> the race ."
"a child will only do well if he wants to , many parents tell me ."
does n't <UNK> want to fulfill his dream of joining his cousin in the top school ?
i tried to think of al the moment of pride he gave me and all i remember are the <UNK> .
<UNK> and sad that he would rather make me unhappy and risk punishment for that <#> moment of weakness .
"for that shows his weakness , does n't it ?"
"i am an almost <#> <UNK> , wife to an <UNK> man , and mother to <#> <UNK> boys ."
"what a boring life you may say , make that a boring <UNK> in boring <UNK> singapore and the <UNK> gets worse ."
"imagine , a boring <UNK> in <UNK> nyc , that would n't be so bad , right ?"
even a boring <UNK> in madison <UNK> has more fun than me !
"that 's why this blog has such a naughty name , a <UNK> <#> to reflect this fun , <UNK> woman of almost <#> !"
"it had to reflect my <UNK> , that 's where <UNK> comes in , and vice ...."
i am glad mom did n't give me any other name . like
somehow <UNK> 's <UNK> vice did not have the <UNK> !
"i wanted , and being a fan of jane <UNK> 's movie , not novel , i decided on victoria 's <UNK> vice ."
my first day going out to see clients after vacation .
"it 's strange work do , going to their homes rather than they coming to mine ."
i can do without the safety and protection sitting in my own space provides .
"i prefer to ride the wave of their homes , their environment , their space ."
i was given bad directions to a school <UNK> for <#> of my clients .
"i really lost it getting there : feeling furious in the car , screaming some , feeling totally lost <UNK> and emotionally ."
"i 'm sure a strong part of my just wanted to be on the "" let 's play "" of <UNK> and <UNK> going back to work ."
"it ended up being a pretty good meeting , resulting in the kid staying in the school , and i pulled it together , thank goodness ."
but i really had to work hard to be <UNK> .
"traveling the <#> miles to the school , i thought how in the world do people do it , a regular daily commute ."
i heard a story on npr this morning about people living in pennsylvania <UNK> <#> hours to new york city to work .
but the story was about how they had to make changes in their lives because of high gas prices . yet
"every <#> of these idiots , as described in the article , was driving an suv ."
"why on earth do you need an suv to drive , alone , from pa to nyc ?"
it 's the stupidest thing in the world .
we <UNK> were supposed to feel <UNK> for them ; i felt nothing but disgust !
this is my gift to myself after returning from a <#> - week vacation : starting a blog .
today was an intense day that i managed by keeping my list of things to do low .
"i completed those tasks pretty darn well , to my satisfaction , but i was exhausted and stressed , still , at the end of the day ."
"as i thought about it later , i realized what was missing was any creative act ."
"then again , i could have taken time at lunch to practice my <UNK> ( a <UNK> ) , the piano , or the drums ."
i wonder if i 'm going to be <UNK> myself .
"the olympics is on in the background , and i 'm sick of the star <UNK> banner ."
the big girl made me furious tonight -- she came in for dinner from playing expecting us to have her friends and their parents over for dinner tonight .
"then she through a huge <UNK> , complete with extreme crying ."
"yup , even a "" <UNK> expert "" like me loses it ."
"but i did keep it together and help the <UNK> through it , <UNK> her while she cried , though i 'd have preferred to <UNK> her neck ."
"still , i 've been <UNK> my feelings around all evening , especially after a second break - down by her just before bed ."
"i hope you find it the same , if not interesting ."
today was an <UNK> day to say the least .
sometimes i wonder way the hell things are the way they are .
"i try to be a nice person but when you are nice , people will run the hell all over you ."
today i had to turn in my best friend for getting a traffic ticket and giving the officer my name instead of hers .
.... .... with friends like that i 'm set for life <UNK>
well i bet she wo nt do it again .
i guess i can cross her name off my christmas list .
on another note my son had a good day in school today .
i was so worried when he started school but i think that he will do fine .
"as for my love life , that s not doing fine at all ."
"i am <UNK> in someone but i just do n't think he sees it , or me for that matter ."
i 've done everything possible to get him to notice me .
do n't get me wrong we talk quite often but there is always people around .
this is my first post so bear with me .
"i want to start by saying that i love life , i just think that sometimes people are <UNK> a messed up hand ."
why ca n't some of us have some happiness sometime .
i have a wonderful son that i thank god for everyday .
he is truely the light of my life .
"when i found out that i was pregnant i worried "" what am i going to do with a kid ? """
", now i wonder what i ever done without him ."
if somthing ever happened to my son i would die .
with that said i want to know why am i so sad ?
( i only got married because i was pregnant and thought it was the right thing to do .
i wonder if i ever will fall in love .
"i just hate the weeks that my son is at his dads <UNK> those weeks are very hard to get through , not that anyone cares anyway ."
bars are the best and worst places in the world .
i just returned from having lunch in a local <UNK> bar .
it was really to bad everyone was talking out there ass .
"so , anyway , i pretty much ca n't remember all of the clever , intellectual <UNK> flying about the room , but i will tell you this much ."
"speaking of which , have you every met anybody that spoke like charlie parker played <UNK> in the early days ."
i do believe i have successfully done that in this post .
so i will leave you with this last thought .
"my pants are on fire , the <UNK> is blank , and all the little birds that have never seen <UNK> now are driving to vegas for the weekend !"
this may possibly the most interesting reading anyone falls upon on the net or quite the opposite .
so today is the kind of day where i 'm really tempted to have a <UNK> .
"people yelling at me for things they do n't even understand , people being mean , and on top of it all a gloomy day ."
but it 's not worth it to have a <UNK> .
perhaps the best thing is to sit down with a fine whine and some aged <UNK> .
"> > hi tim , > > i envy your life on the road ."
"i always > hate coming home from "" away "" ."
i do n't care if it 's business or > pleasure .
that 's why i 'm starting to think that travel photography might just be > the thing for me .
"i had n't thought of photography seriously until i > realized , early this summer , just how much of it i 'm actually doing ."
"i > love doing it , it 's such a natural thing for me to pick up my camera , >"
and i 'm realizing that i have a good eye for composition .

"writing is , > too , but it comes from inside and you do it alone ."
"photography > requires that you interact with the environment , which you can do > "" alone "" but you 're always looking outside yourself ."
i think i get more > energy from that .
"it 's much more <UNK> , and it keeps me from > <UNK> and <UNK> into insanity ."
"well , i drove over <#> miles last week ."
"i did n't know i could do it , > but it was incredibly easy !"

"i dreaded coming home , as usual , but it turned out it was n't so bad ."
"i > always forget how pretty the "" green "" of a wisconsin summer is ."

"<#> miles is something > you average in about <#> days , huh ?"
"well , i hope you have a good time > and do well on your tour ."
"welcome to my space to <UNK> , process and <UNK> what 's around and inside me ."
"it is our wish to ensure that it meets your expectations . """
"yes , this came from a <UNK> , and yes , it is regarding my husband 's <UNK> ."
just looking at this letter makes my hands shake .
i think i 'll go sort my <UNK> now .
"that 's somewhat <UNK> , and even <UNK> , when you can <UNK> glass and whatnot ."
i started listening to johnny <UNK> & the <UNK> live at max 's kansas city in <#> .
"i was halfway through "" milk me "" when i realized that i would n't be falling asleep anytime soon ."
"eventually i 'm going to write a big , rambling expose on a lot of the great <UNK> - punk bands from cleveland in the early and <UNK> ."
"of particular interest : rocket from the <UNK> , electric <UNK> , the mirrors and the <UNK> ."
"he was a fucking amazing <UNK> , but like many talented people , he could n't really keep it together ."
ai n't it fun when she <UNK> you and leaves you on the run .
"well , ai n't it fun when you broken up every band that you ever begun ."
ai n't it fun when you know that you 're gonna die young .
""" i see that guns ' n roses covered this amazing song , and i would imagine that their version sucks beyond belief ."
"so , peter <UNK> died young , <UNK> <UNK> died young , and fucking <UNK> rose is still alive and kicking ."
"i plan to also <UNK> into my fascination with <UNK> cinema , particularly <UNK> lang , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"but that , my friends , will have to wait for another lonely <UNK> night ."
i 'm not the <UNK> person in the world when it comes to this computer stuff .
i will use this platform mostly to share my tastes in obscure music and movies and left - wing politics with the world .
"it is now late , too late for me to be up any longer , so perhaps i will write more tomorrow ."
"ok , this is my first posting ever , but thought that <UNK> might be good therapy ."
i recently completed a year long divorce process that was very <UNK> and also <UNK> heart - breaking .
", she decided to do this after we had an incredible son who is now <#> years old ."
"i use to be very <UNK> , outgoing , excited and wanted to live life to the fullest ."
"now , i want to sit home , watch tv and do nothing -- how pathetic is that ! ! ! ! ?"
"i used to ride my bike <#> - <#> miles a week , and i have n't been on my bike in <UNK> <#> months ! !"
"now , we are just trying to survive ."
"on top of all of this , i am trying to care for our son ."
"<UNK> is my <UNK> ( for anyone that sees this but does n't know me ) , and he is a spoiled <#> at that ."
this how we have found him when we came home on several occasions .
"you ca n't see it in the picture , but there was a <UNK> on the <UNK> and his daddy was <UNK> <UNK> for us ... including him ."
"i wonder what he does that we do n't see ... maybe i do n't want to know , eh ?"
"anyway , he does weigh at least <#> lbs here ."
"he still thinks he 's small enough to be a lap dog , and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it ."
"of course , at that point i am <UNK> and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair ."
"but he has more kisses than i can stand sometimes , and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit ."
"well , i took <UNK> to get <UNK> this morning ."
"poor thing , he was so excited it makes me think he has no idea what is to come ."
"he was like a wild thing this morning , playing and running around this morning ."
he really loves to watch the cars and truck moving .
"then we got there , and i had to take him over to the side to go <UNK> before we went into the office ."
"i could hardly contain him and in fact , he got loose of his collar and scared a poor little <UNK> - <UNK> ."
they called someone from the back to come get him once i put the collar back on and i <UNK> to the little dog that was just shaking .
he 'll be like a whole new dog !
here 's a little pic of him when he was a baby
"he 's only about <UNK> there , but he weighed <UNK> last time he went to the vet ."
he 's <#> months old now and so handsome !
<UNK> 's <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> ) is a <UNK> <UNK> disorder which causes <UNK> <UNK> or very severe visual <UNK> .
"the genes causing <UNK> are many , each involving different <UNK> processes , but all concerning the <UNK> 's <UNK> , or the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
vision in <UNK> <UNK> from total <UNK> to low vision .
it is generally diagnosed in the first few months of life .
"currently <#> genes responsible for <UNK> have been identified , and researchers think at least as many are there to be discovered ."
"<UNK> is the most severe form of <UNK> <UNK> , yet recent studies have demonstrated that it may be <#> of those conditions <UNK> for treatment ."
this proved that gene therapy does work for at least <#> form of <UNK> .
<UNK> trials on humans carrying the <UNK> <UNK> are planned for as early as <#> .
if gene therapy proves successful it is very likely that it can be extended to patients carrying different <UNK> <UNK> .
"researchers now have to find ways to improve <UNK> , which will allow the brain to receive clear information from the <UNK> ."
"this is challenging , but very <UNK> , as such a procedure has the potential to restore vision to a blind eye affected by most <UNK> diseases ."
"each lab is using a different technique : some <UNK> work with solar energy , others require batteries and a camera linked to a pair of glasses ."
"some are <UNK> on top of the <UNK> , others under the outer layer ."
"i am a <#> year - old patient with <UNK> , and i constantly keep myself up - to - date with research , <UNK> waiting for <UNK> ."

its my second favorite kind of day in l.a .
"yeah , that has n't happened in a long <UNK> time ...."
"anyway , my husband adam sent me this blogging info and i decided to set this up ."
i know that we live in a media obsessed culture .
"the <UNK> , <UNK> nature of the artist seems inherent , rarely finding a place to rest for too terribly long ."
perhaps i will put some effort into collecting the names of casting people who live the love ...
"i work with an actor who is a veteran of television shows and films , her career has <UNK> and crashed and is now in mid <UNK> again ."
we rarely have a session where she does nt cry about something or another ... is she self <UNK> ?
i often times challenge actors as to why they would take classes with me when they so rarely <UNK> as to my perception of good acting ...
i am only as good a teacher as i am a student ... so lets get into it !
why is it that we are such a divided nation when it comes to politics ?
could it be that there really are <#> <UNK> ?
how do i know that this is the way it is ?
because i am a have <UNK> my claim ; picked my side .
i am a republican . to about half of you
", that is <UNK> , to the other half it means we are brothers ( or sisters , as the case may be ) ."
for starters my father owned his own small business most of his life and as such was a republican .
"of course , i eventually suspended to the government education i was receiving and began to pay more attention to organizations like green peace ."
"again , some of you who are reading this think i have it all wrong ."
"it makes me ask myself , "" how can anyone not look at the facts and conclude anything else ?"
<#> theory would be that you were raised to believe that the <UNK> created jobs .
i was <UNK> believe my dad ( and eventually other small business ) created jobs .
"where as i learned that in spite of whether which way the economy was headed , i would always be alright if i worked hard <UNK> a little ."
maybe you grew up getting a government check that you <UNK> on and that taught you that money <UNK> from the government .
"of course , after my dad died when i was <#> , we recieve a <#> government checks from the government until i graduated high school ."
you see liberal democrats believe that by <UNK> benefits to people without them having to work for it helps people .
i believe that this <UNK> people from being all they can be .
it holds them back and sets low expectations .
"from my perspective , i have been a liberal and could sense it was wrong then and know it is wrong now ."
i have grown into a conservative republican by getting knocked down and getting back up largely without the help of the government .
"lately , ( i.e. , since <#> ) i have become much more <UNK> in my political beliefs ."
everything he had done since <#> has been no less than incredible .
i guess i 'd like to hear from some of you <UNK> .
have you ever looked at facts ( not feelings - facts ) ?
"you might be asking yourself , then again you might not , what kind of classes does biology major take ? this semester i’m taking <#> classes ."
"oh , i’m not as crazy as you think <#> of the <#> are labs and <#> is a <#> credit course designed to …"
"well , i’m not quite sure what it ’s designed to do because i haven’t been yet ."
"statistics – ( <#> credits ) yes , math is important for biology <UNK> ."
"i already have algebra , the college version , under my belt and calculus scares the crap out of me so this semester , it ’s statistics ."
( something is definitely wrong when you see a statistics class as the lesser of <#> evils . )
general chemistry <UNK> - ( <#> credits – that means <#> days a week ! ! !
"<UNK> , <UNK> ! ) here ’s some food for thought ."
at many universities you can not get major in biology without getting a minor in chemistry .
<#> year of gen chem <#> year of organic chem .
i already have my first semester of gen chem under my belt .
"if you’re ever looking for a creative way to commit suicide , take gen chem i over a <#> - week summer session ."
"fact is , by week <#> , i wanted to die ."
it ’s over now and i’m looking at gen chem ii with new perspective .
no way do i want to pay for it twice !
<UNK> – ( <#> credits ) what ’s a bio major without some biology classes ?
this is the class where we have to memorize the <UNK> of every animal on the planet .
"we don’t have to memorize classes for <UNK> but everything else , yea ."
do you realize that an overwhelming majority of the animals on this planet don’t have a spine ?
reminds me of a lot of people i know …
an interesting twist to this story is that i already had a year of “ biology for <UNK> .
"well , i get the credits for it but it doesn’t count towards my program ."
"so when i graduate , i’ll have a lot of extra “"
<UNK> ” i’ll be set and ready to take the stuff i really want to take .
<UNK> lab – ( <#> credits ) i’m excited about this <#> .
” this is the class i haven’t been to yet .
"now , don’t get your panties in a bunch , i’m not skipping classes ."
i’m thinking the university did this on purpose so that i wouldn’t have a <#> day week .
no ! i’m there <#> days a week because of <#> <UNK> <#> - credit class . whatever .
"say it a few times fast blog , blog , blog ."
what 's that all about anyway ? this is my <UNK> new blog .
i 've tried online <UNK> before but it never really worked well .
i 'll give this blog thing a go and see if it works any better .
i created this blog because i thought it might be fun to outline some of my experiences .
"you see , i 'm going to be <#> soon and i 'm a college student ."
i 'm working towards an <UNK> degree in biology .
"i 'm single , i have a dog and i have a few off the wall hobbies ."
"so here i am on the second day of the first semester of my "" junior "" year ."
"i put junior in quotes because , well , i 'm not sure how they figure that ."
so most of my core classes are taken care of .
"it 's all math and science from here on out and it might take me another <#> years to finish , but i 'm determined to finish ."
seems like i 've managed to develop <UNK> at the grand old age of <#> .
i failed a lung function test quite <UNK> yesterday and now have an <UNK> and an appointment to see the doctor in <#> weeks .
so it 's probably not worth anyone <UNK> of over the next couple of weeks .
and we are setting of for hols in <UNK> very soon !
just going to test it works and them will post the link .
u read my blog and has <UNK> me on the information i posted about <UNK> powell 's former band ....
i 'll try and get my facts right in future !
"they dropped the <UNK> article after their debut single ( building , <UNK> disco feb ' <#> ) ."
so unbelievable truth were a late 90s band .
u had his own un official website - <UNK> did the official <#> ! and
u only saw them <#> times between 1st april <#> ( <UNK> ) and sept 16th september <#> ( oxford ) ... ! ! !
what should have been a good night out in <UNK> turned into a bit of a disappointment because people have no damn respect .
there were <#> acts on at the pub we went to .
shame their music did n't really do it justice .
i think the lyrics were meant to be amusing but i could only catch the odd word here and there .
"so the music was n't to our taste , but we respected the musicians , kept quiet while they performed and <UNK> politely ."
"then came u 's friend , <UNK> , of the urllink sad song co ."
"unfortunately , not everyone left - because those that did stay talked and <UNK> and laughed and generally drowned out poor <UNK> and his bass player ( jason ) ."
"you could see he was getting really pissed off by now , and he said something along the lines of "" ah well"
"not a happy <UNK> , and <UNK> so ."
"anyway , we came away feeling fairly <UNK> off with it all ."
"well done <UNK> for doing your best under very difficult circumstances , and thank you very bloody much you idiots who ruined the evening ."
"anyway , u bought the sad song co cd so at least we 'll be able to hear what he 's like in peace and quiet ."
the <UNK> - old 's decision came amidst reports of a transfer <UNK> by big - spending <UNK> side chelsea .
"<UNK> 's agent marc roger <UNK> presented madrid with a £ <UNK> offer for the <UNK> from the blues on wednesday morning . """
<UNK> so now we 're after another player ... and
"it was a good season , a season all chelsea supporters could be proud of , and <#> that showed we could be optimistic about times to come ."
and then roman bloody <UNK> whatever the hell his name is came along
now every season you have to buy a couple of players .
"and with <UNK> gone back to italy ( sad but predictable ) and <UNK> retired , we did need to make a couple of <UNK> to fill the <UNK> ."
"but <UNK> is just flashing the cash , as far as i am concerned ."
"it seems like he 's got the money and he wants everyone to know it , so he 's buying every available player just to make the point ."
yet there does n't seem to be a great deal of thought going in to who he actually signs .
"we 've ended up with about <#> new <UNK> , plus the <#> or so that we already had ."
"do we stick cole ( a good signing , i grant you ) and <UNK> in the middle because they know each other so well already ?"
they are all top quality international players - none of them are going to be happy sitting on the bench or playing for the <UNK> at <UNK> .
at the same time we 're <UNK> solely on the fantastic <UNK> ( best keeper in the league ) to hold the fort in goal ...
"<#> new <UNK> bought , but <#> is out injured for the whole season and the other is , by all accounts , even worse than <UNK> ."
"as far as i 'm concerned , any <UNK> we do achieve are going to have been bought rather than earned , and that bothers me ."
i 'd be far happier if we 'd bought a player here and there and then built on the sound <UNK> we developed last season ...
success this year is going to have a hollow ring to it for me .
i wo n't go so far as to say i 'd like to see chelsea fail
"last night we went to <UNK> <UNK> to see urllink snow patrol , who really rocked ."
"a friend of u 's had got the tickets and is a big fan , but up till then i 'd never heard of them ."
lo - fi ' [ according to urllink this drowned in sound article ] .
"i predict that a ) chelsea girl will like them , and b ) i will be disappointed because my expectations are too high . """
"and i did , and he was n't ."
but i quickly <UNK> to them and was <UNK> along by the end .
their new ( third ) album the final straw is out now and there are some samples on their website … definitely <#> to watch .
they were supported by urllink <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> - both not bad but nothing to get excited about .
tonight we are off to <UNK> to see urllink the sad song company .
"i 've no idea what his solo stuff is like , but apparently the songs reflect the name of the project and are rather sad ."
"we 're staying at my place tonight so i can top up the cat 's food and water , and hopefully find her alive and well ."
i really do n't want to go home to find a <UNK> <UNK> !
but then i realised which site this story was on ...
"urllink john mark <UNK> - <UNK> churches , <UNK> , leaders and their <UNK> ..."
is this kind of thing recommended to <UNK> to use in their <UNK> ?
"in fact , i only got free after <#> days because a dog started licking my private parts and an old woman complained to the police . """
"still working on the site ... you 'll be able to leave comments soon , hopefully <UNK> )"
<UNK> of the week in our house is urllink <UNK> .
basically it 's a way of sharing your books with others and tracking where they go .
"you read a book , register and review it on the site and get a special id number and url for it ."
so the answer is to buy cheap <UNK> in the charity shops and use them ! then you 're helping others in <#> ways .
"i left my first book in <UNK> park , <UNK> this week and have a couple more to release next week ..."
"it gave me a bit of a buzz , sad but true !"
"anyway , fingers crossed i 'll get lucky and someone will give my books a good home !"
<UNK> to various technical <UNK> i 've managed to screw up my old blog urllink blue is the colour .
i ca n't wait till i get <UNK> in the station car park now <UNK> )
"turns out she and her "" silly "" boyfriend ( her words , not mine ! ) got married recently ..."
thanks to <UNK> for <UNK> me to a rare bbc website <UNK> .
"urllink the <UNK> times : "" the place for all the <UNK> family news ."
"if you 've got something to say , an announcement to make , a link to post or just want a moan , do it here !"
any family member can post on this blog ... my latest project . at a family gathering at the weekend
""" ooh , what a good idea , are you offering to set it up ?"
"well , it got me out of doing any house work on sunday !"
roll on monday when they are back at school .
"sitting in starbucks in the retail outlet in <UNK> , having had a row in <UNK> about which shoes my son will permit himself to year for school ."
"i have shopping , how on earth people become <UNK> i 'll never know , my head hurts ."
looks like <UNK> powell felt pretty much the same about his gig in <UNK> as u and i did .. but in more <UNK> terms !
urllink the sad song co. it really bugs me when people have no respect for others ...
just have to hope i never attend a gig like this again .
some <UNK> <UNK> coming up in the next couple of months ...
"elbow in <UNK> at the end of september , <UNK> in october and iron <UNK> ( yes , you did read that correctly ! ) in december !"
there seem to be a fair few of us around ...
urllink google search : chelsea girl ... but i 'm at the top !
most of the last few weeks have been taken up with recording and editing material for a college assignment - a <#> minute documentary on urllink <UNK> .
"well , it 's almost finished , and a member of the urllink uk yahoo <UNK> group has very kindly put it online for me ."
it 's quite a big download - <UNK> or <UNK> depending on which quality you choose - but i 'd love to hear what you think of it !
"oh , btw , if you decide to join as a result of listening , can you stick <UNK> or hey - <UNK> down as your <UNK> !"
guess what everyone will be getting for xmas this year ....
"ah , come on , i 'm a poverty <UNK> student !"
the <UNK> <UNK> is limited to just a small area of the conflict .
"on september <#> , <#> tony blair stated : ' his ( saddam 's )"
"tony blair described the intelligence upon which his <UNK> was based as : ' extensive , detailed and <UNK> ' ."
the <UNK> which he was quoting from went on to say : ' some of these weapons are <UNK> within <#> minutes of an order to use them ' .
the whole war was fought on the basis that iraq posed an immediate threat .
we were told when war started that iraq had <UNK> chemical and biological weapons to use against british and us forces .
"to date , no weapons of mass destruction have been found ."
"sign the <UNK> to tony blair now at urllink our world , our say and get all your friends and colleagues to do the same ."
this is part of a major new our world our say campaign to ensure that politicians are made <UNK> to us for their actions .
"make sure you try this ... type "" miserable failure "" ( without the quotes ) into google and hit the "" i 'm feeling lucky "" button ...."
"if you 're ever tempted to go and see a band called i , <UNK> , do n't bother !"
"best band in the world at the moment , <UNK> ."
i suppose you could say i 'm just slightly snow patrol - obsessed !
"anyway , check out the band at the urllink snow patrol official website , buy the album and <UNK> what 's so good about them for yourselves ."
"apologies for the absence , i 've been far too busy being obsessed with weddings !"
i 've finally managed to get the blogger tool to work in opera ( my usual browser ) so expect much more regular updates from now on !
urllink this site is well worth a visit .
it 's by a russian woman who is a <UNK> .
<UNK> and i went to paris at the weekend .
"hah , no <UNK> - standard wedding band for us , oh no ! ! !"
"but we are already making plans for our wedding , and will be putting all the info in a website that <UNK> is putting together ..."
there 's nothing on there yet but keep checking urllink <UNK> for all our plans !
never again will i moan about being <UNK> ... the urllink global rich list is <UNK> stuff .
i wish i 'd thought of doing this ... could have made a fortune the amount of mud on me !
urllink ebay item <#> ( ends <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ) - genuine <UNK> <#> mud !
"i do n't know why , but urllink "" the infinite cat project - cats watching cats watching cats "" makes me think of alice in <UNK> ."
"sometimes i 'm a bit weird , i know ."
now all i have to do is find a way to get <UNK> to pose for the camera ...
"could anyone <UNK> and provide a few new ones , please ?"
"update i 've added links to other <UNK> , my <UNK> , and some job - related websites ."
this is the initial post for this weblog .
"i am <UNK> <UNK> in order to make it a more <UNK> effort , very similar to urllink the end of free ."
"<UNK> , i maintain a few or more urllink other blogs ."
"i know that may sound like a lot , but since this weblog is a <UNK> effort , i wo n't need to spend much time on this ..."
your local public library is a great place to do research .
<UNK> <#> such public library sites : urllink the public library of <UNK> and hamilton county urllink <UNK> and <UNK> county public library
"<UNK> files : make your <UNK> , letters of <UNK> , references , portfolio , <UNK> and more available online !"
"you can have your <UNK> files maintained and <UNK> <UNK> , using a professional <UNK> processing service ."
there are a number of fee - based services available .
"with <#> such service , urllink reference now , you can send your entire file , including <UNK> letters of <UNK> ."
"in addition , it contains information for <UNK> who may want to find out about <UNK> , <UNK> the <UNK> 's resume database , and so on ."
"from urllink <UNK> : "" if you hate your job , either change your job or change your attitude about the job ."
"<#> or the other . "" -- john - roger"
"urllink from msn careers : <UNK> up a potential employer "" you finally found the right job ."
or so you thought . now that you have been on the scene for <#> weeks
your boss consistently calls meetings during lunchtime -- sans food .
"yesterday , you received a proposal at <UNK> p.m. to type up by 9:00 a.m. the following day ."
"and although the company is <UNK> with people burning the midnight oil , there is little <UNK> interaction among employees . """
"you may feel desperate for a job , but why would you want to work for just a paycheck ?"
i am back to work today and busy cleaning up crap from the weeks before .
this usually takes a great deal of time out of the day until i get to a point where i can begin work on my actual projects .
"currently <#> e - learning projects are on the board , as well as other <UNK> <UNK> related duties and reports ."
i need to focus ! ! ! ! ! !
my website provides me with a sharing space for friends and family .
as well it allows me to try out various web technologies that i may not currently be able to do at work .
you can check it out at urllink <UNK> <UNK> my main site links to other things .
to use space that i would n't fill on their server .
"i mean let 's face it , i can link to the space provided by my <UNK> if i want to display graphics or video ."
"and since i 'm already spending over <#> a month for th <UNK> of using the internet , i may as well do my blogging for zip ."
i did n't see any real advantage to using theirs over blogger .
"maybe i 'm blind to it , but even blogger pro ( for me ) serves no real advantage ."
i think this is when i leave <#> career and look to starting another .
"i 'm experiencing lots of <UNK> regarding leaving something familiar and walking a different walk , but i have to do it ."
my head is just not in the game where i 'm working now .
and if i remained there i 'd likely be moving to a position where that could have a negative effect on everyone around me .
"so , time to let my life <UNK> before me as the gods ( god ) intended ."
"<#> brothers , <#> sisters , mother , father , uncles , and of course my dad ."
just in the last <#> weeks his <#> sisters died .
gives <#> a wierd feeling knowing that there is an end to this life .
"as the scottish <UNK> goes , "" better enjoy this life while you can , for you 're a long time dead . """
so i <UNK> to peer pressure from my friend <UNK> and went and played <#> holes of golf last week .
first time in <#> years i 'd done this .
and as i <UNK> my way around the course i remembered why i stopped playing .
i suck at golf ... and it is n't a game that i want to spend a lot of time at to get good ...
"it 's a lots like <UNK> , only with clubs ."
but you do get the satisfaction of hitting something and the walk was nice .
"even if i work out ... run , lift weights and stuff ."
slowly but surely i 'm finishing off the e - learning projects at work .
my goal is to get them done before i retire next year .
getting them done <UNK> more than just getting them working .
"as long as we do it in an intelligent and meaningful manner , involving all of our <UNK> along the way ."
i signed up for the online version of the book of the month club at urllink <UNK> .
so far it has proven to be really good .
<UNK> a little on the expensive side at $ <#> u.s .
per month ( <#> <UNK> ) for <#> books .
that i see it in print it 's a lot ! ! !
ah well maybe i can learn something along the way in their urllink self help sections . and be entertained in their urllink fiction section .
for <UNK> all that cash i even got a nifty little urllink <UNK> player from them .
i 'm well into the first class of many to come at <UNK> college of art .
lots of work and major pain in the right brain .
hopefully it means i 'm stretching myself and allowing some abstract thinking and creativity in .
strange to feel this way about something i dedicated the last <#> years of my life to .
"i know it 's right to leave , because i can not talk about some areas of my present workplace without feeling anger and rage ."
"i go somewhere else and channel that into something creative , rather than destroy myself by being where i am ."
"i 'm starting to <UNK> myself now , so i 'd better go work out and channel the feeling ."
"seemed to be well <UNK> by city council members , and was almost a <UNK> sweep in passing it as <UNK> by our police commission ."
plus there will be some development capital in the kitty for e - learning development for the service .
it 's the beginning of <#> and the pressure is on .
"several projects are due to be wrapped up , or some <UNK> of wrapping it for the <UNK> before i wrap it up with the <UNK> ."
i want to get my butt into the fall sessions at <UNK> .
", so i have to get a portfolio of recent work together , along with umm .... an essay of what is up with ... me ."
"i 'm <#> years old , and most of the time i really do n't know what is up with me ."
"i seem to move from <#> thing to another in an effort to , <UNK> get it right ?"
i 'm drawing up a storm in my saturday class .
"man oh man i did n't think that <UNK> drawing was this much work , but <UNK> again ."
"takes a great deal of work to capture an image , a feeling , a shape or a moment ."
good instructor and lots of interesting people in the class .
lots of interesting works developing both good and not so good in the students .
i 'm turning <#> this <UNK> ( february <#> ) and still on the retirement trail .
"i 'm going to be making significantly less , but i think physically and mentally i ca n't continue working in my current environment ."
"i 'm starting to feel the lack of direction , decision and support more and more ."
i 'm also feeling cut out of the overall decision making process for the direction of e - learning .
"i do n't think i 'm imagining it , ' cause other people have also noted we suffer a surreal chasing our own <UNK> kinda business model ."
"<UNK> paper is in , the plans have been explained , and ... still no clear decisions ."
there is still hope for the <UNK> to move forward .
", i could just <UNK> or go stir the nest with a stick ."
i hope we do n't <UNK> some more <UNK> based companies through lack of decision and vision .
i'm ... feeling like i 'm in some bad <UNK> .
people do n't really act like this in reality do they ?
"lot 's of ratings done on products by them and consumers , so it 's an interesting page to point to ."
and i 've finished a <UNK> <#> month spring session taking <#> courses .
"<#> or <#> maybe , but <#> was pretty much <UNK> ."
i think i did pretty well though . need to get some cash together now though . going to be a tight year .
"i seem to be stuck in some sort of late night loop , where i stay up late and sleep in late ( <UNK> - 11:00 a.m. ) <UNK> ."
"it 's way too <UNK> of shift work , which got me into a wierd sleep pattern to begin with ."
i registered for my courses for this coming year .
"somewhat disappointing since i have completed <#> semester already , but can not move ahead until the year does ."
the courses seem to be set up to <UNK> to someone coming in starting at <#> .
"for example , i had wanted to take the second art history class necessary for foundation year ."
i ca n't because it 's not scheduled until the winter session .
does n't seem to be any advantage to work ahead .
last couple of weeks has been extremely hot here . all in the <#> 's .
during this time i met with a fellow i had known in my years with the calgary police service and he had an exit interview of sorts with me .
he 's currently back on contract with them in the <UNK> .
we compared notes on similar experiences and found many .
"he also told me that these same experiences are consistent with all of the other interviews he had conducted with <UNK> members , and those who had quit ."
i guess this would be an opportunity to fix those issues if the <UNK> chose to .
they have to keep the <UNK> system alive and preserve the status <UNK> .
"if they start making positive changes , then there will be lots of traditional police positions that would need to be filled by properly qualified civilians ."
"ca n't have that , where would they put officers that have screwed up or are going through negative psychological problems ."
"i mean , that s what we have human resources and training for is n't it ? or the front counter of district offices ."
i figure that in ten years from now if i can speak of the <UNK> without getting angry then i will have finally moved on .
"dizzy , my head feels heavy and i 'm tired ."
"exercise is what i need , but i did that ."
i could go out and get a job and work part time .
i do n't just want to work to fill a <UNK> income void .
maybe i should though ' cause the matrix has me and i 'm making payments on my visa again .
i 'm really happy this organization will finally embrace technology that has been readily available to the average <#> year old for some time now ?
the ability to move technology ahead in that organization is always left up to the master <UNK> .
i 'm the people that needed to get going on projects that had been <UNK> <UNK> for <#> years .
this is a site of definite urllink masters of flash technology .
great design and <UNK> <UNK> evident in their portfolio as well .
"wow , i am in my second semester at <UNK> and only have to complete <#> courses to finish off my first year ."
i 'm struggling a bit ( motivation wise ) this semester .
"probably slipping into a bit of a funk , but hey , i learned that during the <UNK> , artists were considered to be of a <UNK> <UNK> ."
it 's a depressing negative space to be in .
i completed a website for a friend of mine who is doing <UNK> work in <UNK> .
"check it out , it 's called urllink <UNK> ."
urllink <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> western australia went with my sophie and <UNK> 's class to the <UNK> yesterday .
"it was a good trip , even for <#> year olds ."
apparently the best bit was seeing and touching a iron <UNK> <UNK> .
"for my money the best bit was the tour of the old <UNK> , the way it all worked and what not , it was great ."
"last night was also <UNK> 's last advanced class , <UNK> and i got her a copy of "" sophie 's world "" to read on her trip"
", i hope she has fun over in the uk ."

i 'm not saying they did n't deserve them but it does make <#> a bit suspicious ;-)
"and it only cost me my <UNK> recipe , and a post card ."
of course it 's cool and all but when it comes down to it it just another email account and i still have my <UNK> addresses .
still i can access it from work and i can use it as a <UNK> address so personal stuff does n't come here .
"it still is a bit of <UNK> my territory , making sure i own "" <UNK> "" all over the place . :-)"
urllink are you living in a computer <UNK> ?
"ok it 's not news but i 've been <UNK> my philosophical interests , and then i started to read some greg <UNK> short stories ."
i guess that lent some of the angst i had in my last post .
in the wizard classes i sometimes feel like i 'm promoting an anti - <UNK> agenda .
still without that stuff the rest is still worthwhile .
well i 've let this blog founder for a year or more and i think i 'll get it going again .
i guess things have been rushed a bit of late .
"work , <UNK> on <UNK> nights , teaching wizard school tuesday <UNK> , gym in the morning , trying to feel useful helping set up the <UNK> web site ."
and i still have n't had much time to work on <UNK> .
yet again <UNK> what needs to be done by keeping busy .
i 'm going to miss it i 'm just looking forward to having the time off .
my main concern is that i 'll loose touch with the group of <UNK> i 've <UNK> a part of .
at least i 'll still have the kids in <UNK> .
"i 'm realy enjoying working with the kids , seeing how they are learning and <UNK> ."

"picky point though , it 's a <UNK> <UNK> , only <#> leg ."
ever read just the right thing on just the right day .
this article reminds me of some of the reasons i 've been in this industry for <UNK> ! ! !
"i started in july <#> , or there <UNK> ."
it provides me with a good wage ( only a <#> % increase this year though )
so i can have <#> kids in private school and a nice house ( nothing left over though )
i think i need to get back to some fun programming .
i think a couple of web sites and a game or <UNK> for the pocket pc .
urllink i 'm just here for the food : food + heat = cooking - <UNK> books i ca n't believe i have n't written any food posts .

hey i 'm anti <UNK> at the best of times but this looks nasty .
"yesterday was a generally depressing , weird day i was very <UNK> to hear about george <UNK> <UNK> 's death ."
"while i had n't been in touch in a while , we 'd hung out some at conventions over the years ."
"it was sunny , humid and in the ' 70s in the morning and early afternoon ."
it turned very windy and we spent the afternoon having tornado watches .
"despite that , in our part of pittsburgh , there was little lightning or rain , and the wind probably only <UNK> to about <#> mph ."
"we spent an enjoyable <#> days ... ... up in boston and a cold , rainy day down in <UNK> ."
jim and i help to run science fiction conventions .
"last year , we managed the urllink program division for the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"so now that we 're starting to emerge from the burn - out from last year 's <UNK> , we 're starting to work on the <#> <UNK> ."
we really do n't know what we 'll be doing for the next <UNK> .
"while we lived in massachusetts from <#> - <#> , we only spend about a week a year up there now as we 're settled in pittsburgh ."
"boston is really <UNK> , despite the high tech bust ."
i saw at least <#> different <UNK> in the back bay last saturday night .
we visited friends and family and had some terrific meals .
"april <#> : my first "" official "" weblog i went to a political event tonight , "" in honor "" of tax day ."
"it was supposed to be something of an <UNK> 's <UNK> on how our taxes , especially our state taxes , are being spent ."
"that was fine , but some of the "" entertainment "" was on the clueless side ."
<#> group decided that doing a <#> minute rant on palestinians as victims was an appropriate way to <UNK> us about environmental affairs .
"instead of <UNK> or <UNK> at the end , i said , "" that was really poor judgement on your parts . """
there 's plenty of blame to go around in the middle east .
"ironically , i heard a brief ray of hope for <UNK> - palestinian relations just this morning ."
"jewish , <UNK> and christian employees work side by side ."
at least there 's <#> place where people seem to be able to talk and work together .
"i 'm still not sure "" why blog "" when i 've been writing web pages since <#> ."
"but , i thought i 'd give it a shot ."
"yes , i know he was <#> , so i should n't have been taken <UNK> by much ."
"still , there are always those people whom you 've only met occasionally that you hope to see more of in the future , despite their age ."
i felt that way very strongly about <UNK> .
"actually , they were mostly done in february -- i like to send in returns for <UNK> early and hold the returns that need payment in mid - april ."
i do wish that that post office would n't be open extra hours on april <#> .
"on living in a "" safe "" <UNK> we live on a busy street in a nice <UNK> of pittsburgh ."
"we moved here in <#> because we were looking for an area with an excellent school system , close to town , with a house we could afford ."
"we really were n't all that concerned with "" safety "" issues per se ."
"over the last few years , major crime has <UNK> into our <UNK> ."
"in april <#> , a guy in a nearby neighborhood went on a shooting spree ."
"his first victim was his neighbor , a jewish woman ."
he drove to the next town and started shooting indian people at a grocery .
he shot - out the windows of <#> <UNK> .
"he murdered a man in a chinese restaurant , and finally shot a black karate instructor ."
"when he was done , <#> people had been murdered , <#> man was left <UNK> from the neck down ."
"i was n't very surprised , in some ways , because folks in pennsylvania love their guns and there 's a fairly ugly current of racism among some people ."
"in <UNK> to my home , some folks in the town have started to deal with diversity issues and are at least talking about them ."
"more recently , though , the pace of <UNK> has <UNK> ."
"while this murder did not happen in our town , it "" <UNK> "" involved people who do ."
"a few weeks ago , a young man murdered his girlfriend ."
"we do n't need the "" <UNK> "" in this case - he killed himself before the police could arrest him ."
"just last night , a <UNK> was shot during a domestic <UNK> ."
"while the <UNK> was shot in the chest , he was wearing a bullet - proof <UNK> and is expected to recover ."
"this level of violence in a "" safe "" <UNK> is depressing ."
i suppose it 's just a reminder that nowhere is safe .
it does n't mean we should panic and crawl in our homes and never emerged - it just means we need to be <UNK> everywhere .
<#> . i was in a train wreck with my family because my mother was afraid to fly
i was on a local tv special when i was <#> talking about space travel and the future .
why american slavery <UNK> are such a terrible idea i am politically liberal .
"i used to feel more middle - of the - road , but not so much lately ."
"and that , in theory , should mean that i am in favor of the current suit for slavery <UNK> some african americans have filed ."
"the more i have read about the suit , the more i am convinced it is a terrible idea , and i hope some judge throws it out soon ."
the suit deals with <UNK> that are over <#> years old .
none of the people who made the decisions at that time are alive today .
none of the people who were slaves are alive today .
"true , the ugly <UNK> of racism is still alive in some americans today , but it has been fading over the last <#> years or so ."
the legal <UNK> that <UNK> racist behavior has mostly been <UNK> .
"i had mixed feelings about the moves to pay slave <UNK> from world war ii , but at least a few of those <UNK> are still alive ."
for that just means that we ca n't get beyond past <UNK> .
focusing on past <UNK> means people are less likely to pay attention to current <UNK> .
does this suit mean i should be <UNK> the government because my <UNK> ( and those before them ) were not <UNK> to vote ?
almost everyone in america can find a reason to sue someone over <UNK> past <UNK> .
<UNK> will do nothing to change the lives of the people who died long ago .
"slavery does exist in our time , particularly in parts of africa and asia ."
"i 've always believed that we should learn from the past , live in the present and plan for the future ."
<UNK> over <UNK> from hundreds of years ago keeps people too tied to the past .

"first <UNK> and knight , older men whom i knew slightly ."
"then , george <UNK> <UNK> , younger and more of a friend ."
"then , very suddenly last night , bruce <UNK> ."
"bruce was "" just "" a fan , but what a fan ."
he was <#> of the first people to take collecting and recording fan history seriously .
"he was a <UNK> for many years , and had arranged to donate material he 'd collected to <UNK> <UNK> ."
he and his wife <UNK> had spent much of the last few years taking fabulous <UNK> .
they 'd been to africa and greece and alaska in recent years ; i know because he would bring his photo albums to cons and share them with us .
patrick <UNK> <UNK> keeps saying that we should stop dying .
he knows there are some things out of our control .
i 'm sure bruce did n't choose last night to die ; he was <#> and still had things in his date book beyond doctor visits .
"but , if you have a choice about it , go fast without the weeks or months of wasting away and loosing your love of life ."
"my <UNK> to <UNK> , his wife and <UNK> his daughter ."
and to the rest of us who knew him .
"today , i 'm ashamed to be an american ..."
"i find the <UNK> actions of our government , particularly under the bush administration , to be an <UNK> ."
but today 's decision to <UNK> <UNK> to the world court goes beyond the <UNK> i 've felt over the last <#> months .
how can we encourage <UNK> nations to listen to world <UNK> when we wo n't ?
this could lead to <UNK> during a time in world history when <UNK> is particularly dangerous .
"i wish president bush and his team would come to their collective senses , but i do not see it happening any time soon ."
"oh , and i 've just found out that this president does not have a public e - mail address ."
"e - mail to <UNK> <UNK> , and when you visit the web site , the contact page does not include an e - mail address ."
"<#> girls who did n't die with so much bad news about unlucky girls , i thought i 'd share <#> stories about lucky girls ."
the first <#> is <UNK> - old erica <UNK> .
she was the little girl <UNK> late monday night in philadelphia .
she was tied up and thrown in a basement .
"the <UNK> chose to wrap her in <UNK> tape , which the girl was able to chew through ."
she escaped by breaking a window and calling for help .
the second <#> is <UNK> - old megan stone .
"a star high school athlete , she developed a virus a few weeks ago that attacked her heart ."
"after a couple of days , she was on the list for a possible heart <UNK> , it looked like her heart would be so badly <UNK> ."
"but almost as rapidly as she got the virus , she got over it and walked out of the hospital with her original heart back ."
here 's the link : urllink <UNK> - <UNK>
"this morning i heard bits and pieces of npr 's weekend edition while i was running errands , and heard a surprising number of errors ."
"first john f. kennedy was born in may of <#> , meaning he was <#> when he was nominated for president in july of <#> ."
", after his election in november <#> ."
it was released in november <#> and was not a summer blockbuster at all ( though it mailed a pile of money .
check the internet movie database at <UNK> ) .
you and your guest also missed the opportunity to discuss how movie promotion changed in the <UNK> .
there were an enormous number of television commercials for <UNK> before <UNK> came out - it was the first time i remember ad <UNK> in advance of a movie .
same thing for both star wars and close encounters .
"i enjoy you and your show , but fact - checking is being increasingly ignored in the media ."
"if you ca n't get simple facts right , how can we rely on you for getting the facts right about more complicated stories ?"
"<UNK> back to <UNK> gee , has it been <#> weeks already ?"
"i 'm still reading other people 's and enjoying , but i have n't had the time to be motivated about my own ."
i am excited to be working on urllink <UNK> <#> as the <UNK> functions division director .
i 'll probably post some of my ideas here as things progress .
"if you have exhibit ideas for the <#> <UNK> , feel free to urllink send me e - mail , or talk to me in person at con jose ."
let me just close by saying : google !
"this is my <UNK> : english , united states , mount <UNK> , , <UNK> , female , <#> - <#> ! <UNK>"
"> well , i 'm not sure why i 'm bothering ."
"i hate pop - up ads , so i took the link down ."
"reaching me online ahh , for the good old days of the web ."
you could stick your e - mail address wherever you wanted to and people would send you e - mail ... ; >
"well , it has n't been like that in a while , due to spam ."
"i have an address that i only use to post on <UNK> , and i 'm up to about <#> pieces of spam a day ."
"luckily , the spam filter catches most of them ."
"seeing the <UNK> of spam , i took my e - mail off of my pages a few years ago and opted to use <UNK> forms ."
what funny about that was that it turns out <UNK> has massive security problems .
"i <UNK> my forms from <UNK> over the summer , but neglected to take <UNK> off my server ."
"so , lo , i had a <UNK> try to spam others with my <UNK> ."
sigh so i 've pulled down my <UNK> scripts and have downloaded a single <UNK> script which promises it is a bullet - proof mail <UNK> .
"if you 've been trying to reach me , i 'm sorry i 've been hard to contact ."
but there 's only so much spam you can delete in a day ....
"meeting michael and <UNK> <#> of my favorite books ( well , the first <UNK> of it , anyway ) is the amazing adventures of <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i also liked the wonder boys and mysteries of pittsburgh very much .
michael <UNK> also runs a urllink wonderful web site on top of being <#> of the better writers of our day .
"i 'd seen michael in some tv interviews , but i do n't remember having seen urllink <UNK> <UNK> before ."
"she 's also been writing , a series of mysteries called "" the mommy track . """
i bought <#> of her books as well .
"while i 've been very lucky to meet lots of writers due to my involvement in sf <UNK> , i have n't met all that many mainstream writers ."
"i met barbara <UNK> after a talk a few years ago , and that 's been about it ."
"so meeting a <UNK> prize winner , and "" local boy makes good "" was a real treat ."
he 'd give a speech every once in a while or demonstrate a rocket <UNK> in front of video cameras .
the fact that he did n't give this self - <UNK> speech on video means
i think the best way to spend tomorrow is to try to acknowledge the hit we took without <UNK> in the terror of the day .
"i do n't believe all terrorists are gone , nor do i believe that we 'll never have another terrorist attack ."
"but , as i said last december , i believe we 're more likely to have small - scale terrorist acts , not large flying bombs ."
"safety , again well , i was in silver spring , md during the recent <UNK> episode and arrived home alive ."
"or , as the button many of us bought and wore ( thanks , lee and nancy ! )"
said : no stupid <UNK> is going to ruin my convention .
"i do n't want to be too <UNK> about danger , but the <UNK> to living is getting <UNK> ."
"some of my friends have become very <UNK> ( "" if there 's a bullet out there with your name on it , that 's it "" ) ."
"increasingly , i feel like i 'm living with the religion of statistics ."
i 'm more likely to die of a stroke in my 70s than of a bullet or terrorist action in my <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> and saddam hussein so what do they have in common ?
both have a <UNK> for wearing military uniforms and growing facial hair .
"despite several adventures in the early ' <UNK> , cuba has proven to be fairly harmless ."
"when the <UNK> wanted to put nuclear <UNK> in cuba and the us government said "" no way , "" the russian government <UNK> <UNK> and nothing further happened ."
it 's clear that the iraqis have had some <UNK> capabilities .
"they <UNK> a few <#> <UNK> for almost no reason other than to say "" they could do it . """
"but , they have n't done anything else with those weapons since the early ' 90s ."
it 's not so clear that they have nuclear weapons .
it 's not that easy to <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> facilities are large and easy to spot from the air .
"it 's also not that trivial to transport <UNK> <UNK> , so it would be tough to "" secretly "" bring it in from another country ."
they do n't have <UNK> and their air force is kept pretty busy due to us <UNK> of the no - fly zone .
have representatives of al - <UNK> met with representatives of the iraqi government ?
probably . and have representatives of al - <UNK> met with other governments ?
we do n't seem to be going after other governments ( beyond getting the <UNK> mostly out of afghanistan ) .
there is no rational reason to go to war against iraq .
"while saddam hussein is dangerous , he 's much , much more dangerous to his own people than he is to the rest of the world ."
"<UNK> has worked very well , and can continue to work ."
i keep hearing we should be afraid of saddam hussein .
"it 's as if we learned absolutely nothing from september <#> - we need to be more afraid of , more <UNK> of the enemy we can not see ."
"like <UNK> <UNK> , saddam hussein is more <UNK> , someone i refuse to loose any sleep over , despite the overly - <UNK> <UNK> of our government ."
"i 've been writing web pages in raw html since <#> , and it 's the new technology that 's fucking me over !"
weird movie connections i 've been sick since getting home .
"the cold i picked up over christmas seems to have slid into being the flu ( aches , exhaustion ) , so i stayed home from work on friday ."
i 'm actually starting to feel a little better today .
"anyway , when i get sick , i tend to watch movies , as my concentration is n't generally good enough to read books ."
"true , there 's the obvious connection - <UNK> is in both ."
"he plays <UNK> <UNK> , daniel 's ( alexander <UNK> ) brother ."
"now that 's a tad <UNK> , so there are more odd little connections ."
"there 's little <UNK> <UNK> , a fine actor a few years older than <UNK> wood ."
"the <UNK> little boy roles <UNK> got in the early - mid ' 80s , <UNK> got in the early ' 90s ."
"if you check out a current picture of him in <UNK> , you 'll see that <UNK> still has a <UNK> - like face ."
"if some <UNK> director had made lotr in the ' 80s , you can see <UNK> ford would have been a natural for <UNK> ."
"finally , there 's the "" stranger in a strange land "" theme , which is pretty obvious in both films ."
"i hope to start posting in the blog a little more ; i 've started to learn about rss , so expect to see some changes here soon ."
"yes , <UNK> happened in boston for the first time since <#> ."
"there were either <#> or <#> fire <UNK> , but the hotel did n't take them personally ..."
"the con went pretty well , and sharon <UNK> now holds the record of running the world 's longest <UNK> ."
"this morning , to the surprise of absolutely no <#> , flights out of boston were cancelled due to the closure of <UNK> due to the presidents day <UNK> ."
"at about <#> am , it finally started to snow here ."
"then , after more than <#> hours , we had more than a foot of snow in downtown boston ."
"this has turned <UNK> into <UNK> , since there are about <#> of us at the airport who could n't leave boston today ."
"we might have some photos as del <UNK> , john <UNK> and bill <UNK> all had cameras ."
new line cinema - what were they thinking ?
i 've been to see the <#> towers <#> times ( so far ) .
"it 's a glorious movie , but in order to see the movie , you have to see way too many bad <UNK> ."
"now it turns out that new line cinema did produce <#> other recently - released and fairly well - <UNK> movie , namely about <UNK> ."
i always remember where i was when i hear really awful news .
"i was watching comedy central this morning , laughing at bill murray in <UNK> when i just happen to check <UNK> net <UNK> on my laptop ."
"adam troy <UNK> titled a <UNK> message at <UNK> in <UNK> with "" not again "" terrorism , i thought ."
""" it 's beginning to look like we 've lost the crew of the space shuttle columbia ... "" shit !"
i grabbed the channel <UNK> and immediately switched to nbc . and cried for about <#> minutes .
i have been a huge fan of <UNK> .
"i do n't remember the <UNK> or <UNK> flights , but <UNK> flew just after my fifth birthday and i remember that <UNK> ."
space travel is an act of supreme confidence in the future - it meant we were living in the future .
i find any death related to the space program to be <UNK> - <UNK> .
i just hope we do n't <UNK> the program for another <#> and a half years due to this tragedy .
that does n't mean it should n't be done .
"if everyone was so risk - <UNK> , we 'd still be little monkeys living on a beach in africa ."
"as the crisis <UNK> , the <#> master <UNK> will find themselves in a <UNK> where only <#> will walk away alive !"
"ok , first , when will <UNK> learn never to try and <UNK> <UNK> while he is walking through tall grass ?"
the last <#> <#> guys that tried that ended up dead .
the movie starts showing a family of chinese <UNK> traveling in japan .
"this was interesting because they were speaking chinese , so on the right side of the screen there was the japanese <UNK> running <UNK> ."
so i was distracted trying to read both the english <UNK> and the japanese <UNK> .
"the family meets and <UNK> <UNK> , who is going to a temple to demonstrate his martial arts ."
"the group ran into an official <UNK> , and like the other <UNK> on the road , <UNK> themselves ."
<#> of the samurai was about to cut him down when <UNK> <UNK> into action .
"well the samurai go <UNK> and start killing everyone , including the <UNK> ."
you might be wondering where <UNK> comes in .
he finds the boy wandering and helps him .
"eventually , <UNK> , after doing some kung fu ass - kicking , finds <UNK> and the boy ."
"well , it seems <UNK> only speaks chinese , so there is a lot of <UNK> between he and <UNK> ."
"they end up hiding at the home of a family , who witnessed the <UNK> , but escaped ."
about that time a gang boss enters the picture .
"this boss wants to find the <UNK> because if he does , his gang we be allowed to assist in the <UNK> 's <UNK> to the capital , <UNK> ."
being given this honor will raise the rank both of himself and his organization .
"so more <UNK> <UNK> , though not of the humorous kind ."
it was pretty interesting to see kung fu alongside <UNK> 's sword .
"i liked the character of <UNK> <UNK> , and the scenes where he and <UNK> try to communicate were very good ."
this is a cool site with short movies of a urllink battle <UNK> in japan .
"no good deed goes <UNK> for <UNK> , the blind <UNK> and master <UNK> ."
"immediately taking a liking to the young woman , he <UNK> to help her when her inn is turned into a <UNK> by <UNK> , the local <UNK> boss ."
things take a turn for the worse when <UNK> fights to have the <UNK> at the upcoming festival perform without <UNK> taxes .
"<UNK> by his <UNK> , <UNK> puts a price on the blind man 's head ."
"meanwhile , the baby 's father , <UNK> , returns home , and a <UNK> results in him blaming the <UNK> for his wife 's death ."
"as the danger on both sides <UNK> , <UNK> 's sword - cane will fly and the blood will flow into the streets !"
urllink <UNK> at large is the 23rd movie in the series .
it starts with <UNK> coming across a woman who had just been attacked and robbed .
"she is very pregnant , and the stress of the <UNK> has put her into labor ."
"in the town , <UNK> finds that the baby 's father is not there , but his sister , <UNK> - e is ."
"he visits her , dropping off her <UNK> nephew ."
"she <UNK> she never met her brother 's wife ( he and his wife lived in another town ) , that he was supposed to be coming with her ."
"<UNK> decides to stay in town until the father of the baby arrives , so he can tell him in person what happened ."
"while staying in town , he <UNK> the local <UNK> , who ran out the last <UNK> gang from his town ."
"of course , the very next scene has another <UNK> gang marching in ."
"the boss , <UNK> , has bought up all the <UNK> 's <UNK> , and turns the inn , where <UNK> - e works , into a <UNK> ."
"if the <UNK> can not pay , he takes their women to work in the <UNK> ."
"<UNK> - e borrowed money when her father was sick , <#> <UNK> , but now they say she now owes <#> !"
she is sure her brother will arrive the next day with the money and save her ...
you can pretty much see where this is going .
"there is also a <UNK> , hired by the boss , who turns out to really like and respect <UNK> and his skill ."
"of course , that means they must fight to the death ."
"there was a group of <UNK> in the town for a festival , and a <UNK> , a monkey trainer ."
"come for the lightning fast sword work , stay for the monkeys ."
"here 's a nice , very <UNK> site about urllink japanese swords ."
there 's enough info here to keep you busy for a while reading it all .
yesterday was our final <UNK> class until the fall .
all <#> some - odd <UNK> wandered over to a park near <UNK> 's house where we practiced for about <#> hours .
"we started with <UNK> <UNK> , <#> <#> cuts , which turned out to be more like ni <UNK> san <UNK> <UNK> , <#> <#> and <#> cuts ."
"each of us got to use the huge , <UNK> style <UNK> ."
"it is a monstrous wooden sword , both long and heavy ."
"then we worked on <#> - way cutting , then <#> - way ."
we then broke off into groups lead by the senior students and worked on urllink <UNK> <UNK> .
"then , we learned a very cool new <#> cut practice ."
"it uses the <#> basic cuts , and has the coolest ending sequence ever ."
"after that we went back to <UNK> 's and did <UNK> , test cutting ."
"we got to use a <UNK> , a live swords ."
"it was a bit <UNK> , but very cool ."
"we had rolled <UNK> <UNK> on a post , and got a few swings at it ."
"i sucked on my first few tries , but kinda got a feel for it ."
it 's amazing what a real sword urllink can do even if only to a rolled mat of rice straw .
"then there was a bbq , with all kinds of tasty foods and drink ."
"i tried some <UNK> <UNK> , which is a kind of japanese alcohol made from sweet potatoes ."
it was pretty good ... had an interesting taste .
"so all and all , it was a good day ."
the weather was beautiful and it was not too hot .
"though , i did get a bit of a sunburn ..."
"my head and nose are bright red , and i just know they are going to be hurting soon ."
"last year on japan 's <UNK> network , they showed a weekly historical drama based on the character of <UNK> <UNK> ."
"thanks to my friend chris , who has satellite power , i got to see a handful of episodes ."
"it was pretty cool , especially the actor who played <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i later discovered that he is a famous <UNK> actor , and just recently took the name of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"check out this article on urllink japan times , and all will be made clear ."
"ok , for those of you like both japanese and rpg 's , here 's a site for you : urllink <UNK> rpg ."
"i have n't really read much yet , but i plan on trying to translate my way though some of it ."
"in a town where women are bought and sold , <UNK> <UNK> upon a secret organization headed by <UNK> , the dark <UNK> lord ."
"however , a chance encounter with <#> beautiful women might be the end of <UNK> , as both a jealous husband and the town <UNK> want his head !"
urllink <UNK> and the festival of fire is the 21st movie in the series .
"turns out he is also blind , and while at first seems like he is an ok guy , he turns out to be very evil ."
the movie starts with <UNK> trying to help a woman who was bought at a slave auction to escape .
he can tell that she is a woman of higher rank and is confused as to how she got into such a circumstance .
"her jealous husband , a <UNK> , shows up as she slips away in the night ."
"he , the <UNK> , <UNK> that she has slept with <UNK> ..."
"it is usually the other way in <UNK> movies , with the women falling for him ."
it was a nice change of pace to see him <UNK> for the woman .
"of course , she is not exactly who she appears to be ."
there is <#> set piece that really stands out ; a bath house fight .
"<UNK> is <UNK> while bathing , by <UNK> sent by the boss of bosses , and the <UNK> fight scene is <#> of the best in the series ."
"it 's also pretty funny because all the <UNK> are naked , so some creative filming was done to cover that up ."
"there are a couple of other nice scenes , <#> where <UNK> draws and cuts <#> of the <UNK> 's tea cup while he is still drinking ."
the other is a game of go between <UNK> and the other blind man .
"it starts out serious , but quickly becomes silly ."
"oh , and the opening credits with <UNK> trying to get away from an overly friendly dog had me laughing out loud ."
"all things considered , this was a pretty good entry in the series , if for no other reason , the fight at the <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> for the pleasure of the <UNK> 's <UNK> daughter , princess <UNK> ."
features the famous <UNK> at the public <UNK> !
urllink the sword of adventure is the second movie in the <UNK> <UNK> series .
"of course , i watched it after watching the 4th movie ."
"well , this kind of movie series does not really require that you watch things in order ."
"the story begins in <UNK> , just before the new year celebration ."
"<UNK> meets an old man , and saves him from an <UNK> ."
it turns out the old man is the <UNK> 's finance <UNK> and has made a powerful enemy .
"the <UNK> has suggested that the <UNK> daughters ' <UNK> be cut , saying that the money could be better used serving the people ."
"<#> princess , <UNK> , used to a life of <UNK> luxury , is not pleased and wants him dead ."
"problem is , <UNK> likes the old man , and takes it on himself to look after the <UNK> ."
"after she encounters <UNK> , <UNK> finds that she both loves him and wants him dead ."
i think i liked this <#> better than urllink <UNK> .
"it did n't have all the <UNK> , religious stuff in it ."
"it was pretty straight forward , and had an excellent supporting cast ."
"plus , we get to learn a bit more about <UNK> 's famous "" full moon cut technique . """
"starting from the bottom , he slowly draws a large circle with his sword ."
"it is said that by the time he <UNK> the circle , his opponent will be dead ."
i was uncertain about this series after seeing the 4th movie .
"there was good stuff in it , but it did n't really draw me in , like this <#> did ."
i wonder if i 'll be able to find any of the others ?
"<UNK> ! yesterday in <UNK> class we did some test cutting , or <UNK> ."
<UNK> <UNK> a clothes line across the <UNK> and hung a section of newspaper from it with clothes pins .
we then worked on doing straight cuts on it with our <UNK> .
"they have no blade , but you can still cut newspaper ."
"my cut was a bit sucky , just a little on the bottom ."
"james was the man , and cut it in twain !"
i have found that i am learning some strange japanese by watching all these <UNK> .
"well , maybe not strange , just different ."
"here are some examples : han and <UNK> : han is odd , <UNK> is even ."
"these are called out during dice games , of which i 've seen about a dozen in various <UNK> movies ."
"<#> dice are thrown in a cup onto a mat , with the cup covering them ."
"of course <UNK> listens to the dice and can tell if they are han or <UNK> , and also if the dice are loaded ."
"o - samurai - <UNK> : you hear this <#> a lot , or a <UNK> , o - samurai - san ."
"as i mention in my urllink o post , o is often used as an <UNK> before a word ."
"san or <UNK> is an <UNK> added at the end of a word , so in these cases you get an <UNK> sandwich ."
you usually hear it in this sort of context : boss : you have been <UNK> by the blind <UNK> .
"i 'm sure there are others , but those are the ones that came to my mind ."
if i think of any more <UNK> post them .
i guess i could actually put a link up so people can see my first real try at <UNK> .
here is my attempt at writing urllink <UNK> .
here 's another bit of interesting language stuff from j - <UNK> .
"i knew about some of this stuff , adding "" o "" at the beginning to "" <UNK> "" the word , or give it <UNK> status ."
"english loan words never get the special "" o "" <UNK> , either ."
"the word is "" <UNK> , "" and in its <UNK> form , "" <UNK> , "" which refers to a female <UNK> organ ."
"a few weeks ago , we had a <UNK> class at the <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> used in the word are the ones for "" writing "" and "" way "" , so <UNK> is "" the way of writing . """
i 've been interested in it for a while .
"back in the <UNK> japanese class that <UNK> taught , we did a little <UNK> , and i thought it was pretty cool ."
"a friend of <UNK> 's , from japan , is a ranked <UNK> master ."
"i think she is 4th dan , but i may be mistaken ."
she gave us some very basic exercises to work on .
"it was cool , we worked at low tables set up in the <UNK> , sitting in <UNK> ."
"we learned enough strokes to make a very simple <UNK> in <UNK> , in this case "" <UNK> "" or "" oo "" , which means large or big ."
"in the fall , <UNK> hopes to have monthly <UNK> classes ."
"when a local gambling house <UNK> some <UNK> because they failed to pay their <UNK> , a rival gambling house pays their <UNK> and sets them free ."
but it 's really all just a <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> 's aid in <UNK> the competition .
"urllink <UNK> the <UNK> , the <UNK> movie in the series , is the first produced by <UNK> <UNK> , urllink <UNK> <UNK> 's own company ."
"there is a shift in tone , at least it seemed that way to me ."
"it was a little darker ... there were <#> character <UNK> , some limbs chopped off , tons of blood , and a <UNK> ."
"the farmers are being taught by a philosophical <UNK> who is teaching them better <UNK> techniques , as well as how to be better people ."
of course the town is having troubles ; there are <#> gambling bosses .
each wanting to <UNK> the farmers to their <UNK> .
"<UNK> ends up <UNK> <#> the the bosses , whom he respects as being a man of justice , and takes out the other boss and his gang ."
it is a wonderful scene ; a storm is rolling in ... thunder and lighting ...
then <UNK> shows up like the rage of a storm .
"well , this other boss turns out not to be the man of honor <UNK> thought ."
"he gets involved in the government , and you know how that goes ... a year later <UNK> returns to find things worse than before ."
the <UNK> - farmer has been arrested and is to be taken to <UNK> and tried as a <UNK> to the <UNK> .
"<UNK> comes to realize that the <UNK> is the honorable <#> , but it might be too late ..."
"it 's a pretty good <UNK> movie , not the best , but it has some interesting characters and fights ."
there are a couple of nice <UNK> moments .
"<#> is in a gambling house and involves the old "" quick <UNK> the the dice trick . """
"the other has <UNK> killing a <UNK> with a spit <UNK> , <UNK> <#> of the gambling bosses ."
"the blood is pretty cheesy , basically red water , but it is the first <#> with this level of <UNK> ."
i 'm sure they 'll get better at it .
"a <UNK> christian "" saint "" ( female , of course ! ) and a <UNK> drug - <UNK> princess both have their eye on <UNK> ."
the fact that a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> also want him dead is the least of his problems !
"this is the urllink 4th movie in the <UNK> <UNK> series , and the first i 'd seen ."
"<UNK> is a half - breed <UNK> ( his mother was japanese , his father a <UNK> ) who was <UNK> during a black mass ."
do n't see that very often in <UNK> .
"well , that and <UNK> cutting down a lot of people ."
"the plot <UNK> around a group of <UNK> , bringing <UNK> , including <UNK> into japan from china ."
"really likes killing people for fun , having christians <UNK> , killing the men she has sex with ..."
"of course , <UNK> reveals her for the monster she is ."
"the man told him , before dying , that the virgin knows the circumstances of <UNK> 's birth ."
"apparently , he does not know much about his past . and"
"another thing about <UNK> , he 's kind of a dick ."
"sure he helps people , but he is the typical <UNK> <UNK>"
"... he looks out for himself , and rarely does anything unless there 's something in it for him ."
i was surprised and pleased to see urllink <UNK> <UNK> in this .
he 's the brother of <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> ) and also famous for his <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in the lone wolf and <UNK> series of movies .
"he plays a chinese master of <UNK> in this movie , and his <UNK> with <UNK> on the deck if a <UNK> ship is excellent ."
i hope to see another <UNK> <UNK> movie later this week .
i think it will be the second in the series .
"tonight we had the last of our "" saturday night cinema "" <UNK> at <UNK> 's house , and we watched urllink <UNK> : the art of killing ."
it really is n't as <UNK> as the title suggests .
"in fact , it is a documentary from the late <#> 's about the fighting arts of japan ."
"it covers everything from <UNK> , karate - do , <UNK> , to <UNK> and lots <UNK> ."
"apparently , some of these arts had never really been seen in the west , or little was known about them ."
"of course , we were all very interested in the sword - work ."
"some amazing stuff with live swords , and the cutting ... man , the <UNK> ( practice cutting ) was <UNK> ."
"actually , a lot of the karate stuff was sweet too , and painful looking ."
"if you are interested in the japanese martial arts and can stand a cheesy <#> 's soundtrack , try and hunt this <#> down ."
"urllink <UNK> <UNK> stars in this hilarious epic of a man , a plan , and a large red <UNK> !"
i admit i was a bit <UNK> when i read the above on the back of the video tape .
i was expecting some sort of silly movie .
"sure , there was <UNK> , but also a great deal of <UNK> ."
"<UNK> plays <UNK> , a <UNK> 's son who rides into his home town wearing the red lion <UNK> , and turns everything upside down ."
"problem is , the boy ai n't quite right in the head ."
"you see , there was this <UNK> tree , and well , when <UNK> was younger he fell out and landed on his head and"
"<UNK> plays <UNK> with a certain <UNK> <UNK> , and pulls it off ."
"i was n't sure how <UNK> would be playing a comic character , but it was perfect ."
a lot has gone on the village since he left ...
well he did n't exactly leave by his choice .
"once <UNK> shows up and see how thing are , he sets about changing them ."
"he is after all a high ranking official in the <UNK> <UNK> force , right ?"
"that is pretty much the premise of the movie , with the first half having most of the humor , and the second half becoming deadly serious ."
a couple of other characters really stood out for me .
"<#> was the <UNK> , <UNK> who is rather proud of his ability to count in english , and does so at every <UNK> moment ."
"he also <UNK> that not everything is on the up and up with <UNK> , but follows him nonetheless ."
"the other is the <UNK> hired to killed <UNK> , but always gets interrupted , or changes his mind ."
"<UNK> can not seem to figure this <UNK> out , and ends up calling him a "" <UNK> "" during every <#> of their encounters ."
"no matter who is in control , the <UNK> is still at the bottom . as i mentioned earlier"
", there is more than just comedy to this movie , much more ."
"there 's some good fight scenes with some real <UNK> of blood , and some <UNK> heads thrown in too ."
"in the closing minutes , the <UNK> <UNK> become a true hero to the people , which of course , he thought he was all along ..."
so tonight we learned the rest of <UNK> <UNK> .
"another cut is performed , then the typical <UNK> ( awareness ) sequence is done ."
"except <UNK> acted as <UNK> again , grabbing the sword , letting us throw him ."
then we had to do the draw on him .
"granted , our swords are not sharp , but they have a sharp point that we were pointing <UNK> at his chest . a little nerve - <UNK> ."
"oh , and we did the <UNK> with him really holding on to the sword , like an opponent actually would ."
"it was hard as hell to do the <UNK> , to get him off balance , but it was a good exercise ."
"next week , our last regular class until the fall , we are going to go over all <#> <UNK> that we now know ."
i guess i should explain <UNK> a but .
"furthermore , <UNK> is a martial way ( <UNK> ) based on the <UNK> of <UNK> ."
"as it is said : "" the sword and zen act in <UNK> . """
<UNK> practices its techniques with a humble and modest heart and continually trains the spirit .
"however , the more <UNK> breakdown of <UNK> <UNK> its deeper purpose ."
""" i "" means "" to be "" or "" to sit "" and "" ai "" means "" harmony "" while "" <UNK> "" means "" art . """
so together <UNK> can be viewed as the art of the harmony of being .
"the <UNK> ( <UNK> of <UNK> ) practices not to defeat others , but rather to defeat the things within them that prevent their self - development ."
<UNK> is practiced as a series of <UNK> ( or forms . )
each <UNK> begins with the individual calmly sitting or standing with their sword <UNK> .
"then , <#> or more perceived <UNK> suddenly attack the individual ."
"in addition to its <UNK> focus on <UNK> , <UNK> also <UNK> awareness , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> related to handling the sword and the self ."
"for a little over a year now , i 've been practicing urllink <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"in that time i 've learned a lot , and had some ups and downs in my training ."
"i 'll be the first to admit that i really need to practice more , but lately i 've been cracking down on myself ."
"it has n't been too hard , mainly because we 've started learning some really interesting stuff ."
"that is not to say that the stuff we learned before was not interesting , it 's just the new things have really clicked with me ."
"for <#> thing , we have learned <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , cutting in <#> directions ."
", that is the kind of cut we perform , but <UNK> wanted to spice things up a bit ."
"now we do a cut , then <UNK> to another direction , do another cut , <UNK> , etc ."
"many of the later <UNK> use the <UNK> , and he thought it would good for us to start leaning it ."
we have also leaned cutting in <#> direction from a <UNK> position .
"while i like the multi - <UNK> cuts , i still need to work on it ... sometimes i get a bit off balance ."
"the thing i really like is the 6th <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"the basic premise is that <UNK> , your opponent , has grabbed the <UNK> ( <UNK> ) of your sword ."
it is your job to shake him off .
"it 's a really interesting <UNK> , that is very <UNK> like , ending with <UNK> being flipped onto his back ."
we have only learned up to that point so far .
tomorrow in class we will learn the draw and cut .
another thing <UNK> has had us do is go outside the <UNK> and work on cutting practice in the side yard .
"ok , cutting while wearing <UNK> ( sandals ) in grass , not easy ."
<#> of japan 's <UNK> actors star in this classic tale of greed and <UNK> .
"<UNK> a village he has fond memories of , only to find that much has changed ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> have caused the village to fall into the hands of the evil <UNK> clan , run by <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> son <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's other son has married into the respectable family that runs the <UNK> mint .
<UNK> 's keen <UNK> leads him to the center of the conspiracy and <UNK> the family <UNK> .
"swords will slash , battles with rage , and blood will flow when <UNK> meets <UNK> !"
"first , i guess i should say a few words about <UNK> ."
"he is a blind <UNK> , and <UNK> . and"
"but , he has a code , and is not keen on <UNK> being <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> movies fall <UNK> into the <UNK> <UNK> category , with quite a bit of <UNK> thrown in , with <UNK> as the classic anti - hero ."
"this is the 20th <UNK> movie , and is commonly know as urllink <UNK> meets <UNK> ."
it starts with <UNK> going to a village he 'd visited a few years earlier .
"well , it would be a pretty sucky <UNK> movie if he found such a place , eh ?"
"of course , the village is <UNK> by <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
there is a lot going on in the plot and it took me a bit to wrap my head around it .
"the <UNK> is a bit of a <UNK> , who has a thing for the female lead , who is a <UNK> ."
"he plans on getting enough money so she can buy out her contract and become free , free to leave with him ."
"several other interesting , morally <UNK> characters round out the cast ."
"there is something to do with the official mint , and gold being <UNK> away from it ."
"oh , and a cool samurai character who is equally deadly with a <UNK> as he is with a <UNK> ."
and why does he seem to know the <UNK> ?
"he has such a presence and <UNK> when he is on screen , and his scenes with <UNK> 's <UNK> are wonderful ."
"it was a cruel prank , but it had me laughing the whole time ."
"also the way the <UNK> <UNK> says "" <UNK> "" back to his <UNK> employer , <UNK> , is priceless ."
"even though this movie is late in the series , it would be a good introduction to the <UNK> movies ."
"it <UNK> many of the elements of previous <UNK> movies , but that is a good thing . and"
"<UNK> <UNK> , a fellow <UNK> geek , lent me a movie last week at <UNK> class , called urllink <UNK> in japanese , translated to <UNK> ."
the subject matter was not traditional <UNK> fare .
"the major theme in <UNK> is that of homosexuality among the samurai class , a topic not often <UNK> ."
it takes place in <#> among the <UNK> .
"the <UNK> were <UNK> in <UNK> , and were a sort of elite police force for the <UNK> ."
"it had <UNK> <UNK> , and it was interesting to see homosexuality <UNK> in this historical period ."
"though , i think that the true theme of the movie is that of lust and power being destructive forces ."
"<UNK> uses the lust that others have for him to give himself more power . also rumors play an important , and again , destructive role in the film ."
"obviously , i do n't want to give too much away ."
"urllink <UNK> <UNK> , who played <UNK> , has a <UNK> look about him , but there is danger beneath the surface ."
"<UNK> is a famous director , who recently wrote , directed , and stared in urllink <UNK> ."
"i think this editorial review sums it up more <UNK> than me : this fascinating , gorgeous film <UNK> homosexual passions among the samurai of an <#> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> centers around a young samurai named <UNK> , whose smooth face and soft beauty makes him an object of desire ."
"rumors about who might be his lover lead to a love triangle , <UNK> <UNK> , and a mysterious murder ."
japanese <UNK> beat <UNK> plays a samurai captain struggling to maintain order in the ranks .
"basically it is a japanese period movie , usually set before the <UNK> <UNK> ( when the emperor was <UNK> , thus ending the age of the <UNK> . )"
"as such , they are stories about samurai , historical persons or events , even <UNK> and horror stories ."
most people in the west are familiar with the <UNK> works of urllink <UNK> <UNK> .
"urllink <#> samurai , urllink <UNK> , urllink hidden <UNK> , and many others ."
under the heading of <UNK> there are <#> sub - <UNK> :
"of course , sword - fighting is <UNK> to all of these types , which is why the blanket term of <UNK> is usually used ."
it is my plan to discuss and review various <UNK> on this blog .
"i am by no means an expert on the genre , nor have a seen more than a tiny <UNK> of what is out there ."
"oh , i should mentioned that the name of this blog , urllink <UNK> <UNK> , is the title of <#> of my favorite <UNK> ."
"actually , it 's <#> of my favorite movies , period ."
"i had grown weary of it and decided i needed a fresh start , and maybe a little more focus ."
"over the weekend i <UNK> what to do , and came to a decision ..."
"i would do the blog on stuff that i 'm interested in , namely japanese stuff ."
"specifically , <UNK> , <UNK> and japanese language and culture ."
"i will go more into each of those topics soon , when i 'm not blogging from work ..."
<UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> samurai trilogy is based on the novel that has been called japan 's gone with the wind .
this sweeping saga of the <UNK> <UNK> - century samurai <UNK> <UNK> ( <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> ) plays out against the <UNK> of a devastating civil war .
the trilogy follows <UNK> 's <UNK> from <UNK> youth to enlightened warrior .
"in the first part , urllink <UNK> <UNK> , the hero 's dreams of military glory end in <UNK> , defeat , and a <UNK> lifestyle ."
but he is saved by a woman who loves him and <UNK> priest who guides him to the samurai path .
this installment won the <#> academy award for best foreign film .
i 've had this dvd for a year now and finally watched it .
now i 'm going to have to break down an get the other <#> parts .
"yep , the movie is a trilogy , and this first part sets the stage ."
"we are introduced to the wild youth , <UNK> ( who later becomes <UNK> . )"
"he talks his childhood <UNK> , <UNK> , into joining him in the army in search of honor and glory ."
"the <#> run off , <UNK> leaving his <UNK> <UNK> behind ."
they soon find out that there is not as much glory or honor as they thought .
"after a battle with a gang who wants a cut of the women 's <UNK> , <UNK> runs off with the women , leaving <UNK> to return home ."
"he does , but finds that he is a <UNK> , <UNK> by the local authorities ."
"the only people who seem concerned for him is <UNK> , <UNK> 's heart - broken love , and <UNK> , a buddhist priest ."
"<UNK> 's mother <UNK> <UNK> for taking her son away , and want him to pay ."
and <UNK> finds herself falling in love with him ...
the movie is based on the novel <UNK> written by <UNK> <UNK> that was published in serial form from <#> until <#> .
"i have to admit , i have the translation of the book , but have not read it yet ."
maybe at some point i will read it .
"as usual , <UNK> is excellent , but i really liked <UNK> <UNK> who played the priest <UNK> ."
"there is not much more to say about this , as it is the opening chapter ."
hopefully i will get to the see the other <#> soon ...
"urllink brian <UNK> , the <UNK> of the violent <UNK> , is a <UNK> player ."
"his site has a lot of information about the instrument as well some <UNK> from his <UNK> albums , which i must get !"
i found a cool site called urllink zen stories to tell your neighbors .
"there are a few dozen short zen stories , some of which i 'd heard before in longer form ."
"he quickly apologized , but the rather <UNK> soldier demanded that the matter be settled in a sword <UNK> ."
"the tea master , who had no experience with swords , asked the advice of a fellow zen master who did possess such skill ."
"the soldier , <UNK> himself to strike , stared for a long time into the fully <UNK> but calm face of the tea master ."
"finally , the soldier lowered his sword , apologized for his arrogance , and left without a blow being struck ."
"here 's a short interview with urllink <UNK> <UNK> , the actor who i mentioned in my review of the new <UNK> movie ."
<UNK> is a blind <UNK> who makes a living by gambling and giving <UNK> . behind his humble <UNK>
"in a gambling joint , <UNK> and <UNK> young friend <UNK> meet up with a couple of <UNK> ."
<UNK> and her sister <UNK> have come to town to <UNK> their parents ' murder .
"with his <UNK> sword cane at his side , <UNK> 's path is destined for many violent <UNK> ..."
"i 'd seen this movie a few months ago , but did not write a review for a few reasons ."
the conditions under which i watched it were less than idea .
"the group i saw it with was filled with a peanut gallery who commented and giggled throughout , making it difficult to absorb the movie ."
"secondly , early that day i had eaten something that did not agree with me , and the second half of the movie had me in massive <UNK> pain ."
"last month i picked up an overseas dvd of the movie , and finally got around to watching it again ."
"sadly , <UNK> <UNK> passed away in <#> ."
"noted director and actor urllink beat <UNK> takes over the <UNK> , playing urllink <UNK> as well as writing and directing the movie ."
"he plays the <UNK> much differently from <UNK> , but i kinda liked his <UNK> ."
"in this movie , he is very <UNK> , mysterious ."
"he does not talk much , but his actions speak for him ."
"many of themes and <UNK> are lifted directly from the earlier movies , which gives the movie a feeling of <UNK> ."
<#> thing <UNK> adds is a lot of humor .
there are a few real laugh - out - loud moments for me .
the main story is that of the <UNK> trying to <UNK> the murder of their parents .
"they have been <UNK> hunting down and killing all those involved , and after their paths cross with <UNK> , it becomes his cause too ."
"i should , at this point mention <UNK> 's <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"then there 's the <UNK> <UNK> boy that runs around the house with a <UNK> , shouting ."
i wo n't even try to explain it .
"oh , then there 's the tap dancing ."
"the fights were nice and deadly , with <UNK> blood taking the place of the <UNK> of the <#> 's and <#> 's ."
"for me , the stand out role is the character of <UNK> <UNK> , played by urllink <UNK> <UNK> ."
"he plays a <UNK> hired by a gang in the village as a <UNK> , and is told to take out <UNK> ."
"he character wants nothing more than to get money to save is very sick wife , and is a good man stuck in a bad situation ."
i thought the actor looked familiar to me ; he had been in urllink <UNK> .
he is a very good actor and i 'd like to see more of his work .
it was nice to see the blind <UNK> <#> more time .
"and as a side effect , interest in <UNK> 's movies has increased again , both in japan and the states ."
can never have to much <UNK> as far as i 'm concerned .
"there are many , many ways to say "" i "" in japanese ."
""" <UNK> "" is a nice gender neutral <#> ."
""" <UNK> "" is a bit <UNK> sounding and is often used by males ."
""" <UNK> "" is used sometimes by women ."
"there are also many ways to say "" you . """
urllink the japan <UNK> has a page that urllink lists a lot of them .
"well , the back of the dvd did n't have a plot <UNK> for me to put here ,"
so i guess i 'll have to get right down to business .
"this is the urllink 26th and final <UNK> movie that <UNK> <UNK> made , and in some ways , it 's the ultimate <UNK> movie ."
"i do not mean it is the best , because it certainly is not , but it <UNK> the best elements from the previous <UNK> ."
"think of it as a "" best of "" collection ."
all of the components are there ... almost .
"the story , sadly , is a little weak ."
"really , the movie shines the most when <UNK> is on screen ."
<UNK> stepped right back into his alter - ego after a <#> year <UNK> .
"there are several excellent set pieces , mostly the fights , that are some of the best i 've seen ."
that 's saying a lot when you consider that <UNK> was almost <#> when he filmed this .
"the blood <UNK> are pretty over the top in some places , but that is to be expected , it 's a late <#> 's movie ."
i ca n't even begin to describe it .
it 's a kind of <UNK> - like thing .
that does not make it better -- quite the contrary .
"now i do n't want you to get the impression that i did n't like this movie , i did !"
"the <UNK> series does not go out with a bang , but it does not go out with a <UNK> either , so that 's something ."
but things never stay quite for the <UNK> for very long .
"an old face from <UNK> 's childhood , <UNK> , has <UNK> a <UNK> plot to rob the town of their valuable community <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> is caught in the <UNK> position of <UNK> the conflict between his former pal and the home of his youth , with neither side willing to <UNK> ."
"can <UNK> , the champion of the weak and <UNK> , do the right thing , even if it <UNK> him against his childhood <UNK> ?"
"so , was there any reference to <UNK> getting his hands pierced in the last movie ."
"the movie starts with <UNK> running into <UNK> and her gang of "" husbands . """
"basically she <UNK> guys , and her gang beats them up and <UNK> their money ."
so he 's in no mood to play .
"once he gets to his home town , he is grabbed by some wealthy guys and brought to work his <UNK> skills on a wealthy <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> turns out to be <UNK> , an old childhood friend , but he acts all high and mighty and <UNK> not to know <UNK> ."
"later <UNK> meets a young woman , <UNK> , who was raised by the same woman that raised him after his mother died ."
"<UNK> was born after <UNK> left the village but heard many tales about him from the old woman , who had recently passed away ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> visit the woman 's grave and the house they were both brought up , with <UNK> feeling a bond with his new found "" sister . """
"well , you know things ca n't remain peaceful for long ."
there are some <UNK> people in the town .
"the <UNK> has been <UNK> the farmers taxes buy having the tax box be bigger than it should , making them have to put more into it ."
"<UNK> steps in and pays the extra money the farmers owe , but he has <UNK> motives ."
"he takes over the farmer 's <UNK> , and begins getting stone from it to sell , which is what he had planned the whole time ."
"then <UNK> meets <UNK> , and decides he wants her ."
you know that 's not going to go over well with <UNK> ...
"it was a good <#> minutes into the film before we get any real sword work , and i 'm not saying that 's a bad thing ."
"this is another character driven episode , which are always a nice change of pace ."
we get another glimpse into the life of <UNK> before he became <UNK> .
"when we do get sword work , it is , as always , very nice ."
"some good <UNK> of blood , some limbs chopped off ."
"a personal favorite of mine , the cutting of the dice came up ."
"never , ever , try and switch the dice on <UNK> ."
"so the next <UNK> movie i 'll review will be from <#> , <#> years after this <#> ."
is it wrong that i desperately want to see urllink this ?
i guess it 's all the ultra - man that i watched as a kid ...
"yeah , i 'll blame it on that ."
"i had a urllink post a few weeks ago about the newly famous <UNK> actor , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , linking to an article on the japan times site ."
"a few days ago , <UNK> daily news had an article about him too , which can be found urllink here ."
"<UNK> tends to be a bit more <UNK> - y , if you will , than japan times , but it is still an interesting read ."
"after a fatal encounter with an elderly woman on a <UNK> <UNK> bridge , <UNK> seeks out her daughter , to make <UNK> for his role in her death ."
"he finds that the daughter , <UNK> , is the most popular <UNK> in the local <UNK> ."
"<UNK> to save <UNK> from this life of sin , he sets out to earn the money to <UNK> her ."
but the blind <UNK> goes too far when he <UNK> the local <UNK> gang for the money .
"now , trouble comes from all sides as the local boss , a master <UNK> and the <UNK> 's lover , all want a piece of <UNK> ."
"this the urllink 24th <UNK> film , and was directed by <UNK> <UNK> himself , <#> of the <#> <UNK> films he directed ."
it starts with <UNK> <UNK> an old woman while crossing a <UNK> old rope bridge .
she is playing the <UNK> and he compliments her .
"they talk a little and he <UNK> that she is going to a nearby town to visit her daughter , <UNK> ."
<UNK> feels pity for this old woman and offers a little money for her travels .
"as she walks over to him to get the money , she loses her <UNK> and falls to her death from the bridge ."
"the town is on the coast , with a rather famous red - light district , a place where <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> is working ."
he <UNK> to her and promises to buy her contract and her freedom .
there is a <UNK> boat that is being used as a gambling hall .
"many of the <UNK> <UNK> there and have lost everything , their <UNK> and boats ."
the <UNK> boss that runs the place says they can get them back once their <UNK> have been paid .
"<UNK> that , a <UNK> boss who is a dick ."
"well anyway , <UNK> arrives and does <#> of my favorite "" <UNK> gambling <UNK> , "" with the dice outside the cup and the dice up his sleeve ."
""" you people are not <UNK> on the dice outside the cup are you ?"
he <UNK> them as he <UNK> up all their money .
"he buys <UNK> 's freedom , but she is not content ."
"she has a guy , <UNK> , and he is pissed that <UNK> bought her contract , something he had been trying to save money for ."
"he works for the boss , and had indeed lost a ton of money to <UNK> and his <UNK> ."
"the boss has wants to kill <UNK> , and impress his boss ..."
"before the final <UNK> , <UNK> gets both of his hands pierced by <UNK> ."
he ends up <UNK> his sword to his hand to fight .
"while ot the best entry in the series , it was still good ."
"<UNK> was a pretty good director , and set up some interesting shots ."
i really liked the way he shot a fight between <UNK> and <#> <UNK> on the beach .
"since the town was on the coast , we got a lot of nice shots of the sea ."
i could have done without the cheesy sequence of the woman falling from the bridge .
"the fact that we see the falling sequence over and over , every time <UNK> remembered the event did not help ."
there was a <UNK> of another young girl who works at the brother and her brother .
"it is a sad story , but seemed sort of out of place ."
"i guess the point is that <UNK> should have been saving them and not <UNK> , who did n't really want to be saved ."
"we end with <UNK> , hands ruined , walking alone down the beach ."
i wonder if they next movie will have him dealing with his wounds ?
i 'm not going to hold my breath .
<UNK> is not always a strong point with the <UNK> movies .
there 's a lot of interesting things over at urllink the japanese <UNK> . today
"i direct you to the page titled urllink "" how to speak like a samurai . """
"most of the words and phrases are older , <UNK> ways of saying things ."
there are some urllink wacky <UNK> of ice cream in japan .
"you know , i think i 'll just stick with chocolate , thanks ."
"wow , i 've been doing the blog for a month now , and i 'm not sick of it ."
"<#> posts so far , <#> if you count this <#> ."
here are the movie reviews that i 've done so far .
"dang , there 's a lot of them ."
urllink <UNK> urllink <UNK> urllink <UNK> urllink <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> ( <#> )
urllink <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> ) urllink shin <UNK> : <UNK> !
"this is the movie that introduced the legend of <UNK> and its star <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> in a new ear of the japanese samurai film ."
"practicing his trade as a <UNK> in a small <UNK> , <UNK> finds himself caught in a <UNK> war between rival <UNK> <UNK> ."
"aware of <UNK> 's reputation as an <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> leader <UNK> tries to hire him -- <UNK> -- as a <UNK> ."
"the other gang leader , <UNK> , <UNK> a warrior with an equally fierce reputation to challenge <UNK> ."
thus the legend of <UNK> begins with <UNK> <UNK> battle scenes and an <UNK> <UNK> story .
"well , i decided to start from the beginning ."
i pulled the first <UNK> movie off the shelf and popped it in .
"i 've spend the last <#> months watched the end of the series , but i got the craving to go back and start over ."
"this is in no small part due to the fact the movies <#> , <#> , and <#> come out later this month ."
i 'd like to watch everything up to that point by the time they come out .
"that 's an awful lot of movies to watch , but i 'm sure i can do it !"
the boss had been kind to <UNK> and told him he was welcome in his house if he ever came to <UNK> .
"<UNK> is about to start a gang war with his rival in the nearby town of <UNK> , and wants <UNK> to fight for him ."
"it seems the <UNK> gang has hired a <UNK> of <UNK> skill , and <UNK> thinks having <UNK> on his side with make things even ."
you could say that this movie is the template for about half the following <UNK> movies and you would not be wrong .
"but there is something about this <#> ... a lot of it for me is the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> , the <UNK> ."
"they meet <#> morning at a nearby lake , both of them fishing , and become fast friends ."
"this is of course before they know they have been hired by the rival <UNK> to fight each other , but"
"even after they learn of this fact , they are friendly , drinking sake together at the temple the <UNK> is staying at ."
"<UNK> is dying of <UNK> , and want to <UNK> with <UNK> before he dies , much to the dismay of the blind man ."
"we are also introduced to <UNK> , a young women who falls for <UNK> ."
"her brother , <UNK> , is a <UNK> who works for <UNK> ."
"he is trying to get <UNK> to return to her former lover , another <UNK> , but she does not want to be with him ."
"it is interesting to point out that the character of <UNK> actually appears in <#> more <UNK> movies , so you 'll hear more about her ."
"i was happy to see this , and had forgotten it happened so soon ."
another is when <UNK> <UNK> his sword drawing for <UNK> 's gang .
"he throws a lit candle into the air , and cuts it in half , both sides still lit ."
"i have to say , even after seeing almost all the other <UNK> movies , that this <#> is <#> of my favorites ."
check out urllink this page over at <UNK> to learn what some common animals say .
there are even sound files so you can hear them .
"not too many reviews last month , and almost all <UNK> movies ."
"i need to branch out a bit , eh ?"
urllink samurai <#> : <UNK> <UNK> urllink shin <UNK> <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> ) urllink shin <UNK> <UNK> : <UNK> no <UNK> ( <#> )
"well , another year <UNK> on and i make it to <#> !"
wow - where has the last year gone ?
i know that the last <#> hours for me has been quite full on !
"started on friday with my birthday - it was nice , thanks tina and co :-) a nice easy transition into <#> ."
well it was my leaving do from my current work place .
a nice evening with friends from the ward at <UNK> 's italian pizza restaurant .
an <UNK> week which kicked off with the annual drug update <UNK>
the last <#> hair <UNK> have closed since i started visiting them ( not sure if there is a connection there )
so i <UNK> down a new <#> to try .
"whilst sat in the chair , i thought - what the hell ! !"
"my old friend mr <UNK> always has his <UNK> and chopped , so i thought i would give it a go ."
the hair dresser then informed me that you can now get a grade <#> <UNK> which was quite popular in today 's <UNK> .
so i went for it : grade <#> all over the top and grade <#> - <#> at the back .
ye <UNK> ! ! sometime of just yet .
"for those that know me , keep an eye on the bump blog for the latest details ."
"after rushing across <UNK> in the mad rush hour traffic , i finally made it to the <UNK> to go watch the day after tomorrow ."
"sold out - so next on the list was the latest harry potter movie , the <#> where someone <UNK> from a prison ."
"i 'm not sure if it was because i was looking forward to the other movie but to be honest , i found the movie kinda boring !"
"it did n't really grab my attention , and seemed really blank and drawn out in places ."
"there are some nice special effects , especially i thought the moving tree and the horse come chicken come bird creature ."
"none the less , there was nothing ground breaking just more of the same but done better ."
"still , at least i have <UNK> to look forward to still :-)"
"for me , someone who ca n't help but take things apart , it was only a matter of time before my xbox got taken apart ."
now i 've done it i 'm even more excited than before .
that little <UNK> could be re - built into anything - only my imagination is the limit ! !
"it 's a pc in a box , crying to be <UNK> !"
i had a meeting with my principal in the office this morning .
"while i was waiting for him to finish up a few things , i hung out and observed the enormous number of kids who came in <UNK> ."
"each student who is <UNK> has to come into the office , give an excuse to <#> of the office ladies and then get a pass written for them ."
there were <#> office ladies busy for at least ten minutes .
what i ca n't understand is this -- school starts at the same time every day .
students are allowed to come onto campus <#> minutes before school starts .
"with that window , you 'd think parents could get a handle on arrival time and actually get their kid to school on time ."
"today is a "" spirit day "" , "" twin day "" to be precise ."
"students dress like <#> another and the class with the most "" twins "" wins ... an extra recess ."
i actually spent <#> minutes of class time yesterday demanding that kids organize their wardrobe choices for today .
"i encouraged the exchange of phone numbers , the writing of notes , whatever it took for my class to get the highest percentage of students dressed like twins !"
now i just have to deal with the fall out of <#> third graders all <UNK> up because they 're wearing the same thing as their friend .
"* sigh * i guess it 's better than the "" candy day "" nightmare of <#> ..."
"now , when i was in third grade , i was <#> of these kids ."
"the "" like this ? "" kid , who never wanted to get it wrong ."
"who desperately studied the teacher model , wanting to make mine just like hers ."
"as a teacher , i ca n't stand these kids ."
"they drive me crazy and i often find my self putting off starting projects i know will cause these kids to jump into "" like this ? "" mode ."
"i want to tell my students who are so concerned with "" getting it right "" to just relax ."
"if you ca n't mess up now , when can you ?"
no <#> wants to see <#> identical art projects posted outside the classroom .
explaining this to a third grader would be like explaining <UNK> physics .
"they would all nod their heads , agree with me and then say "" so , like this , right ? """
"<UNK> i was reading some animal reports and came across the fact that <#> of the animals was related to the "" <UNK> "" ."
and i had to giggle ... and wonder -- is that a <UNK> that would prefer to remain anonymous ?
"we are very , very ready for the end of school ."
"the kids , no matter how early or late the school calendar goes , sense about <#> weeks before school is over and stop ."
never really let the kids know when school is suppose to let out .
"just all of a sudden <#> day tell them "" surprise ! school out !"
thought i 'd give this urllink friday <#> thing a try : <#> .
what was the first thing you ever cooked ?
it 's still my favorite dinner - for - breakfast food .
for everyone else it 's this taco soup recipe i stole from my friend margaret .
"( tasted like crap , did n't work , etc . )"
"the first time i made fried chicken it was beautiful , golden , <UNK> brown on the outside and raw on the inside ..."
"<#> . if skill and money were no object , what would make for your dream meal ?"
<UNK> in this amazing tomato cream sauce that a local italian restaurant ( urllink mama <UNK> 's ) makes .
"of course , if i could make it i would weigh <#> pounds ."
<#> . what are you doing this weekend ?
my husband heads out of town so it 's just me and the baby .
i look forward to cleaning the house and having it stay <UNK> for longer than <#> hours ( but i will miss my husband ) .
"over the weekend , my husband had a bad cough and he said to me , "" i think i have <UNK> cough ."
"to which i replied ( in the know - it - all way that i have ) "" no , there 's a <UNK> for that ."
"hardly anyone gets that anymore . """
the next day in the paper : urllink <UNK> cough breaks out at <UNK> hospital .
"i have students who are so <UNK> , it <UNK> the mind ."
"these are the kids who , when we get down to the lunch room , say "" we were going to lunch ?"
"can i go get my lunch box ? """
i am a fairly organized person and these kids drive me crazy !
"unfortunately , these are also the kids that need to sit in the front of the room or right next to my desk ."
all day long i 'm surrounded by them .
and then there are the kids who are smart and funny and really together .
they never get to sit by me ... * sigh *
"this morning driving to work , it was so beautiful out !"
the sun was just coming up and there was this <UNK> glow .
the shadows were <UNK> and there was <UNK> on the ground .
it was the kind of morning that tricks <UNK> into moving here .
yesterday i drove up to visit a friend of mine who lives north of seattle ( from where i live south of seattle ) in the pouring rain .
it was about an hour drive which gave me a chance to ponder certain things ( and you a chance to see the <UNK> side of erin ) .
<UNK> would you stuff that little back shelf in your car with stuffed animals unless you wanted to be <UNK> and <UNK> ?
get off the road ! or at least stay in the right lane .
i 'm glad that 's out of my system .
"so , the week is over and next week it 's back to work ."
i ca n't say i 'm really looking forward to returning .
"all you out there who are not teachers and work pretty much every week are feeling very sad for me , i know ."
just take a peek at my paycheck before you hate me for my time off :)
"well , i finished my little sewing project on tuesday ."
i have n't been on - line in a few days .
i always have all these grand plans for my time off .
usually i think something like <UNK> just stay at home for a change and do nothing .
"i 'll clean the house , read a book , play with the baby , walk the dogs ."
"then , much like this week , i will make plans upon plans and finally spend <#> day trying to <UNK> all my chores in ."
"that said , i have had some fun the last couple days ."
i had some moms and babies from my mommy group over .
"i have also watched some movies on video ( no , not dvd -- i'm a teacher , remember ?"
i have no money for fancy - <UNK> technology . )
my husband hates my taste in movies so i do n't seem to watch many anymore .
i spent most of my weekend watching the urllink trading spaces marathon on urllink <UNK> .
"i 'm addicted to that show ( "" where neighbors trade houses for <#> hours and <UNK> <#> room ... "" ) ."
it 's pretty funny to watch when the <UNK> takes over and then the people hate what he/she has done .
"inspired by the show , i spent today at my mom 's house watching trading spaces and working on a couple of sewing projects ."
i 've never taken any sort of home <UNK> .
"class or been taught to <UNK> , but for some reason i always dramatically <UNK> my sewing <UNK> ."
""" it 's pushing fabric through a machine in a straight line , "" i tell myself . """
"well , as i found out today , much more difficult than i had anticipated ."
i had <#> projects planned and i thought i could get <#> done and the other at least started .
"the other ( throw pillows for our bedroom -- to go with the new <UNK> , of course ) i did n't even start ."
"since i have all next week off , maybe i 'll actually be able to finish the <UNK> and get the pillows done before i go back to work ..."
"i was half watching an old episode of urllink buffy the other night and the character willow says "" i 'm very seldom <UNK> "" ."
this little phrase has just been floating around in my head for the last couple days .
"today , while talking with my principal , we started discussing <#> of my students ."
she 's the kind of student that drives teacher 's crazy .
"and i like her , i really like her ."
"but when my principal and i were talking today , i realized that she is exactly the kind of girl"
i would have been if i had had the guts .
i would have loved to have blown off my teachers and just read a book hidden in my desk all day . or snuck candy all day long .
"however , with both my parents being teachers , i was very seldom naughty ."
( was that a really long story just to get that point ? )
i just saw billy joel on the <UNK> .
i drive myself crazy when i 'm like this .
i make a list and do things in order and then check things off .
not so lately ... the end is in sight .
"when i was younger ( much , much younger ) , i had this book called something like "" the great clean up "" ."
it was all about a girl whose room is a messy pit .
i think her mom tells her to clean it up and she has visions of running away .
"anyways , she does a big clean up ( as the title would <UNK> ) and her room becomes perfectly organized ."
i specifically remember her getting a large cardboard box which she uses to throw away a bunch of junk .
"as a result of this , and my procrastination as far as putting papers in my grade book , my classroom has many piles of papers everywhere ."
i feel the urge to get a large cardboard box and start tossing .
what will actually happen is that i will <UNK> enter scores from all of those papers tonight so i can start report cards tomorrow ...
then i 'll get that large cardboard box and start the great room clean up .
"<UNK> yesterday ... at the end of each wing of my school , there is a staff bathroom ."
"the term "" staff bathroom "" makes it sound much more <UNK> than it is ."
it 's actually a <UNK> <UNK> closet with a toilet .
but that 's not the impression the kids have ... girl <#>
"girl <#> : it 's the "" staff bathroom "" ."
"yeah , it 's way cool in there ."
i was inside said bathroom when i heard this .
"for those of you who do not live in western washington ( state ) , this is very unusual , especially for march ."
"unfortunately , it was my <UNK> letting me know that she was sick and could n't watch baby boy today ."
she is awesome and ca n't help getting sick .
"i quickly called my parents and they said they 'd take the baby today ( they , too , are awesome people ) ."
"dress him in <UNK> - like , too - small clothes ."
run back downstairs with baby and set him on the floor to play while i pack his meals ( and mine ) .
"at this point in my little story you may be asking yourself ,"
"so , i manage to get everything together , in the car , and get on the way when i happen to glance at my gas <UNK> ."
now a stop at the gas station is required .
the good news is that traffic is pretty light which is just about a miracle considering it <UNK> earlier and i live in the seattle area .
no wonder it 's only half way through the day and i 'm already wiped out .
did i mention that the <UNK> for our butterfly unit came
<#> weeks early so i 'm now frantically planning for that ...
my class is taking a <UNK> test of basic skills this week .
it has to be the most boring thing we do .
"however , it gives me a chance to observe the kids without them realizing it ."
i will never understand why third graders are so <UNK> of pencil <UNK> .
they try to see how long they can make them with out breaking them .
they keep them in plastic <UNK> in their <UNK> ( which i admit is better than on the floor ) .
several of them are playing with them right now .
urllink radio <UNK> i commute to work about <#> minutes each way .
most of this commute time is spent listening to the radio ( although i do put on cds now in then out of commercial frustration ) .
here are a couple of the things i 've heard in the past week : out damn santa 's little <UNK> ?
he did a little scene for us radio <UNK> and it was actually kind of funny .
it 's been stuck in my head all weekend .
"i usually only wear <UNK> on friday , but since friday was a workshop day i figured i was due ."
"ironically enough , on urllink npr this morning they were doing a story about urllink <UNK> ."
<#> . what 's your favorite animal ? cats .
<#> . what pets have you had in your lifetime ?
"several cats , a rabbit , <UNK> pigs , various fish , <UNK> , and dogs ."
is there any specific pet that you 've wanted but never had ?
"it goes with the whole "" living in an old farm house "" fantasy i have ."
do you have any ' pet ' pet <UNK> ( your pets or others ' ) ?
"i love our white lab - mix , honey , with all my heart but there is white dog hair on the sofa , the <UNK> floors , everywhere ."
i also do n't like dogs that jump up on people ( and our <UNK> does that so who am i to talk ... ) .
ex - <UNK> - ed . which led me to this ...
"ah , the good ol ' days ... remember in the days before cable tv and <UNK> ( can you remember that far back ?"
"we only had like <#> or <#> channels so if you wanted to watch tv , you watched what was on ."
"because of this , i remember watching a large number of <UNK> movies ."
i 'm so tired this week that i 've had fantasies about <UNK> that watch .
i 'd stop time ( for everyone else -- not me ) and spend a good straight <#> hours sleeping .
is it sad how much of my life is influenced by bad tv ?
what every teacher <UNK> hearing as conference week <UNK> its end ...
"student : * long pause while waiting for me to look up * me : yes , i 'm listening ... student"
: my mom wants to know when her conference time is .
"oh , well , she wants you to call her then ."
what 's happened here is <#> of <#> things .
have i mentioned that i really hate conference week ?
my husband and i have this on - going argument about what would be the best super power to have .
he has always maintained that instant transport would be the best .
i have to agree that instant transport would be really great .
"you could instantly transport yourself to a cafe in paris , wander around the city and then transport home for a good night 's sleep and a shower ."
"now , if my husband and i could work together with these <#> powers ( like the wonder twins ) imagine the possibilities !"
"in order to <UNK> our working parents , we stay late <#> nights this week ."
which is fine as long as parents show up .
so i 'm fairly happy but completely exhausted .
how do people work <#> hour days day after day after day .
i would be wiped out and unable to think after about <#> weeks .
some kid 's <UNK> is likely to die somewhere in the whole process and then it just gets sad .
"so far , however , we have <#> <UNK> all still living ."
"today , the kids handle them for the second time ."
i 'll keep you updated on there survival rate ...
"throwing up and ... uh , other <UNK> <UNK> sick ."
this is the first time he has been really sick since he was born .
in fact he 's been tearing around the house with his little cart as usual .
"other than taking care of the baby , i 've been really boring this week ."
"get up , go to work , come home , go to bed , repeat boring ."
"since we were actually back on our regular schedule for the first time since february , work has been really busy too ."
i 've been trying to get the kids settled down and back into the routine .
"they have actually been great ( although since i took <#> days off , we 'll <UNK> have to start that process all over again on monday .... )"
so that 's the end of my excuses .
"ok , must go to bed , get rid of this headache and hopefully become <UNK> tomorrow ."
"so , my weekend was basically spent recovering from my week ."
"baby boy did n't sleep through the night on wednesday , thursday , or friday so by saturday i was so sleep deprived , i was <UNK> on tears ."
( it 's <#> of our favorite show .
it was n't until we were on our way to my parents house for my ( <UNK> ) birthday dinner that i even realized it was st .
"in my other , younger , non - mom life this <UNK> would have been <UNK> ."
"c'mon , i 'm half irish and my name is erin for god 's sake ( which was always good for a free beer in the old days ) ."
the baby is pushing his cart at <UNK> speed all over the downstairs until bill comes down to get something and then goes back upstairs .
"the baby , <UNK> to me , decides to follow dad upstairs ."
"i do n't realize this until bill says , """
i go and get the little tyke and am about to move <#> of the baby gates blocking the living room to the bottom of the stairs .
"bill , who is in the process of <UNK> the garbage cans , tells me no , no , no ."
"besides , says my husband , he is right there watching the little guy ."
"ok , ok , i 'll stop the <UNK> mom bit but i remind my husband to stay right behind him so he can catch him if he falls ."
bill had reached down and was able to slow his progress by catching his shirt but could n't hold on .
i <UNK> him up after only <#> or <#> stairs and he was n't hurt but was really scared .
"showing remarkable <UNK> , i thought , i did not say "" i told you so "" to my husband ."
he was a little freaked out and i thought that got my point across .
"i comment back that after he fell down on his baby watching <UNK> in a big way that day , maybe he should n't talk ."
"he then has the nerve to say to me "" i was n't watching the baby , you were ."
"i explained to him that he had said he would watch the baby , that i was downstairs and he was upstairs with the baby ."
he honestly did not seem to get it .
he probably has just shy of a genius iq . but
nothing i said could convince him that he was in charge of the baby at that time .
"i watched the awards last night ( like everyone else , apparently ) and thought they were just ok ."
was it just me or was <UNK> not very funny ?
now he has an ear infection so i 'll be taking another day off work to stay home with him tomorrow .
i think his <UNK> was a little pissed that i dropped him off today .
but i really did n't think he was that sick this morning .
i now know that because of my husband . until i met him
", i would never have watched a game on tv much less gone to <#> in person ."
"but my husband 's family is a big baseball family , and i do n't just mean big fans ."
bill 's dad played for the washington <UNK> and when the team moved to texas he moved right along with them and went into the management end of things .
i can keep score and do it better than anyone else in his family ( they never keep track of balls and strikes ) .
this week has been <UNK> than most ( and for an elementary school teacher that 's saying something ! ) .
"we performed out "" tall tales and heroes "" musical <UNK> last night and it was great ..."
"well , good ... ok , it was cute in that little kid performance way ."
"like most things in elementary school , we were at the mercy of the parents ."
"about a third of our chorus did n't show , as well as <#> - <#> speaking parts that had to be re - cast last minute ."
but it 's done and next week is spring break so enough about that !
<#> of the best things about teaching is the time off .
"i love spring break , christmas break , summer break , mid - winter break and all the <UNK> federal holidays that we get off ."
<#> of the worst things about teaching is the fact that you do n't make enough money to go anywhere or do anything on all these breaks .
so i 'll be spending spring break at home with the baby and dogs ( my husband was off this week ) .
i plan on sleeping in as long as the baby will let me and maybe getting a little reading done .
"clean out <UNK> and stuff at home , get caught up on <UNK> and planning at school ."
"however , i 'm a <UNK> and i will be lucky to get the <UNK> swept off the floor before the are <UNK> this week ."
"for the second time in a little over a year , i was alone at my house yesterday ."
the husband took the baby and the dogs to the grandparents house and i was <UNK> alone .
"you need to understand that i love the above mentioned husband , baby and even dogs ."
"however , i have always been a person who needs more alone time than most ."
"in fact when my husband and i were dating , wednesday was "" alone night "" ."
we would stay at our seperate apartments by ourselves .
in the space of <#> afternoon i was able to : <UNK> a trip to old navy to purchase some new spring clothes .
<UNK> by target to pick up some shoes to go with said clothes .
"<UNK> the entire house , including the master bathroom ( including the gross shower floor ) ."
"<UNK> dinner , eat dinner and clean up from dinner in a consecutive fashion ."
"<UNK> "" the big chill "" on <UNK> ( favorite line : "" nobody ever said it was going to be fun ."
"at least , nobody ever said it to me ... "" ) amazing what i can accomplish when my attention is not split in <#> different directions at once ."
"so , i have n't been very good about writing lately ."
this is not the best time of year for teachers .
", i did n't get anything accomplished over spring break like i had planned ."
my parents bought us a computer ( it 's a long story )
"okay , i 'm feeling a lot less bitchy right now ."
"well , pop goddess britney spears is in town tonight ... shaking her <UNK> and <UNK> rack around the stage ."
"is she just a giant <UNK> , or is there some <UNK> quality that i am missing completely ?"
"a friend of mine called yesterday ... yesterday , people .... wanting <UNK> to miss brit 's sold - out show ."
"nothing like waiting til the very last minute . """
"oh , i 'll just call todd and get <UNK> thru him . """
"granted , i am a <UNK> worker when it comes to scoring <UNK> ."
i have connections all over the place ... and probably ( if i really wanted to ) i could get her the <UNK> .
"but , right now , i am feeling a little cranky ."
they keep trying to trick us into <UNK> our time .
"okay , let me back up ... my work is having a big community open house on sunday , september <#> ."
the committee ( think : high school <UNK> or <UNK> squad idiots ) keeps sending emails to the entire staff ... reminding us daily of the event .
<UNK> walking into work <#> day and you see post - it notes everywhere .
hundreds upon hundreds of post - it notes all over the offices and entire office building - each with quasi - cute remarks about the event .
somebody has a little too much time on their hands .
"anyway , all of this "" <UNK> rally "" mentality is taking it 's toll ."
"so , it must be true that everyone hates <UNK> ."
no <#> wants to be caught dead following the <UNK> parade .
there 's been a water main break here in downtown !
thousands of <UNK> of water <UNK> every second from the middle of the street .
"they have already <UNK> the hotel across the street , and thousands of office workers are trapped in their buildings ."
"ahhh , the end of summer in the city ."
"all of the kids are back in school , and there seems to be a new sense of routine and <UNK> ."
"it 's like everything received a fresh coat of paint , and that "" new car smell "" still <UNK> ."
"i look at school buses and laugh - i remember feeling stuck , like i 'd never get out of there ."
"the greatest day , perhaps , was the moment after my high school graduation , when all strings were officially <UNK> ."
no <#> could hold anything over me anymore - especially delicious was the fact that no <#> ever caught me when i <UNK> a report card in 7th grade .
"to this day , my <UNK> grades stand on my record ."
i never told anyone about it until i had my degree from the university .
then i told my parents ( who thought the whole thing was a riot ) .
"anyway , i kind of like that <UNK> has returned to my <UNK> neighborhood ."
"things quiet down now around <#> or <#> in the evening , as opposed to <#> or <#> ."
"plus , i like that first beautiful week when everyone has clean , new shoes ."
"devoted <#> hours in the early part of the day to the mundane , the routine ... the office ."
"as if i had no other plans later in the day , i arrived at work to <UNK> up some of those obnoxious "" loose ends . """
"they are not really loose ends , of course , but the stupid details <#> deals with daily ."
"they become "" loose "" when <#> goes on an extended visit elsewhere ."
"weather in cleveland : sunny , mid - <UNK> , humid .... delightful flying weather , right ? !"
"my cab driver spoke of "" slapping his bitch "" , smoking weed and being his own boss ."
i did manage to arrive on schedule and intact .
"steve managed to miss his flight - or should i say , our flight ."
i had specifically <UNK> my flight schedule to fly with him on his first business trip for the company .
"however , sitting at the airport , i realized that i would be traveling to nyc alone , as we <UNK> the plane with no steve in sight ."
"i got to new york without a <UNK> , checked - in at the hotel and took a stroll thru manhattan ."
note to self : do not bitch - slap laura m.
"after a full day of <UNK> labor , i have yet another meeting to go to ... <#> that will surely <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> ."
i have no hope of emerging from this <UNK> with any feeling in my limbs .
"basically , we 're dealing with a mountain of legal <UNK> - <UNK> and <UNK> - <UNK> ."
"i ca n't stand the stuff , but i guess it helps the world go ' round ."
"however , other david is doing a little <UNK> work for me ."
"hopefully , it will return some sort of result ."
"in other news , my dear friend <UNK> is still in mexico , <UNK> it up with some hottie , no doubt ."
"either that , or completely <UNK> and baking on the beach ."
i <UNK> my friend <UNK> in the uk today .
"the tao of steve was quite an engaging , entertaining film !"
"for those who may not know , it is a comedy about applying <UNK> principles to <UNK> - up ... and the <UNK> chaos it causes ."
"at <#> point it mentions that love is the national religion of the usa ... pretty accurate , do n't you think ?"
"maybe , it 's just the pursuit of love that 's the <UNK> ."
"well , let me clarify : i was not hunting for <UNK> ."
"i was hunting for mystery david , actually , his friend marc ."
"however , marc was not at his <UNK> shop ... as he was attending some big <UNK> show somewhere down the <UNK> ."
"so , i got absolutely no new <UNK> on my mystery man ."
"i 'm starting to forget what he looks like ... it 's getting fuzzy . then , as you know , i attended a little block party last evening ."
it was a fairly delightful party ... especially when dr .
", he gave me a hard time - i think it 's his hobby now ."
we sat together at dinner - amazing since my friend larry was <UNK> a cock - block ( <UNK> with tom ) .
"so , i was less than pleased with that ... but then i decided i just do n't give a fuck anymore ."
"whatever happens happens , right ? who needs to dedicate that kind of energy worrying about it ?"
i did drag my ass to church this morning .
"he 's incentive enough to keep going ... outside of the fact , of course , that i have many friends who attend regularly ."
i am going to go see the film the tao of steve later this afternoon .
"today started , really , at 12:30 am when i called his <UNK> at the hotel ."
"i had to leave a message saying goodbye and saying how sorry i was to miss him , but i had to get some sleep ."
"of course i was , who would n't be in bed at <UNK> in the morning ?"
"and , as if we were following some <UNK> written script , we said goodbye , <UNK> ."
"when i woke for good at <UNK> , i <UNK> for work ."
"what i thought about mostly , was the <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> of my morning ritual and the routine of my work day ."
"but most of all , i would be safe from matters of the heart ."
"once , when the pace slowed , i decided to call him at the hotel ."
i remember my heart <UNK> as i punched the numbers in on my telephone . where may i direct your call ? the hotel <UNK> asked <UNK> .
the bass in his voice <UNK> by sleep .
"i just wanted to say goodbye <#> more time , i said ."
my favorite tie is owned by the evil and <UNK> <UNK> known as <UNK> .
the tie itself is spectacular : a deep <UNK> purple with <UNK> of blue and green .
"it is quite spectacular , but he wo n't let me have it ."
he wears nothing but <UNK> <UNK> and oddly colored <UNK> that mostly do n't match .
"the tie of my dreams hangs in his walk - in , next to <#> other ties he does n't wear ."
the <UNK> happiness of my life if i owned this brilliant tie .
"so , until i decide what i 'm doing about the world 's best tie , i am not going to wear any of mine ."
i 'll leave them in a <UNK> on the floor of my closet .
no tie - <UNK> until i get <UNK> 's <UNK> tie .
watching the world go by on bridge avenue in the late summer afternoon .
"just last week , we saw the fire department take a wrong turn on the way to a fire ."
"they <UNK> back and , evidently , found their target : a warehouse <UNK> black smoke a few blocks away ."
kim and i are going to sit on the porch today : drinking beer and discussing cute guys .
"we 're hoping some of those hottie <UNK> might stop by - hey , i have matches ..."
"i know how to use them . with my luck , i 'd get the ugly <UNK> division ."
i have a friend 's birthday dinner to attend to this evening .
"tomorrow , we 're having some sort of block party with all of the neighbors on the street ."
"today is <UNK> 's birthday , so i want to say happy birthday and hello to my best friend in the uk ."
blast can be seen on <UNK> this month ... check it .
i 'm not feeling like writing a lot right now .
i 'll add more when i feel like it . hello again .
i was trying to find someone - anyone - who knows anything at all about dream analysis .
what about that aircraft <UNK> in the middle of the small lake ?
anyway ... i'm still waiting on the analysis portion of the dream .
i 'll share all the details just as soon as they 're avail .
i have to go and check it out for work .
i wonder if my <UNK> <UNK> will work in that area code ?
"last night , i went to see the <UNK> <UNK> documentary at our local art theatre ."
it 's <UNK> by <UNK> ... yet another cool feature .
"trust me , it 's worth whatever they 're charging ."
""" curse you , <UNK> girls ! "" - <UNK> <UNK>"
we launched into the sky and then <UNK> around waving at military personnel until we landed safely on an aircraft <UNK> sitting in the middle of a small lake .
"this whole month so far , i 've been meeting people ."
"it started out with jim , who i met on a sunday a few weeks ago ."
"there was this wonderful energy , vibe , you know ... the "" click "" that happens when you really dig someone and they dig you back ."
the vibe was totally <UNK> ' between the <#> of us .
"well , he travels a lot and so i did n't hold out a ton of hope ... but enough to make myself frustrated ."
"it was <UNK> , but had all the <UNK> info on it : the digits and the email ."
that 's when we pick up yesterday 's rocky horror story .
"no call from mystery david , and not a <UNK> from cutie dr ."
i keep meeting all these great guys who clearly have some sort of interest and then nothing ! ! !
i guess there 's nothing more to do but wait .
i spend the whole of yesterday afternoon and evening on my front porch with friends drinking rolling rock and telling stories .
"kim , kelly and i had caught a wonderful buzz by 5:30 when our across - the - street neighbor popped over ."
dr . tom is a professor of psychology ... so he 's always a blast .
"we all hung out until <#> or so , when we needed to <UNK> for food ."
there was a vibe <UNK> between me and dr .
i probably have been <UNK> in not telling you my other adventures recently .
"last week , i went to see my friend kim in a production of the rocky horror show ."
"she played the <UNK> that gets to sing "" science fiction double feature ."
"so , after <UNK> , i return to my seat , and this total hottie has taken the seat next to me ."
he is talking to <UNK> and does n't look like he 's gonna move .
... we make eyes ... we giggle and smile .
"at the end of the show , he <UNK> himself as david and <UNK> whether i might be going out after the show ."
i tell him i am meeting my friends in the cast .
"of course , i am fresh outta business cards or any <UNK> of anything with contact info on it ... frustrating ! ! !"
they decide that they 're not going out after all .
"so , david tells me he has to take his friends home , because he drove them ."
i tell him how wonderful it was meeting him .
he says he 'll get in touch with me thru a mutual <UNK> ...
i tell him that wo n't work because said person does n't know my last name .
i was certain i would have heard from him by now .
so ... there you have my random rocky horror <UNK> .
i was completely <UNK> ... which does n't happen often .
sometimes i hate this internet connection ... a <UNK> line that <UNK> like a <#> year old .
i am going to boston next week to check out this new show from london ... it 's called blast !
"okay , well i managed to sleep well ... finally !"
i see they have n't made too much progress on that <UNK> thingy .
"so , who watched the <UNK> : the series <UNK> ?"
<UNK> out over <UNK> to see all the teen girly hands raised : : : i only got to see part of the end of the episode .
"i <UNK> the making the video for "" the hardest part of breaking up ( is getting back your stuff ) ."
""" no <#> <UNK> the <UNK> phenomenon better than the people who created <UNK> ! !"
i am beginning to wonder about the full moon .
"i 'm not sleeping well , i 'm <UNK> , i 'm in a crappy mood all day ... nothing seems interesting or fun ."
"so , i am determined to get thru it as <UNK> as possible !"
is anyone doing anything to get them outta there ?
seems a lot of russian officials are doing a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> on the whole thing .... meanwhile i 'm sure the u.s . and
other countries could have been <UNK> at this point .
"by the time russia agrees to let other nations help , there will be no oxygen left ."

"no , that 's normal between clients , right ?"
i want him more than life itself and i do n't even know why .

"on sunday , we started making the dough ."
"mom pointed out the <UNK> on her counter , and took the <UNK> off of the <#> that contained flour and sugar ."
i measured everything out and mixed it up .
"this time , there was plenty of liquid in the dough ."
"in fact , this time there was too much liquid in the dough ."
the dough was about as liquid as very thin <UNK> <UNK> .
"and , as a bonus , it had a couple of worms in it ."
we added <UNK> and <UNK> to the dough .
then we baked it and put it in the backyard for the birds to eat .
it 's worth <UNK> that we did realize what had happened with this third batch was not the recipe 's fault .
"that did n't stop me from <UNK> <#> cups of it out and pouring it into the mixing bowl , though ."
"if you would be willing to help me figure out how to add comments to this blog , would you urllink email me and let me know that ?"
"i 'm getting married in <#> days , but i am only freaking out about it some of the time ."
today 's wedding - related purchase : a urllink guest book <UNK> .
"i 'm not upset , i do n't feel bad , i just ca n't focus on anything for more than a few minutes ."
is this just how it 's going to be for the next <#> and a half weeks ?
( did i mention <UNK> 's sister stephanie arrives here in chicago - to stay with us - the monday before the wedding ?
i figure that means there 's now less than <#> weeks before the <UNK> begin .
"when i was about <#> and a half years old , bruises started appearing all over my body ."
i ended up spending a few days in the hospital .
the doctors there figured out that my body was destroying all of the <UNK> in my blood .
they made it stop by giving me shots of <UNK> .
"i got a shot every hour , on the hour , for <#> days or so ."
"it turns out that when you are between <#> and <#> years old , your body is putting together the materials to make your adult teeth ."
it also turns out that <UNK> have a bad effect on the body 's efforts to make <UNK> .
"if this happens , the surface of your teeth will be pretty ugly ."
i hit my front <#> top teeth on the side of the pool .
the inner corners of the <#> teeth <UNK> into the water at the pool 's edge .
"immediately , an image of myself , a <UNK> , with teeth that looked like they belonged on hee <UNK> , flashed through my head ."
he decided to cover up the front <#> top teeth .
"ever since then , my front top <#> teeth have been , off and on , covered up with either <UNK> or bonding ."
"they are also relatively <UNK> , compared to permanent <UNK> or caps ."
my teeth have been looking pretty crappy for awhile now .
"here 's what they looked like last friday , in various stages of <UNK>"
i 've been putting it off ever since .
"then a few months ago , my friend allen told me that i should just get my teeth fixed , before the wedding ."
"he would loan me the money , and i could pay him back when i had it ."
"( allen is pretty cool , and pretty generous , too ."
i got an appointment for the friday <#> weeks and <#> day before the wedding .
"i have an <UNK> dental insurance plan , and i 'd chosen a dental office that was close to home ."
it did not occur to me that <UNK> dental was the <UNK> .
( the smiling <UNK> from the portrait studio were up on the same wall next to the smiling <UNK> from the dental office . )
"it turned out to be the best dental experience i have ever had , at least in my adult life ."
"the dentist was a woman in her <#> 's , friendly , calm , eager to help me out ."
"i told her i had <#> weeks until my wedding , and so i was throwing myself on her mercy ."
"if she had time to fix my teeth , i would be grateful , and if she did n't , i would understand ."
""" you have <#> weeks until your wedding ? "" she said ."
""" well , we will just make sure it happens ."
"if you have the time to come in , i will make the time to do the work . """
"after that , she <UNK> went over and checked my insurance plan to see how much it would cost me to fix my teeth ."
""" i think we should cover the top <#> front teeth , "" she said ."
$ <#> per tooth for the <#> teeth behind those .
it would take about a half an hour .
"so last friday i went to the dentist to have my teeth fixed , and a few hours later i left with my teeth looking something like this :"
did you forget how bad they looked before ?
"( no , not those , the ones above ! )"
"and you ca n't see it there , but she actually fixed the top ten teeth and only charged me for the top <#> ."
i got in to work today to find a voice mail from urllink <UNK> .
( you can read about <UNK> in that entry from a year and a half ago .
<UNK> is an attorney who used to be a partner at the law firm where i worked after my second year of law school .
"<UNK> opened his own office about a year and a half ago , and is apparently doing very well . )"
""" hi , jessie , this is <UNK> ."
"i 'm wondering if you would be interested in ... making a change . and if not , well , maybe we can just get together for lunch . """
i am excited and afraid to be excited at the same time .
this is the third time ( in <#> years ) that <UNK> and i have talked about me working for him .
"each of the other times ( like this time ) , i was amazed at his good timing ."
i felt like something great had just fallen into my lap .
and then it turned out that nothing had fallen into my lap at all .
so i 'm trying not to get my hopes up too much .
"in my <UNK> to him ( in response to his message from friday , i left a <UNK>"
", then he left <#> , then i finally got him in person )"
", i tried to convey "" eager but not needy , "" but maybe it does n't matter too much ."
"( i also miss going to court , but i try not to even focus on that . )"
<UNK> and i are having lunch this friday at 12:30 .
"it is all perfect , in a way , even when it 's insanely not perfect and out of control ."
"my friends are amazing , wonderful , sweet , generous people ."
"most of my family is that way , too ."
i 'll save up pictures and stories for you !
"i felt horrible and <UNK> , and when i talked to <UNK> i was <UNK> and grumpy ."
"thank you for marrying me , "" he said ."
how could i not ? ) and that was the end of the <UNK> .
"i was just me again , a little <UNK> and a little more tired , but without the <UNK> that had been with me earlier in the day ."
"i think the red lobster trip was a success , if not <#> that will be repeated any time soon . )"
i am so glad to have him here . and
"( "" ooh , <UNK> 's ! "" "" target ! ! ! """
""" <UNK> , i think i 've heard of that ! """
""" what about <UNK> <UNK> , do you have that ? "" )"
"we got home , and it was the same way ."
"she said she had cried when she wrote it , and i started to cry reading it ."
i stretched out and <UNK> down under the covers .
""" yeah , it feels good having them here , "" <UNK> said ."
we had only <#> session that lasted between 10:00 am and lunch .
we started by working on the <UNK> - <UNK> again .
"after working on the <UNK> - <UNK> , we did <#> sets back to back ."
after the break we had joan and lee show us how their <UNK> - <UNK> had improved .
both were up front for several minutes <UNK> what they had learnt .
we took a group photo and lee presented joe with a red envelope on behalf of the students .
joe said that he will give the contents of the envelope to the feed the homeless charity on <UNK> street in toronto .
we ended with another great meal prepared by virginia <UNK> .
the food alone was a reason to be here .
"we started by doing some dan - <UNK> , a set , more dan - <UNK> and another set ."
we then took a very deserved tea break .
after chilling and talking for a while it was time for more work .
like yesterday we worked on the <UNK> - yu .
it was <UNK> than yesterday but my <UNK> - yu will be awkward for weeks after this .
"when we finished , it was time to set up for lunch ."
we did a new <UNK> we had n't done yesterday sitting on the chairs we used for the set .
then we repeated <#> of the <UNK> from yesterday .
"forgive me but i forget the names , they do n't roll right off your tongue ."
now we are on an extended tea break .
after the break we practiced push hands for some time trying to <UNK> the new <UNK> - yu into the push hands .
joe talked about letting the bones do the work and not <UNK> through .
"dinner break we started with a set , of course ."
"we then worked on <#> moves , <UNK> flying and pat horse ."
<UNK> flying was pretty much what i am used to .
the pat horse <UNK> the <UNK> - yu we have been working on .
we ended with a sitting meditation led by mary lou .
afterwards some of us went to a coffee shop to relax and <UNK> .
"i am in <UNK> for the memorial day tai chi workshop , i flew in on friday ."
we did a couple of sets and then joe started us working on <UNK> - <UNK> .
we worked on through till lunch at 1:00 pm .
"the lunch fare was great , prepared by virginia <UNK> , and after a nice workout it hit the spot just right ."
we did another set and then <UNK> for <#> minutes or so .
"we looked at various ways of doing snakes ( and you though there was only <#> way , hah ! ) ."
"joe , the instructor showed us a way of sitting that helps you stretch your legs and make them more flexible ."
by then it was time to practice more <UNK> - <UNK> .
by 6:00 pm it was dinner time and we set up the tables for dinner .
dinner was just as good as lunch if not better .
"dinner break <#> of the members who is a musician , brought out a <UNK> , a <#> string instrument ."
he played several pieces for us until it was time to work again .
a little after 8:00 or 9:00 pm we did a set .
mary lou then taught us some sitting <UNK> meditation .
to end the night the students who attended the sword workshop <UNK> the sword set .
"i promise i will not bite anyone ( not hard , at least ) if you make a post or a comment ."
"if you have questions about posting or if you have any difficulties , i 'll gladly help you out ."
this is the group 's blog and it is n't supposed to be a <UNK> by your 's truly .
do n't think that your post has to be profound .
you could ask a question or for an explanation or anything you may think of .
you can pass on news about a friend we have not seen in a while or tell us about an upcoming event .
you can even post a joke or something funny .
"please do n't be shy , you are all welcome to participate !"
"if you all do n't start posting soon , i am going to make you do dan - <UNK> ! :)"
"please note that there will be no tai chi classes on monday , may <UNK> due to the observation of the memorial day holiday ."
"in the meantime , do n't forget to practice at home ."
"<UNK> class randy <UNK> carry tiger to mountain , <UNK> single whip , fist under elbow and go back to ward off monkey ."
"he taught go back to ward off monkey , <UNK> flying and step up and raise hands ."
continuing class we <UNK> up with the <UNK> and we started to work on wave hands like clouds right away .
"after a few rows of that , randy had us do a set ."
"the year of the monkey t - shirts from victoria , canada ( the blue ones ) arrived friday afternoon ."
"since i will not be there on wednesday ; if there are any shirts that are not picked up , i 'll leave them with randy ."
i will not be able to attend wednesday 's class .
i have tickets for the producers in west palm beach that night .
"he taught the following moves , carry tiger to mountain , <UNK> single whip , fist under elbow and go back to ward off monkey ."
"continuing class we skipped <UNK> and we started with a set followed by a second , and hopefully slower set ."
we then did some dan - <UNK> before taking a short break .
after the break we practiced wave hands like clouds .
wednesday night is your last chance to place an order for the texas branch 's t - shirt ( the red <#> ) .
"if you are interested , bring a $ <#> check ( no cash please ) and fill in your info on the order form ( write clearly ) ."
<UNK> class randy <UNK> the brush knee sequence .
today he covered the moves up to the first cross hands .
after the set we did <#> dan - <UNK> and then we worked on wave hands like clouds for the remainder of the class .
"aside from stressing the <UNK> stand and sit , randy talked about the weight transfer ."
he talked about the right leg pushing until it was time to stand and pull the leg over .
i also found that the left arm helps me balance while <UNK> my weight .
i realized that i have <UNK> important to say today .
i just wanted to take up some band <UNK> .
"i 'm honored that you asked me here , <UNK> .... and glad to hear that your day turned out to be <UNK> ."
had a wonderful day in spite of my <UNK> hangover .
"grilled <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , fresh <UNK> , and bread ."
", i have had a very clear head all day ."
"well after reading <UNK> ' blog and being invited to join her , i thought i <UNK> start <#> of my own ."
"had a good night last night , at my freinds party ."
but today in the haze of <UNK> fog i find myself <UNK> or some things in my own head .
why have i chosen this particular uniform of acceptance .
i was talking with a <UNK> this <UNK> about the <UNK> i have <UNK> my life with .
"what 's up in your life , sugar <UNK> ?"
"workin on the bike , workin at the bar ?"
i made <#> dollars at a bar that was closed .
then he called me on sunday to open again .
"i am very happy today , i love <UNK> ."
i like leaving the bar with more money than i walked in with .
it felt good to be behind the bar finally .
i got alot of compliments on my work too .
"the best <#> was "" i like you behind the bar , the place feels good with you working """
i ' m training for a july <#> <UNK> .
"it will be a <#> yard swim , <#> mile bike ride and <#> mile run ."
<#> yard swim <#> minute <UNK> weight training : <#> hour <#> mile run : <#> min .
( best time ever ! ) <#> yard swim <#> min .
"i 'm alone in the office today , doing the last bit of packing ."
"once this is done , i 'll have saturday and sunday to relax a bit before getting on the plane monday at <#> pm ."
"i 'm really looking forward to some down time , i must say ."
the <UNK> are here today and it 's freaking me out .
"<#> days had been scheduled for this move , but it looks like they are nearly done ."
"tomorrow , the salvation army is coming to pick up the furniture , etc . that i 'm not taking ."
my sister karen and my nephew blake came to new york for a visit .
"it was the week - end after i got back from <UNK> , so i was pretty jet <UNK> and had lots of work to do ."
karen and blake dropped me off at the office after brunch ...
"blake , who is <#> , did n't want to leave ..."
"when they left , they went straight to <UNK> <UNK> to buy some <UNK> ."
karen took some great pictures of the view outside the windows of the <UNK> direct office .
not the same view i 'll have in urllink <UNK> ... urllink
"the <UNK> are coming on wednesday , but instead of packing i decided to post the pictures from my last trip to <UNK> ."
"about <#> weeks ago , there was a <UNK> team meeting in urllink <UNK> that jeremy ( who works with me on <UNK> ) and i attended ."
"urllink the next night , after the <UNK> meeting , everyone went to dinner ."
it ended up being quite a fun night .
thursday night was the big <UNK> going away party at the urllink screening room .
ray <UNK> of urllink <UNK> and urllink <UNK> wants church <UNK> to think more deeply about their online communications strategy .
a more <UNK> version of this call to action is available urllink in <UNK> format .
"it 's also a bit of a sales pitch for urllink <UNK> , but it serves as a good public service announcement to the online christian community as well ."
"having said that , however , i still think <UNK> falls short in his assessment of developing <UNK> in church media ."
he does n't go beyond the traditional thinking of many online christian <UNK> .
"<UNK> talks about developing <UNK> in web design and web communication , but this all still <UNK> that people will be looking for church websites ."
"from an <UNK> perspective , this is the traditional , "" build it and they will come "" passive approach ."
"link via urllink <UNK> , which features an urllink interview with <UNK> in the latest issue ."
"in his book urllink <UNK> <UNK> , bob <UNK> wrote about the need for christians to engage the culture rather than running away from it ."
"andy <UNK> , the creator of urllink g - force , a popular <UNK> plug - in for audio , is <#> such <UNK> lamb ."
"you probably have n't heard much about andy , but he 's been spreading salt and light in the dj , music and entertainment business with his fantastic products ."
now he makes g - force and other products available via urllink <UNK> .
": many people ask me how i came up with the name "" g - force "" for my visual <UNK> ."
"i respond that i 'm christian , and that the "" g "" is for god ."
"but do n't take my word for it -- form your opinion of christianity from the story of christ , not from hear - say or headlines ."
"if you wanted a <UNK> understanding of a movie , you would n't <UNK> critics or friends -- you 'd go see the movie for yourself ."
"i do n't deny that many that have claimed to be christian have done terrible things , but i offer that their christianity stopped at their claims ."
just because i claim that i 'm a girl scout and that i like to bite the heads off
"chickens does n't mean that i * am * a girl scout , nor does it mean that * real * girl <UNK> <UNK> chicken - head - biting ."
"it 's just that headlines like , "" girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> "" sell well on <UNK> ."
it 's maintained by an international and non - <UNK> christian organization called campus <UNK> for christ and has student chapters at most colleges and universities .
so there you have andy <UNK> 's approach to e - <UNK> .
"it 's nothing <UNK> or heavy - handed -- in fact , it is n't too easy to find andy 's bio from the recently <UNK> <UNK> site ."
"but it 's a <UNK> , honest approach to sharing the faith with hundreds of g - force and <UNK> fans ."
i 'm a big fan of g - force .
update : i 've removed the rss feed link until i can get the thing to work .
i think my rss feed is dying of <UNK> .
"none of the items posted on this blog are getting to the rss feed , for some reason ."
i 've contacted blogger support for some help but have n't heard back yet .
"leave a comment here , or email me at <UNK> at <UNK> dot com ."
"<UNK> blogger urllink todd hunter , voted by someone as urllink the worst blogger of <#> for his lack of blogging <UNK> , has found his way home ."
but he 's had a busy year on several <UNK> and should get an <UNK> absence from the <UNK> .
todd now leads urllink alpha usa and <UNK> some great ideas about making the christian faith relevant to the world .
"i met todd hunter at urllink search party <#> , during which time he shared some great stuff ."
i hope he 'll continue to share his thoughts on his new weblog . and
"for those interested about his plans for <UNK> , here 's an interview from urllink off the map ."
"new research from urllink the <UNK> group "" <UNK> how far adults are willing to <UNK> the christian faith into the nation ’s culture ."
""" the survey asked for opinions about <#> possible changes in u.s ."
i 'm not sure what to make of that .
"the idea of <UNK> an official faith in such a <UNK> culture bothers me , to say the least ."
"but once again , <UNK> has <UNK> some interesting angles about how we americans practice and think -- or do n't think -- about our faith ."
here 's urllink dean <UNK> ' list of recommended christian sites for the 11th - graders at his church .
and i feel bad when i expect the teens in my flock to learn a memory verse or <#> .
"once dean 's kids have absorbed everything at these sites , they ought to be ready to walk across the stage to get their <UNK> degrees ."
"also , gay males are more likely to express their homosexuality via their blogs than females ."
what does all this mean for those involved in online ministry ?
perhaps this study can help those of us who strive to reach young people better understand how they project themselves into this online realm .
"the author , david <UNK> of <UNK> university , posts the urllink complete research paper ( <UNK> ) online ."
getting saved has never been so easy ! a nice little <UNK> that should serve as a <UNK> tale about virtual <UNK> .
corporate giants are taking a cue from the bloggers among them and using <UNK> to <UNK> customer relationships .
"from the <UNK> blog , a related post on urllink why rss is relevant ."
( which reminds me : i need to set up an rss feed for this blog post <UNK> .

"that 's all the time you 've got , email writer , to grab my attention ."
"the coming generation of <UNK> will start out as bloggers , says urllink dan <UNK> ."
"they will be "" <UNK> in global - reach <UNK> , in flame wars and public <UNK> ."

"i posted about this last week on urllink <UNK> blog , and a few people found it worth discussing briefly in the comments section there ."
"but i thought a reader or <#> over here might find it worth pondering , too ."
"i have n't had a chance to sit in on urllink andrew jones ' latest project on virtual theology , but i hope to do so soon ."
"the online world provides <UNK> soil for a wide <UNK> of new religious movements , especially urllink <UNK> and neo - <UNK> beliefs ."
""" most of those efforts "" have focused on <UNK> <UNK> of a given group ’s doctrine as <UNK> in contrast to christian <UNK> ."
""" alas , far too often we attempt to <UNK> those same <UNK> efforts in the online mission field ."
"<UNK> 's excellent article , though a bit <UNK> , offers an alternative way of looking at ministry to those involved with new religions ."
"behold , all things e - <UNK> have become new ."
"after months of <UNK> as a <UNK> weblog , the e - <UNK> website has finally joined the ranks of real blogs ."
"now powered through the wonders of urllink blogger , this site will feature all the latest news and links <UNK> to the subject of online <UNK> ."
this new approach to personal publishing also will replace the urllink good news <UNK> newsletter that i published from <#> - <#> .

an aside to blogging <UNK> : please do n't judge the work by its obnoxious title .
as <UNK> explains in the introduction : i believe that our network of blogs <UNK> the reach of any single pastor .
"to be clear , no <#> thinks they are personally smarter or more “ called ” than any pastor ."
"however , as a network , we know more than our <UNK> ."
thousands of bloggers <UNK> established <UNK> and relate <UNK> with <#> another .

we earn the permission of people before we speak in to their lives .
this new way of <UNK> <UNK> out of christians using internet technology .
... this kind of <UNK> <UNK> means that i have a permission to interact with a person at the moment of their interest .
we have grown tired of <UNK> being the <UNK> of what is important .

we genuinely believe that we have more to offer than what the church is <UNK> to receive .

grace kelly <UNK> is the main character of a novel i 've been writing for the past <#> years .
"ok , only <#> of those i 've been actively working on it ."
but perhaps it could help me get them done .
we watched the last episode of angel on thursday night .
rich got me a <UNK> for mother 's day .
"i thought with angel , buffy and friends gone there would be nothing left to <UNK> ."
but we seem to have become obsessed with various <UNK> shows .
"it 's <UNK> "" designed to sell "" ( because we 're going to sell our condo in a year )"
""" this old house "" and "" dream house ."
""" we 're getting <UNK> up to do an addition at what is now our income property ."
"we 're also <UNK> <UNK> , family guy <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ."
the thing that makes me nuts about these <UNK> shows is the <UNK> .
they have at least <#> professional <UNK> and a designer thrown into a <UNK> budget .
the labor alone on some of these projects is a few <#> dollars ( at least in this area ) .
if you can get somebody good with the skills who is willing to work on a small job .
"but these people in "" designed to sell "" are so depressing ."
they live in these dated houses for decades without making changes .
we bought a house last year and found out that they had no electricity in their half bath .
there was no outlet and the overhead light was n't connected to anything .
to fix that and <#> others ( also disconnected ) was all of $ <#> .
how can you have no power in your bathroom ?
how do you read if you want to go at night ? and the <UNK> !
we take many <UNK> a year over to salvation army and good will .
both my parents <UNK> about backing a <UNK> up to the house and throwing out the other <#> 's stuff .
but neither is willing to part with their own stuff .
they move their stuff back and forth to their weekend place in plastic laundry <UNK> .
i think my husband has been a good influence on me in this respect .
it was my day off to play with the boy .
i met up with a friend of mine and we went to the park with the babies .
her son is a week younger than mine .
"a lot of "" <UNK> "" ( stay at home <UNK> tell me <UNK> how busy they are ."
( not the mom i was hanging out with today ) .
but a lot of them are really defensive to me about their choice .
i went back to work after a <#> week <UNK> leave .
i think staying at home with your baby is a lot more difficult than going to work and getting a break from your baby .
having a baby is like falling in that crazy falling - in - love that can be so unhealthy when you 're in you <#> 's .
"it 's that rush , but it has none of the dangerous elements to it ."
but hanging out with a baby day - in - day out is exhausting .
it 's much easier for me to go to work and use the grown up part of my brain .
"i do feel bad for women who leave jobs that they did n't like that much , especially if they are in their <#> 's ."
it must be tough to be at that point in your career and not have found a job or a career that you 're excited about .
"and i 'm talking about women who have had all the advantages , good education etc ."
"and after over <#> years in the workplace , they still do n't like what they 're doing ."
"in some ways , i wish i wanted to stay home with the boy , but i think i 'd really miss work ."
"plus , i work in it , so i 'd have to start over if i took a few years off ."
i feel very lucky that i even got to choose .
these days i feel lucky most of the time .
i wonder why america has this fear of aging .
"perhaps our bodies start to <UNK> us , but life keeps getting better ."
most of my friends have started to settle down with babies and partners as we start to swim into our mid <UNK> .
"some of them ended up with really horrible partners , but those are few and far between ."
"last night after the boy went to sleep , the husband was applying for new jobs on the internet ."
he said he 'd written an enthusiastic cover letter .
and on the spot we made up the worlds worst cover letter .
"it sounded <UNK> like this : dear sir , i really want to work as your company ."
last week we had company at our house and my wife made them dinner .
so i would have my wife make dinner for your company sometimes .
"sincerely , rich we went on and on ."
we laughed so hard we woke up the boy .
i feel slightly <UNK> that the seemingly female friendly curves is giving money to urllink <UNK> anti - abortion groups .
there could be so much common ground in the abortion debate .
"i think the pro - choice movement needs to be just that , about choice ."
if a woman gets pregnant under sub - ideal circumstances there is a lot of pressure to <UNK> the pregnancy .
"i think these groups could work in <UNK> to create resources for women who want to have ' <UNK> ' babies , but do n't know what to do ."
anti - abortion groups pour all their time and energy into preventing <UNK> and not enough time supporting the millions of unwanted children in the us .
let 's get that fixed and then we can talk about allowing more unwanted children into the world .
it 's completely <UNK> to think that people are n't going to have sex until they 're married .

be sure to check out the very good poem below
"urllink <UNK> : best sites for web design i 'm just going to start posting random stuff on this , like a blog ."
or maybe this should be my <UNK> blog .
"wanting this to be a <UNK> journal , maybe focusing on poetry ."
"talked to <UNK> today about using her photography , which is very good , and she will talk to <#> of her friends who may send me some poetry ."
"thought of a couple of names for paper version of this <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> , in the flat fields ."
i think i 'll do a poll on lj .
"email me <UNK> , poetry , and visual art for paper and <UNK> , <UNK> , to come out whenever i get enough quality work ."
"it 's all about time , and how much of it i have ."
you 'd think being unemployed would make it easier .
"i guess this , obviously , is the blog for <UNK> , not <UNK> itself ."
"anyway , i am going to put <UNK> onto my own web site , <UNK> , although i think blogger does show up in searches better ."
"actually , i think i approve of the way both parties are acting in this conflict ."

"robert , what 's going on in your head ?"

"then , he responded , ' for today , sir , that 's enough ' ."
"i then shoved him into an empty classroom and locked the door with <#> turns of the key . """
"soon after , <UNK> shot himself in the head as armed police closed in ."
"now if only i could get some comments ... guess i 'll have to post something , huh ? ! ? !"

ok ... something big and nasty happened to the old <UNK> sometime earlier today .
"the <UNK> comments feature has n't been working for a few days , so i went in and re - entered the <UNK> code from their website ."
the whole thing was g - o - n - e !
"to quote that great <UNK> , <UNK> from disney 's the jungle book , "" gone ... solid gone ! "" so i 'm re - doing it ."
"nothing in particular made it a tough , long day ."
i guess i 'm simply discovering that it 's going to be more of a spiritual battle than i imagined .
"i mean , after all , here we are in the very <UNK> of the bible belt !"
this is where the big guns come to hang out !
but the powers of darkness are there and here and everywhere !
the most powerful <#> may be that of <UNK> ...
it seems that everything i post is kind of a <UNK> .
a student in my class tonight commented on food <UNK> as a reason for the early development of girls in america .
she claimed that her <UNK> had told her that her own daughter ( age <#> ) probably developed early because of all the <UNK> food she ate .
"i really can not believe that <UNK> would have anything to do with early <UNK> production , but i did n't tell her so ."
"i have not yet mentioned the <UNK> class that i teach <#> <UNK> a <UNK> nutrition <#> , required for nursing students ."
"they study harder , make better grades , and contribute much more <UNK> to class discussion ."
"college , it could be <UNK> , it wasted on those who have just finished high school ."
"i had been to many art <UNK> at the time , but lacked the curiosity to study paintings closely for composition , <UNK> point , etc ."
when i was actually in front of famous paintings .
"in <UNK> i particularly enjoyed rachel 's discussion on <UNK> , the reason for the <#> sides , the meaning of the fantastic creatures amongst the religious elements ."
"ok , so i am going to have to invest in all of <UNK> 's cd 's , as i like the edge on her lyrics ."
"<UNK> may be too young for them , however ."
"speaking of too young , a friend commented yesterday about <UNK> 's <UNK> about she seems young to start developing and that we had better keep a careful eye ."
<UNK> about had a stroke thinking about the future ahead with our daughter .
my first thought was about the wisdom of letting a <#> year old out with anybody let alone a <#> year old .
"of course , i tell <UNK> that she wo n't be able to date until she has graduated from college and has a job ... ...."
i crashed your pickup truck and then i had to drive it back home
i was crying i was so scared of what you would do of what you would say
"i see that my blog name <UNK> in comparison to others , such as sticky hands , sticky arms ...."
i might just have to start reading that <#> .
yesterday i made a <#> mile <UNK> to the wine and beer store in <UNK> .
"frankly , i do n't see myself as mean enough to <UNK> an extra $ <#> ... maybe $ <#> on a really bad day ...."
"i am still upset about my church , and whether i see myself going there through <UNK> 's high school years let alone <UNK> 's ."
the possibility of switching churches comes to mind .
"i could not join that church in good faith , and they would certainly not want me ."
"if <UNK> wanted to go to their youth group on his own , that would be his decision ."
"i could see myself as an <UNK> , i suppose ."
i have frequently held in contempt those who switched from our church when they did n't like <UNK> .
i have attended this class for <#> <UNK> and enjoy many of the members .
it could be considered <#> of the social highlights of my week .
"lastly , i do not want to have to explain my switch because of the hard feelings that may arise ."
i could easily move myself over to the <UNK> church and sit with my mother in the <UNK> .
that way i would not have to discuss the youth issue at <UNK> i can just say that it was done for family unity .
"of course , <UNK> and <UNK> may not like their youth group , either ."
non - <UNK> of church is not an option .
"i feel that my children need the church <UNK> , to draw upon for strength and <UNK> in tough times ."
if this is a sign of a mean <UNK> .... ....
"mean <UNK> is in <UNK> <UNK> , and she has got it bad ."
"its all about church and the oldest 's graduation , and i ca n't see a good solution ."
the oldest refuses to be included in our church 's annual senior recognition sunday .
this goes beyond <UNK> rather to a feeling of <UNK> on his part to the church .
i did n't quite understand the extent of this <UNK> until youth sunday <UNK> when the youth group did the service .
"during <#> of the prayers , a junior at <UNK> actually prayed thanks to the best church and the best school system in the best town in america ."
"andrew quit going to sunday school years ago , and i suspect that <UNK> will do the same soon ."
"i do not blame andrew for not wanting to be associated with this crowd , at least not as much , after the service ."
"for starts , they did an ' <UNK> ' <UNK> which <UNK> on <UNK> with hands <UNK> similar to american deaf language but corny beyond words ."
it was a bit over the top in relation to my <UNK> level on public displays of religious <UNK> .
"on the other hand , andrew has attended this church since he was <#> years old , he was <UNK> there , and is a member ."
i am <UNK> that he feels no connection to people who have watched him grown up before their eyes .
"senior recognition <UNK> , like graduation <UNK> are not just for the people being honored ."
"they are for the parents , and others who have supported and <UNK> these <UNK> for all these years ."
to simply refuse to show up because you are shy or because you do n't feel connected is n't a good enough reason to not show up .
life is a <#> way relationship between you and those around you .
there are things you do to be part of a community .
to not show up <UNK> us all in the face .
the newest <UNK> for my mean <UNK> rule of blog <UNK> <UNK> around the inside knowledge <#> <UNK> from reading blogs .
so far neither of my boys have asked to have dates over while i am gone . .... .
and what was i going to do about it if i did n't approve .
"i added , just for kicks , that i also prefer that he drink decent beer , not that cheap <UNK> stuff they sell in <#> packs like pepsi ."
"well , i did n't say cheap <UNK> stuff , but i did make a comment about drinking decent beer ."
"i also said that i would rather him drink beer than whiskey or vodka , and that so far he had shown reasonable judgement in his partying ."
then i pointed out that her son must also be at these parties to know so much about my <UNK> ....
this part of mean <UNK> <UNK> is difficult . as a died in the wool liberal
", it is a tough call about <UNK> drinking , which can get people hurt or <UNK> , or worse ."
"on the other hand , i truly enjoyed drinking a beer or <#> with my <UNK> children in <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
my cousin <UNK> in <UNK> was thrilled that my children <UNK> the beers he bought for them and that both seemed to hold it well .
"ben franklin said it well , everything in <UNK> ."
".... i am working up a little dance routine to go along with this , i 'll keep ya posted"
"ok , so there are more concerts that i wish that i had seen , or at least parts of concerts ."
"i wish had seen led <UNK> singing <UNK> to heaven , <UNK> , the <UNK> , and misty mountain hop ."
i like the part about carrying pictures of chairman <UNK> ... even after <#> or more years .
"oh well when you are as old and mean as me , details get <UNK> along the way .... .... ...."
i envy <UNK> 's bob dylan 's concert tickets .
<UNK> and i had friends read the lyrics to forever young at our wedding .
i regret that i never saw <UNK> in concert .
so what concerts have i gotten to go to ?
".... there are more , but i ca n't recall them now ."
"<UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> were outstanding ."
i regret that i never saw them with neil young .
"my favorite song is <UNK> in the <UNK> the <#> way street version , of course ."
"i like the word <UNK> , by the way ."
i appreciate writers who use vivid <UNK> it is like having <UNK> 's word of the day on a larger scale .
i received your card and was glad to here from you .
"joe , i would like to come down to see you , but i <UNK> not ."
"from <UNK> card from <UNK> island , ca ; no date <UNK> wanda , we are all well ."
i am making <UNK> a dress and also baking bread .
i suppose you heard that albert 's brother was shot .
i had a card from lizzie and may this week .
"( send me a note . ) card from san gabriel mission , ca no date dear sister , how are you ."
"i thought you <UNK> invite me out to your house to eat , but no such luck ."
we hope anyway that you enjoy it and wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year .
the going rate for a plane ticket leaving <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> is $ <#> not including <UNK> it has to get much lower than this ... ....
"i guess she is proud of each and every pair of socks that she has made , but not inclined to share the actual pattern for said socks ."
it might even help my french to use a french - based pattern .
i am enjoying this ' <#> new blog a day ' thing .
i just went to wendy 's knitting <UNK> at <UNK> . yesterday
"she <UNK> and posted all of her sock yarn , and sometime last week she <UNK> <#> inch of a complicated sweater ."
i should go back and see if she has a decent <UNK> <UNK> i have some of my <UNK> 's yarn in a box in the back of my car
...... maybe i could just knit instead of blog .
i am delighted to discover who my oldest son has asked to the prom .
"i think she is a <UNK> <UNK> very extraordinary with regards to brains , personality , and <UNK> - de - <UNK> ."
i went to a ' recently ' edited blog called simply mama .
this mama did n't sound <UNK> just bored to tears watching <UNK> and <UNK> when she can not sleep .
i hope that i sound more mean than <UNK> ....
"because i am mean is the obvious answer , but not the truth ."
"i take this magazine in case i get a batch of lemon grass in my <UNK> , and in case i find myself on the <UNK> coast ."
i enjoyed reading <UNK> 's blog about <UNK> today .
i had considered going to <UNK> on my last <UNK> but deemed it too far .
i would have like <UNK> to have seen the fred and ginger house .
i would have liked to have heard <UNK> in a church setting .
<#> of these days i will make it there myself .
"i had someone comment recently that <UNK> must be a particularly <UNK> spouse , because i travel so much without him ."
"for <UNK> record , i have traveled <UNK> with my <UNK> to <#> states , and <#> foreign <UNK> some with our children and some with just ourselves ."
"big bend .... these days somebody has to stay with <UNK> , and <UNK> has n't seemed to hot on <UNK> trips to northern europe ."
"the last passage has made me <UNK> for my father , who traveled to all the states and <#> foreign countries ."
i miss him listing them all now that he is completely <UNK> .
every ounce of my being that aches for the open road comes from <UNK> <UNK> the man born to travel .
or <UNK> my dad planning his next trip .
i grew up with a next trip always at hand .
the stack of slides that is now in the <UNK> cabinet is of <UNK> i took them out to use the <UNK> for my own roots tour to europe .
"yesterday i put in <UNK> of <UNK> 's clothes , and neglected to check <UNK> pair of pants for <UNK> ."
<#> gap pair had <#> pens in a <UNK> which <UNK> the entire load .
"ok , so this planning for a potential trip this winter has jumped into <UNK> ....."
let me <UNK> what can i do today to make my children miserable . ....
i waited <#> minutes at <UNK> gardens yesterday for the <UNK> to get fixed so i could get the load of <UNK> that i paid for .
"i would not have bought <UNK> ....... the load only got to the middle bed , and only part of that ."
it will surely take another <#> - <#> loads to finish up .
<UNK> ..... andrew asked at supper what <UNK> is made from .
"he said that the most expensive <UNK> would be made from boards pulled out of historic homes , like mt <UNK> ."
i would prefer to <UNK> with ground up $ <#> bills .
my first rose is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has <#> tiny <UNK> noticed on <UNK> .
the bride is probably <#> of the <UNK> ...... several have commented about our rule for smoking outside rather than inside .
"somehow , a <UNK> shower in a smoke filled room seems <UNK> even for this part of the country ."
at least the <UNK> at each <UNK> were n't packs of <UNK> lights ... ....
"on public radio the other night as i drove home from work , there was a group of buddhist <UNK> doing <UNK> <UNK> that sounded especially <UNK> and/or <UNK> ."
the <UNK> wanted to review how these <UNK> play into the buddhist religion .
"the lead monk <UNK> the <UNK> of their <UNK> <UNK> of thought , search for truth , achievement of righteous emptiness ."
i am still worried over the emptiness <UNK> i spend my days trying to <UNK> <UNK> i see nothing righteous about emptiness .
"clearly , i am not cut out of the same cloth as the <UNK> ."
"with the senate in control of the senate , w will have a hard time getting through a candidate that is too right wing ....."
"at least i hope that is the case . .... on the way to work , npr ran a story about the manhattan <UNK> project ."
volunteers planted them in as many <UNK> sections of the city ass they could <UNK> this week they are in <UNK> a city <UNK> .......
"maybe he <UNK> wants to see me cry , and maybe that s why i just wo n't ."
i have done some checking about my dream <UNK> to spain .
"ok , so i want to go everywhere in spain now that i borrowed a <UNK> spain book from the library ."
"we could land in <UNK> , see the <UNK> stuff then take the train to <UNK> to see the <UNK> stuff ."
on my way to work there is a house for <UNK> with <#> <UNK> .
"ah well , i am not interested enough to call the <UNK> and see for myself ."
my new profession is a lot of <UNK> work followed by <UNK> <UNK> .
i have got this notion that i want to fly to paris on <UNK> then take the <UNK> to <UNK> on <UNK> and then on to <UNK> .
<UNK> and the <UNK> have gotten into my mind and i ca n't get them out .
i want to ride the subway where the entrance looks like big steel worms .
i want to eat <UNK> and drink a nice red from <UNK> .
"of course , i know no spanish beyond <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"ok , so i ca n't spell <UNK> correctly ."
andrew appears to have <UNK> typing <UNK> he appears to be able to type faster than he can write .
"i took a summer typing course in high school , assuming that i would need to know how to type papers when i got to college ."
i seem to recall using a borrowed portable <UNK> in my dorm <UNK> maybe i still have it somewhere .
typing on a real keyboard is a greater challenge than a computer <UNK> it takes more pressure to <UNK> the keys .
my biggest mistakes were in the switching of <UNK> like <UNK> versus <UNK> i used up a lot of white out in the days before spell check .
"i have not seen all of the episodes , and feel a bit lost at some points when i ca n't quite follow the many plot lines ."
there are <#> ' hours ' to go and lots of explaining to do in this far - <UNK> tale .
happily i walked <#> minutes on the treadmill so the time was n't a total bust .

"my mother - in - law once told me this tale , then later <UNK> it , but i believe that it is true ."
who would make up this kind of stuff about your own mother if it did n't have truth to it ?
i believe that life begins somewhere between <UNK> and <UNK> when the <UNK> could live on its own if born at that moment .
"before <#> weeks , i believe that women have the right to choose whether to continue with this potential for life or to end it ."
<UNK> asked at supper if mean and <UNK> necessarily go together .
can <#> be a mean <UNK> and not be <UNK> ? is being <UNK> part and <UNK> of being a mean <UNK> ?
"he was not ' in <UNK> of the library ' , but in the baptist lot and i almost missed him as i drove by ."
a mean <UNK> would have <UNK> him on the road and let him find his own ride home .
i make no claims to understand car repair or emergency <UNK> he knew so before i came into town .
"if anything , he should have paid more attention when his dad has jumped his sorry car in the past .... ...."
"i missed my mother - in - law today , in an unexpected way ."
the phone rang about <UNK> while i was still enjoying a rare sunday afternoon nap .
"it 's kay , because kay always had a <UNK> for calling when i was asleep and there was no <#> but me to answer the phone . '"
' she would ask before she launched into pleasant conversation about all we were doing .
finally she would ask to talk to <UNK> who was probably out hiking with <UNK> and <UNK> which was why i got to nap in the first place .
"her death on <#> was no surprise , given the <UNK> in her feet we noticed over president 's day weekend and her severe <UNK> cough ."
<UNK> <UNK> cranky when there are not trips on the horizon .
there are n't even whole weekends off on the horizon .
i would like to be thinking about a trip this winter after christmas but with a child in college it may not be possible unless my <UNK> south number hits
mean <UNK> probably would n't buy you anything if they won . ....
something about people going to <UNK> for butter that was <#> cents a pound and <UNK> <UNK> apple and <UNK> slices on sticks for use by space <UNK> .
the sticks were too long and i had to snap off the ends in order to eat the <UNK> .
i find food dreams interesting rather than an annoying extension of my <UNK> .
the dreams that are annoying are the typing <UNK> where each word is <UNK> out slowly as in typing onto a <UNK> screen .
"i have had these dreams after intense <UNK> of typing , and find that this <UNK> of work from <UNK> to sleep time to be disturbing ."
"i take away <UNK> , telephone time , outside time and by god , i stick to it ."

"i was <UNK> this morning to my daughter , who left the house wearing shorts that are clearly too short and too small , and bright yellow socks ."
she said she was cold and i told her that if she felt warm enough to wear shorts she did n't need a coat .
"this child <UNK> <UNK> on appropriate <UNK> on matching , on clothing choice , etc ."
i fear that she will be a <UNK> do n't when these things begin to <UNK> say in middle school .
"of course , it will all be my fault when push comes to shove ...."
"i am reading a <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> , a poet and <UNK> called sleeping with cats ."
my husband <UNK> <UNK> but he could never fall asleep if <#> were even close to the bed .
men who actually sleep with women who sleep with cats are a rare breed .
<UNK> seems just fine sleeping with our precious cat - sometimes .
"the bathroom at work has an old copy of rolling stone behind the <UNK> a <UNK> copy , pre - <UNK> copy , pre - lady <UNK> copy ."
there is a <UNK> to joey <UNK> of the <UNK> i ca n't recall a single song by the <UNK> and do n't think i ever heard an album .
i know now that he was cutting edge in <#> when punk came along and that many groups borrowed from his <UNK> and his <UNK> .
if <UNK> was still alive i would download something .
i <UNK> the existence of my blog to both of my sons last night .
the middle child guessed the name mean <UNK> right <UNK> and challenged me to come up with an <UNK> child <UNK> and dance .
my older child thinks that blogging is stupid - why would you want to journal on - line ?
"frankly , this is private in the sense that i am not saying anything that i would mind others reading ."
"after poo - <UNK> my blog , my older child told me that he was watching a movie and that i was taking up his precious time ."
he had borrowed the original <UNK> from the library .
he knows that i really like the <UNK> ford <UNK> but closed the <UNK> instead .
i hope he remembers to take back the movie before e fine kicks in . ....
"my middle child has a <UNK> that he <UNK> from time to <UNK> mean <UNK> , mean <UNK> ."
".... there is a certain <UNK> to it that <UNK> description , and sometimes a little dance as well ."
i think that i will make up my own <UNK> and dance to be done in <UNK> with his performance .
i will ponder the details and get back to you tomorrow
"ok , so mean <UNK> takes <UNK> with the increasing number of spam emails in her junk mail box that must be erased on a daily basis ."
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the pitiful come on lines designed to <UNK> the <UNK> to open these messages .
"for the record , mean <UNK> <UNK> to use every <UNK> before she listed several days ago before moving on to something else . ...."
"ok , so i looked all day for an excuse to use the term ' in high <UNK> ' , it is so jane <UNK> ."
the sun thing is less important now that i have discovered that <UNK> <UNK> sells perfectly respectable sun in a squeeze bottle .
i do not have a new good book just now - but i am <UNK> some old good books that a friend returned to me <UNK>
i apologize to those in my family who were <UNK> accused of having said books .... )
the hours is being filmed with tom cruise 's ex wife whose name <UNK> me as the star .
"i have only made a few mistakes with reading books <UNK> on npr , by the way ."
"adults should be issued summer reading lists just to keep them up to <UNK> on what is out there worth reading ....... no tests , please ."
"ok , so mean <UNK> regrets using the term ' pissed off ' in yesterday 's blog ."
<UNK> and i really did enjoy the baseball game last evening in <UNK> .
"i could have done without the dancing girls , the loud musical <UNK> ( hit me with your best shot ."
.... ) and the constant commercials just below the big screen for <UNK> .
"but this is america , and this is the stuff we do best . ...."
"<UNK> loves baseball , and his favorite memories of youth involve little league ."
.... i am <UNK> about the <UNK> but look forward to seeing the new stadium and being with my beloved .
"i would much rather be with all of my <UNK> , sitting in a <UNK> baseball park , under the <UNK> ...."
"i knew deep down that a committed <UNK> such as yourself would n't just stop , but i was worried , for a minute ... ...."
"ok , so i voted this morning on the way to work ."
"though voting for president was important , this election is everything <UNK> people that can make or break things on a close - to - home level ."
i am ashamed that so few of my friends and neighbors appear to have bothered to come on in and vote .
i am also somewhat taken <UNK> that so many people want to be <UNK> you would think that it was high pay and even higher <UNK> .
happily we have had no <UNK> or <UNK> or the like tied to our <UNK> 's race .
or <UNK> videos in <UNK> commercials for that matter .
i can not vote for mayor or city <UNK> i would have preferred that ballot sheet .
"i am not saying who ( whom ? ) i would prefer for those <UNK> , but i do have my hopes . ...."
"ok , so today is memorial day and i have the entire day off ."
it will be strange to go to <UNK> and not be able to drop by and see <UNK> 's mom or dad .
"i believe that lisa has just sold their place in <UNK> , and that the will is in <UNK> ."
i still find it hard to accept that <UNK> lost both his parents within the last <UNK> both .
"and when they were all gone , she died before she could simply enjoy life on her own ."
we live in her father 's house on the lake .
<UNK> has many memories of family times <UNK> both good and bad .
"yes , today , it may be fitting to just sit here at home with our memories , on this memorial day ."
"ok , so i am still not over graduation ."
"i was so proud of <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> and tyler thompson at graduation - they each fit the bill when it comes to <UNK> and work <UNK> ."
"scholarship or no , they will <UNK> do well in college because their work <UNK> will drive them to find enough paying work to fund college ."
"ironically , their classmates may <UNK> at them , knowing that ' they are n't that smart ' ."
"smart or not , they still achieve , and this is a results - oriented world ."
"lastly , there are the <UNK> os as <UNK> described them in her <UNK> the ones who sat back <UNK> high school just happen to them ."
they are the ones with the brilliant test scores but mediocre <UNK> the ones who have yet to live up to their potential .
"the <UNK> lack discipline , and somehow must find some in order to make an honest go of the future ."
no names to the <UNK> of the class of <#> .
there is still time to change the road that they are on .
i had to take off my glasses to wipe away the tears because i could n't see clearly for a moment there .
i am not the only <UNK> my mother tells me that my grandmother <UNK> the <#> who never learned to drive was also a democrat .
"i am certainly not the <#> with the most interesting <UNK> <UNK> my cousin <UNK> crown <UNK> , takes the <UNK>"
now if have to sit back and see how andrew lives his <UNK> for better or worse .
"i went ahead and put together a memories poster for project <UNK> with photos from birth , through <UNK> , <UNK> and high school ."
"he will not be pleased when he sees it , because he forbid me to do it-"
<UNK> had he been <UNK> i might have forgotten altogether ......
i heard yesterday about the remains of <UNK> <UNK> found in rock creek park in washington .
"i know that her parents will be relieved after this time to have closure to her <UNK> , though no answers ."
"this year , with andrew going out more and more , and coming in later and"
"later , was simply a <UNK> to him not being home at all for weeks and/or months at a time ."
i will virtually have to trust that i have <UNK> in him some sort of survival skills .
my gut response is ' i am too old for <UNK> but i should n't look at it that way .
my parents seemed far older than i am now when i left home .
"so , he is sharing in on our <#> minutes a month <UNK> <#> night and weekend minutes and the rest of our <#> <UNK> minutes"
"ok , so today is my husband 's <UNK> his <UNK> birthday but the 1st that he will spend without his <UNK> ."
he mentioned it last <UNK> that this the 1st birthday without his mom or his dad ( his dad died last july and his mom in february )
that is so sad to be an <UNK> even at <#> years of age .
he is coming to a late lunch with me at the <UNK> and we will have a late supper with cake and ice cream after <UNK> 's soccer game .
he has requested new blue jeans ( size <UNK> the size has not <UNK> in <#> years of marriage )
"<UNK> <UNK> no buttons , no <UNK> , no fancy pockets , <UNK> just plain jeans ."
"i thought that there were many <UNK> questions , even for a show that will probably foster a few major motion pictures now that the weekly serial has ended ."
"ah , <UNK> maybe she 'll do the mary tyler moore thing and throw her hat up into the <UNK> .... ...."
"but she was so <UNK> in traditional marriage that she never drove a car , so i guess it does n't count ."
".... <UNK> that i have <UNK> that issue off my chest , i feel much <UNK>"
"ok , so last night i went with <UNK> and my mother to a mother - daughter event at her church ."
"the event was called "" celebrating weddings at <UNK> ' or something like that ."
the banquet room was decorated like a wedding reception .
"i had never met , and her grown daughter from <UNK> ."
we found ourselves discussing the big <UNK> bust from last fall that took place in fields between us and the prison .
i ca n't recall the actual plant <UNK> but it was <UNK> .
the plants were grown amongst the weeds rather than the traditional corn plants .
"anyway , it was nice to have something in common with this woman who has lived near me without meeting me for over <#> years ."
and it was nice to sit with my female family during the style show of wedding <UNK> .
after the style show we had punch and wedding cake in the <UNK> <UNK> ate a large piece and since i had <UNK> she sat on my lap .
"for those who have had their daughters since birth , since may sound <UNK> but for someone who is <UNK> up on a <UNK> <UNK> this was huge ."
"she felt like getting up in my lap , and it felt right ."
i asked her if she wanted to try on my wedding dress <#> <UNK> she just <UNK> at the notion ... ....
mean <UNK> does n't do <UNK> - <UNK> .
so i kind of <UNK> it during the ceremony and it is in few of the pictures .
i have been told since that my hair was probably too clean .
"<#> years later , i really do still like that <UNK> its simplicity , its lack of <UNK> and expense , and the fact that i made it myself ."
"princess di married the month after i <UNK> with far greater expense and <UNK> , and without the happy ending , alas ...."
then came the ultimate <UNK> ' you know <UNK> your blog is almost as bad as grandma 's christmas newsletter ' now that hurts .
"my parents ( and now just my mom ) write this <UNK> christmas <UNK> , with semi accurate information that is"
<UNK> my mother and i fell out for a time when she wrote about my <UNK> and stated as fact that it would have been twins .
the twins part was pure <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> was quite <UNK> .
to this day i <UNK> that their college friends from <#> - <#> did not need to know about my <UNK> .
"therefore , i will compare each and every blog to a christmas newsletter from <UNK> and hopefully edit out any information that would similarly upset my children ."
"of course , i really do n't think that i have <UNK> my children as much as could have been done .... ...."
"<UNK> back to the <UNK> <UNK> we in mud up to our <UNK> , cold and exhausted ."
"my sons helped put together the <UNK> <UNK> , and the strawberry <UNK> ."
"they chatted away during the entire <UNK> it is so fulfilling for a mother , even the <UNK> <UNK> , to see her children having positive , <UNK> interaction ."
"none of your business , next question ... .... ' of course , <UNK> is much too mean to care about looking <UNK>"
"she may even switch to an <UNK> and <UNK> theme to be totally <#> 's , her basic comfort zone ."
"as the teacher says , there is nothing new under the sun . ...."
i was listening to fresh air on npr coming back from picking up <UNK> from wednesday night church ( that 's <UNK>
"i was not actually at church with her , i stayed home and <UNK> <UNK> wine .... )"
"he also said that whatever goes up should make a profound impact on the ny <UNK> , just like the trade towers ."
"( yes , gentle readers , that visit has become <UNK> with losing <UNK> in the subway at 11:00 pm on a saturday night ..."
".... ) my father , the <UNK> , always <UNK> that now is always the best time to go ."
"you ca n't afford to wait until you retire , because circumstances could be worse then for the trip than they are now ."
"<UNK> words have yet to be spoken , for at <#> he is <UNK> <UNK> , and travels only to the dining room of the <UNK> ."
"home , with help , in a wheelchair ."
i am right this minute wishing that i was on a train bound for <UNK> or <UNK> or rome .
if you should hear that i have actually gone ahead and done such a <UNK> be advised that i planned to do this crazy last minute thing all <UNK> ....
these days he is <#> and oh so glad to be not going any more .
he <UNK> high school <UNK> did n't we all ) .
"i have sent a camera to school with my personal <UNK> , with a promise of a fat commission if he can somehow photograph this event ."

"<UNK> received an academic letter , the social studies award ( <UNK> with david s. ) the french award , and the <UNK> <UNK> award ."
"he and david tied for awards tonight , with meghan <UNK> ."
"i used them today in my beef <UNK> , and most plates came back with the mushrooms picked out like they were some kind of evil <UNK> ."
"i love their taste , especially in rich <UNK> <UNK> next time i will use plain old button mushrooms as not to confuse the <UNK> ."
another mother 's day for the mean <UNK> .
no breakfast in <UNK> not even a pot of coffee awaiting my <UNK> into the kitchen .
my mothers day gift generally comes from the <UNK> ... ....
"ok , i am going to pay tribute to a left <UNK> candidate ."
"tonight i gave a prom dinner for my <#> independent study students <UNK> and <UNK> , and kelly the daughter of <#> of my servers ."
that means that i have known her for at least <#> years .
.... there has been much said about the racial mix at this <UNK> <UNK> 's mother has called about the <UNK> 's more than once .....
i have had much time to think about the race issue this week since learning that i have black <UNK> ....
"anyway , my <UNK> mobile brother <UNK> to research my black heritage , and i <UNK> it <UNK> be worse than my <UNK> heritage . ...."
why is <UNK> <UNK> such an uncomfortable <UNK> ?
"now , there are healthy looking naturally thin <UNK> whose hair is <UNK> and whose skin has a nice glow ."
"these <#> looked <UNK> , drawn , and with limp hair and a flat affect ."
"of course , if it had n't been for her i might have married my sweet david , who is now <UNK> , fat , and working in d.c ."
"i like being married to my sweet <UNK> , thank you very much susan <UNK> i am grateful that i got my appetite back at some point ... ...."
"ok , so it is prom time , and this mean <UNK> is really <UNK> off about the whole thing ."
"i ordered the <UNK> , and have given over the check to pay for it ."
but i can not forgive the <UNK> of a showing prior to the prom .
i do n't care how many couples will also be in the <UNK> their parents want to see them too .
so what if they have to make <#> separate stops around town before the <UNK> them 's the breaks .
i 'll keep you posted on this prom <UNK> thing.. ....
"of all the subject matter that they could have chosen , condoms was the theme for both shows ."
"the good news is that condom education no longer must rely on liberal health education classes , or progressive <UNK> , parents etc to promote ."
"now , those <#> are not my idea of an image to which <#> would choose to <UNK> with regards to looks at least ."
"madonna has <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> stuff , but this photo makes me unlikely to begin a yoga routine or give up <UNK> .... ...."
i got my hair cut today after the lunch rush .
i got to read the george <UNK> tribute issue of rolling stone magazine .
"i enjoyed reading what people like tom petty , <UNK> john , <UNK> , etc said about the dear <UNK> ."
apparently dylan got a kick out of <UNK> and his video camera .
<UNK> with death leave <#> <UNK> but <UNK> that 's <UNK> i feel this morning after our family ' brush ' with near disaster .
andrew complained yesterday morning that he smelled something funny in the basement as he was leaving for school .
"he got towels from the laundry room to <UNK> up the mess , only to find flames coming out of the motor at this point ."
"by the time i got home , the <UNK> had installed a new element , and the hot water was again functional ."
.... it has just occured to me that <UNK> and i missed <#> on tuesday night while we visited with our relatives .
this is a really confusing and intense <UNK> it has only a few episodes <UNK> i have <UNK> time seeing a happy ending to it all .
"of course , the world of television is no longer about happy <UNK> ."
my prediction about the last episode of ally <UNK> is that she will be left all alone after <#> years of dating and <UNK> all those mr <UNK> .
i do enjoy alias on sunday <UNK> enjoy sitting with my spouse and watching alias on sunday <UNK> but mostly do n't make time for <UNK> .
i wish i had a <UNK> rating box so i could destroy the curve . ....
"whoa , there ..... mean <UNK> has had a brief <UNK> of reason ."
", mean <UNK> feels somewhat better , and will go on enjoying her early morning blogging while the coffee <UNK> and before she starts in cooking with a <UNK> ."
we had to make <UNK> calls for shop <UNK> to suck up the <UNK> the <UNK> landlord took <#> look at the <UNK> and left .
"<UNK> is my word of the <UNK> thanks to ann silver 's sister in <UNK> , <UNK> hello ann 's sister ! !"
i am not nearly as mean as i seem in writing ... ....
bruce <UNK> and his wife mary are visiting from arizona .
we have not seen them since we took the children to grand canyon the first time on a spring break at least <#> years ago .

he is the adopted son of my grandfather george <UNK> 's <UNK> brother <UNK> the <#> with <UNK> who became a minister .
"he was quite kind about it all to <UNK> , telling her that they had this special thing in common ."
"therefore , there are black <UNK> walking around this earth related to me through my <UNK> ."
i hope they are better looking than some of the ones i have met ... ....
"ok , so i saw <UNK> count 'em <#> snakes in my yard yesterday , and i am <UNK> ."
"i am not a snake <UNK> , nor <#> of those scary snake <UNK> - bible belt types ."
i do see good environmental signs in having a healthy crop of snakes .
"secondly , the kinds of snakes we have appear to be the kind that keep down the <UNK> <UNK> we are not seeing mice in the house these days ."
they are big and long and <#> seem to live together in a <UNK> on the other side of the deck .
"the others are <UNK> snakes , <UNK> who live amongst the rose bushes ."
"as i said , the appearance of healthy snakes must mean that our environment is relatively healthy for us humans ."
"i will feel even better about it if i start seeing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , that is ... ...."
"ok , i know that there is already a saint <UNK> and many churches named after him ."
our saint <UNK> is an incredibly <UNK> <UNK> who asks what can i do next rather than when can i go home .
i am thankful to know him let alone be mean <UNK> ... ....
"today 's agenda involves a <UNK> party for <#> , with fried chicken ."
the <UNK> laughed it off like he should have known <UNK> andrew was n't from a <UNK> family so he would have had no clue .
i have out all of the central kentucky <UNK> open to the secret fried chicken recipes .
"frankly , this whole fried chicken thing makes me a nervous wreck ."
our deep - pockets customer last night ( read this drug rep with a <UNK> to spend his <UNK> bucks rather than lose them ) was truly annoying .
"the whites he bought were already chilled , and he requested that the <UNK> white be opened <UNK> rather than the australian <#> ."
"in my book , a good host leads with his best wine , not his worst ."
.... then he <UNK> a bag at me holding new <UNK> like we would n't have <#> ourselves .
"he also brought beer , a lot of <UNK> <#> cases of miller and <#> of bud light , and <#> <UNK> of <UNK> ."
they had been long wrapped up in the <UNK> and he stood there watching while i tried to <UNK> <UNK> dinners from them .
"yes , he did pay for them , but he was such a jerk in <UNK> on his <UNK> property ."
he actually was <UNK> enough to ask if he had everything that he had paid for .....
i thought he was going to go through the <UNK> himself .
he then <UNK> to chase down the doctor who did the presentation at her car and gave her several of the <UNK> dinners
", like he did it all himself , just for her ."
"no gentle readers , i took them home myself ...... <UNK> really likes good beer ...."
maybe i should find some blogs written by my - children - are - perfect - faced lifted mothers so i can <UNK> at them .
"of course , those mothers probably pay for someone to blog for them ."
because all this typing would damage the pretend nails and expensive <UNK> <UNK> .
"there will be about <#> in the group , including friends and dates ."
yesterday the mother of <#> got in my face and asked me if i knew that her daughter 's date was black .
"i knew because she told me , and had to admit such ."
this mother was embarassed that she was so upset about the race <UNK> and upset seemingly because i did not pick up the phone to tell her .
i did n't tell her because it was of no concern to me- the race <UNK> she should be more worried that this boy is <#> or so -
but i <UNK> go into that because she was so upset .
i am not sure what she wanted me to say or do about it .
these are nice <UNK> and i told them they could invite their <UNK> end of story .
i can not wait until all of this end - of - year stuff is over ... ....
yesterday was may <UNK> and i had meant to blog about my <UNK> i had <#> bushes <UNK> yesterday .
"this is quite early for roses , but then it has been quite warm ."
"the first to bloom was <UNK> <UNK> , which i saw <UNK> in great <UNK> years ago at <UNK> gardens in the <UNK> ."
it started to bloom on <UNK> probably the earliest that any c - w rose has <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> and this bush also has only a few <UNK> a <UNK> pink that has a bit of white <UNK> through .
"i say <UNK> , fo <UNK> after the <UNK> last night there may be nothing left ."
"andrew , <UNK> and i watched the multi - warnings on tv , and were <UNK> that the path of the potential tornado <UNK> south of <UNK> ."
"the rain and possibly hail was intense for a time , however ."
"neither will bother my new dawn rose , however , it is already dead , after <#> years i tried to move it and killed it ."
"the <UNK> of summer clothes is in the way , but not yet <UNK> and filled with the winter clothes ."
tht sounds too <UNK> i take it back ... ....
"ok , so the <UNK> have reached <UNK> , co and estimate another <#> <UNK> miles of riding before they hit the kansas border ."
today the temp was at least <#> degrees .
<UNK> said that it was like riding in a full - body blow dryer .
they plan to get up early and ride the next <#> days before the heat or the wind get <UNK> .
"speaking of hot , when does the loyal opposition travel down to texas ?"
i hope that the texas clan are e - connected ... ....
"ok , so my multi - summer <UNK> curse is over ......."
my technique seemed no different than past <UNK> <UNK> with the thumb in search of <#> with a hollow sound .
"for summers in past memories , these hollow <UNK> were false <UNK> , and the <UNK> destined for <UNK> dessert , thrown over the hill ."
not this <UNK> it is sweet and <UNK> and <UNK>
i may not even share it with the <UNK> ....
"ok , so i had the best cake yesterday afternoon , and i am not really a cake person ."
the wedding cake was made by someone named <UNK> .
"it was white , <UNK> , <UNK> with some sort of <UNK> <UNK> , with <UNK> jam spread <UNK> between the layers ."
i am somewhat surprised that she did n't collapse the chair <UNK> to the <UNK> ....
"ok , so i left <#> pork <UNK> , at <#> degrees in the oven overnight ."
"i got caught behind a woman in the <UNK> aisle who had <#> ear to her cell , and the other handling each item on each shelf ."
the was <UNK> with her significant other about their mutual need for each and every <UNK> .... so much for shopping lists .
i left the <UNK> with an amused and <UNK> soul ...... and
"yes , when i got to work , those pork <UNK> were like <UNK> logs ."
"ok , so i enjoy writing in my blog , and this enjoyment may help me to live longer ......."
last night i sat and watched a <UNK> wanna - be whose i ca n't recall with an hour - long special on stress .
a <UNK> noted that <UNK> is even more effective in talk therapy in helping people work through their <UNK> .
"when i called , they were fixing to eat a <UNK> , which is a shared joke between families ."
<UNK> reported that they had had some sort of equipment <UNK> and that bill had helped him to <UNK> a solution .
"the condo is located near <UNK> , and is quite tony and expensive ."
today they ride up and over <UNK> <UNK> the highest they will be on this trip .
"ok , so i am looking forward to hearing what <UNK> does with <UNK> 's dream on ."
".... and of course , some songs contains such <UNK> he could be reading off his grocery <UNK> .... ...."
i can remember saying the pledge in elementary <UNK> i do not feel that it has made me into a better american to have said it .
"while i have the freedom to worship my version of god , i do not wish to force others to do so ."
"i am also against school prayer , for the same reasons . .... ...."
"speaking of <UNK> devotion , my mother 's dog <UNK> continues to be under my feet at every turn ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> this morning from <UNK> , colorado ."
"their ride yesterday was <UNK> and into the wind all day , and this day 's ride appears to be more of the same ."
they are the couple that <UNK> wants us to be when we are in our <#> 's .
"fine , as long as i do n't have to ride <UNK> and into the wind .... ...."
"ok , so the raging storm came and went before the swim meet , and it happened after all ."
i sat through <#> hours and <#> minutes of pure <UNK> doing <UNK> paperwork and <UNK> the comments of those not doing paperwork at the pool .
if i hear ' do n't you ever rest ? ' <#> more time i believe that i will just go off .
"andrew has been <UNK> nice to <UNK> , and she seems to respond to this kindness with pleasant behavior ."
i just hope her medication holds out ... .... ....
"of course , it appears to be deadly to <UNK> ..."
.... <UNK> called <UNK> he and <UNK> rode <#> miles today .
"is this woman just noticing that this was a dog not a person , or has this dog just been buried ?"
"my picture of a pleasant eternity could include a cat or a dog on my lap , under a shady tree ......."
"why ca n't her parents , both dead , of course , embrace the same eternal rest with <UNK> kind of adopt him ."
"turns out that <UNK> has no law <UNK> the mixed <UNK> of humans and <UNK> or <UNK> , or sharks and <UNK> for that matter ."
this woman 's <UNK> sounds as foolish and complaining that her parents are buried next to blacks or <UNK>
et al ....... she had better worry about the bigger <UNK> like
"she is a <UNK> , <UNK> from a puppy farm , and should <UNK> sympathy rather than <UNK> ."
"however , <#> can not move about in this <UNK> without that dog <UNK> , with her <UNK> making noises on the <UNK> floor ."
i keep stepping on her feet because she is always <UNK> .
"andrew and i walked last night , around the circle , after it had <UNK> off ( somewhat ) ."
we were on our <#> or 4th lap when a <UNK> 's truck pulled up in front of my mother 's house .
"what did she buy and why did n't she tell us to expect a truck , and she certainly does n't need what she bought ........"
turns out if was a false <UNK> they were looking for an address on <UNK> island road not the <UNK> and they finally drove off .
"ok , so i enjoyed <UNK> , in spite of its connections to madonna , <UNK> ) i <UNK> ."
i thought the parts with the dog were just too funny .
"today , <UNK> park comes out in video , so i will run by the <UNK> and see if i can score a copy ."
also this <UNK> a beautiful <UNK> which i also ca n't wait to see .
i just ca n't seem to get to <UNK> before these movies have moved <UNK> but videos will just have to do .
"i can hardly handle children who drive at my age , let alone change <UNK> ."
"of course , madonna surely changes no <UNK> that is what the <UNK> is for ."
"ok , so mean <UNK> gets really mean during <UNK> ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> are packing up my mom 's car , and the <UNK> will soon leave for colorado ."
"oh , so many <UNK> are possible , and mean <UNK> has worried about each and every potential fly is the <UNK> ."
then there are the worries at <UNK> <UNK> will be spending <#> weeks at camp <#> roads cafe .
"<UNK> usually takes care of daycare , as he has always had more <UNK> in his schedule ."
he also has a <UNK> with a <UNK> that has served us well over the years as place for kids to chill out until a better option comes along .
"in the restaurant we have no such <UNK> , so <UNK> will hang out in the kitchen , or with customers ......."
"i thought she did a fine job , but could n't quite figure out why they cast that particular actor as her <UNK> - do - well brother ."
"he did not seem to be related to her at all , in looks or <UNK> ."
"not that all siblings have <UNK> <UNK> , but these <#> had <UNK>"
i <UNK> rented <UNK> but have n't watched it yet .
i have til midnight <UNK> maybe i can watch it later on tonight and beg andrew to drive it back into town ...
i have n't seen a first run film since lord of the <UNK> and there are many out there that i want to watch .
"i trust the movie will be in true bbc - style , with the usual cast of period costume players , like colin <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> is also in this picture , though i am not sure which part she plays ."
"or maybe i really just want a <UNK> to call my <UNK> .... well , back to this bike trip ."
"gentle readers , bear with me until these <UNK> are back ."
"ok , so my last blog , the <#> about <UNK> brown , has disappeared ."
i do n't know which makes me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or the fact that i have to drive <#> miles to buy a bottle of wine .
i am also unsure about the correct term for <UNK> hero or <UNK> <UNK> somehow makes me think of cheap romance <UNK> not brave female role models .
"further , <UNK> has no children nor spouse , who can also be <UNK> to public <UNK> attacks based on <UNK> 's actions ."
"ok , so i am so glad that the italian <UNK> are <UNK> because no <#> blogs like the loyal <UNK> sorry about <UNK> ."
i am also sorry that i did n't save some of the more <UNK> responses to your letter to the editor .
"ok , so mean <UNK> has had a revelation about cable television , <UNK> and other <UNK> stuff ."
"not that i am a soccer <UNK> , but i like to watch on <UNK> ."
paying for cable tv will not get you a tow truck when your car is broken down <UNK> .
i will just have to read about this <UNK> soccer game in the paper tomorrow morning .......
the second and subsequent readings are get the <UNK> points of plot development that i missed while finding out what happens in book .
in each book there is a feeling that the madness involved was a <UNK> <UNK> that the madness was somehow the only option for the <UNK> .
i see this book as a <UNK> for independent minded women if only to show them what not to do .
"next i think i will dig up <UNK> in the <UNK> , and see how h. <UNK> 's madness <UNK> ... ...."
"ok , so i have to report on something really funny that <UNK> said to me last night at the <UNK> after the <UNK> run ."
but the thread throughout his <UNK> is worth <UNK> and <UNK> .
a brief note to my own <UNK> no fake flowers near my <UNK> when i am gone ......
people still comment on how our <UNK> was more charming then .
the cat is much more <UNK> she wo n't stop <UNK> until the is let into the house .
enough said ....... mean <UNK> 's quiet morning <UNK> over and she has to go to work .
"ok , so mean <UNK> has had a wicked witch experience ."
"i have <UNK> with <UNK> in the past , but this year i opted to ride a bike as <UNK> 's <UNK> ."
"<UNK> lent me his mother 's <UNK> <UNK> , which is an <UNK> model with a basket ."
"ok , so i have become <UNK> for <UNK> , the scandal of my youth ."
"yesterday marked the 30th anniversary of the <UNK> <UNK> , and the beginning of the end for tricky dick nixon and his <UNK> ."
nixon wanted to be <UNK> so badly that he put all <UNK> aside to make it happen .
"some have <UNK> the list to include pat <UNK> , who was working in the white house at the time ."
some say that <UNK> and <UNK> made him up .
"no matter , we will not find out the identity until the person in question passes away , which could be years ."
"ok , so no matter where i went this band festival weekend , the big question was about the police <UNK> were you there , and what really happened ?"
"the lunch crowd was much <UNK> on sunday than on saturday , so we closed at 2:00 and were home by 4:00 ."
"it felt like the <#> hours at <UNK> , the race that is constant on a closed <UNK> it just goes until it is over ."
"ok , so our big <UNK> job last night was <UNK> by a police <UNK> ......."
<#> <UNK> cops looking for illegal service of alcohol in a dry county .
"ok , so today is our 21st wedding anniversary ."
tomorrow morning we plan to celebrate andrew 's 18th birthday over an early <UNK> i ca n't believe that it was <#> years since he was a tiny <UNK>
"ok , so we are starting to get the really crazy people on the phone at the restaurant this week ."
the first call of the day was a woman who wanted the name of our source for dry ice . '
you do n't use dry ice in <UNK> ? ' she asked <UNK> . ' no .
".... ' i could n't even tell her where she could begin to look for dry ice , either ."
"then we got a call from ohio asking if we could deliver <UNK> and <UNK> to her mother in union , <UNK> ."
she woman seemed somewhat <UNK> that we were n't willing to go that far <UNK> to deliver lunch
i assured her that by saturday night not even i would be guaranteed a place to park .
"she seemed kind of <UNK> , like someone could n't just stand in a spot and hold it for her"
......... then we got a call from someone asking if we are hiring . '
"jerry replied that neither of those are our <UNK> , and could she have been mistaken on who she called ."
"oh , no , the woman said , i have it all written"
"...... well there is your problem , you did n't book your meeting at the <UNK> inn ........"
"needless to say , she is having her meeting at the <UNK> inn"
".... now if this company manages money like it <UNK> meetings , then i pity any who attend and/or sign on for their services ."
"of course , if she actually sent out the invites to our place rather than <UNK> , it could be very funny today around noon .... ...."
of which coverage lasts <#> hour for a race that lasts only <#> - <#> minutes at most .
i was disappointed that war <UNK> could n't pull off a <UNK> racing and <UNK> in <UNK> could have used that boost to ratings .
i was most disappointed that i was n't able to watch either the men 's or women 's finals from french open .
i have walked by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> on the way to <UNK> <UNK> and i am fascinated by the game .
those williams sisters are <UNK> <UNK> though i would have liked to see j. <UNK> win another grand slam event .
"i was on my way to <UNK> while that match was being played , and i was at church while the men 's final was played ."
<#> of <UNK> 's true <UNK> is her determination to not have cable tv .
"this week , she will celebrate <#> years of cable - free marriage , by the way ."
.... on an odd note -- i had dinner with elvis <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a few weeks ago .
it would have been fun to have paid attention .
i was deeply <UNK> in conversation with my mom friends about the long showers our sons take .
perhaps they were listening to the moms at the next table !
"> ok , so i have never heard of <UNK> <UNK> , and had to ask my children ."
"ok , so mean <UNK> has to clean her house this weekend ! !"
i have invited a <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> to visit the restaurant for <#> days next <UNK> and also invited her to stay with us .
"she read about me in the <UNK> , the <UNK> magazine of chi <UNK> <UNK> and called me up <#> day ."
"she is from austin , texas , and sounds very blond on the phone ."
"she wants to have her own restaurant <#> day , maybe i can talk her out of it ...."
"ok , so i am enjoying the letter - to - the - editor debate over the ten <UNK> and the bible vs. the state ."
the letter yesterday from a guy from <UNK> was pretty good ( not as good as
"this country was built on religious <UNK> and that means freedom from having to deal with the religion of others in public places like schools , <UNK> , etc ."
"ok , so mean <UNK> <UNK> being portrayed as mean <UNK> ."
she told him that i had refused to feed her supper .
"thankfully <UNK> reminded her that she had already eaten supper with the neighbors , and that it was mean to lie to try to get a second meal ."
<UNK> <UNK> that she had only had a little snack ........ that girl would eat <#> if allowed to do so
"ok , so i forgot to watch <UNK> in alaska ."
"do they vote them out of the state , or am i confusing this silly show with another <UNK> <UNK> production on another channel ?"
"on the blogger home page , there was a <UNK> aimed at a select crowd of <UNK> if you blog in nyc , put yourself on our map ."
today we did n't get a <UNK> sunday paper ( it is <UNK> and i <UNK> failed to pay for the <UNK> to be extended past may ... .... )
so i got dressed and walked up to my mother 's mailbox and ' borrowed ' her paper .
"she does n't read it until after church , and she will be coming down here for <UNK> does n't that <UNK> petty <UNK> ?"
i hate to go to church without reading the <UNK> i feel so out of touch .
"this morning was perfect for paper - <UNK> dry , quite warm , with a freshly <UNK> <UNK> of a breeze ."
"none of your blow - away - the - <UNK> <UNK> , mind you ."
my sunday paper reading is always <UNK> as <UNK> rides his bike with friends on sundays and none of the children get up this early ... ....
<UNK> for the letter about the <UNK> 's patient arrested in <UNK> for eating a <#> cent candy bar .
i shop at <UNK> for the restaurant for such <UNK> as <UNK> crackers and <UNK> kidney beans .
it is close to the restaurant when we run out of homemade bread during lunch .
"the manager is always very nice to me , as are some of the <UNK> <UNK> ."
"however , there are also some <UNK> <UNK> who have n't got ' a lick of sense ' ."
"the store manager is off on <UNK> i can only hope that this incident happened on her day off , and that <#> of the <UNK> was responsible ."
it is also possible that the store has a black and white policy on <UNK> with no <UNK> for <UNK> circumstances like <UNK> .
"i would not be surprised if <UNK> is <UNK> by those who know this woman , or know of this incident ."
"either way , there will be no happy ending ."
then i came home to discover that someone had drank the last of my last bottle of wine .
"ok , so my book club met last night and organized itself ."
"while this might not be fast - breaking news , it does make life easier ."
"we have decided upon <#> books , and <#> meeting dates and <#> meeting <UNK> all in advance so we can make read ahead as needed ."
i have <UNK> hosted the meeting at the end of february ( <UNK> it my birthday book club ) and serve a meal that goes along with the book .
"i chose jane austin 's <UNK> , because we have never read austin and it is relatively short ."
i do hope that <UNK> and <UNK> missed book club members will read this book and plan on coming on wednesday february <#> at 7:00 .... .... ....
"ok , so i stand <UNK> <UNK> starts with a <UNK>"
they are ex - <UNK> husband graduated west point ) .
"i am <UNK> to so many republicans in <#> place , especially now that my brother does not visit often ."
"i did get out of hand when they were all <UNK> about <UNK> , and i mentioned my newly discovered but <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> ."
"ah well , it was nice of them to come for a few days and cheer up my <UNK> ...."
i think i 'll stick with these colours then .
i do n't think this will be read much anyway .
i 'm still <UNK> about with the colours of this thing .
i actually do n't know why i created a private blog .
"anyway , just emailed a cute pic of the kid to kelly ."
might print it out aswell and hang in in my office .
i caught her in mid jump in a <UNK> castle at our <UNK> this year .
this is being a real pain in the ass .
i ca n't tell you how many times i 've typed out a fucking load of stuff only to have blogger lose it on the upload
* <UNK> i hate the colours of this template but i like the layout .
will have to <UNK> some more if i can deal with blogger 's <UNK> .
of course blogger 's being a pain in the ass though .
<UNK> and loads of ' page not found ' errors when i try to update my settings and template .
i hate the colours of this template but i like the layout .
"ah well , will just have to deal with it ."
i tried <UNK> but it 's too <UNK> .
i ca n't work out how to edit old posts so fuck that .
i 'd end up getting <UNK> out by the bitch <UNK> anyway .
wonder if any will be clever enough to cop on to this .
"oh well , i did n't exactly hide it did i ?"
:) now i have to <UNK> with ftp settings .
so i got the <UNK> <UNK> working and it 's looking quite pretty if i do say so myself .
i really just need to move the content over and play with it some more before i spring it on everyone .
oh and <UNK> needs to sort out the reason why it wo n't email new <UNK> .
i think i 'm going to ask my boss if we could send them a candy <UNK> or something .
"they 've been sooo helpful getting me going and very patient with me as well , especially when i broke it the day they got it up and running :)"
i think i need to get up and move around because i 've been <UNK> with the site for a couple hours now .
took the kid and visited <UNK> this morning .
then we went and did some grocery shopping for her .
so here i am in my <UNK> and thick track pants .
so i 'm absolutely baking . and my <UNK> is killing me .
went swimming last night and got a horrific leg <UNK> just as i was diving under water .
and just at that moment the poor <UNK> got hit in the head with a volleyball .
she went down the speed slide for the first time all by herself .
other than the <UNK> <UNK> it gave her i think she liked it !
anyway i 'm off to do ... something .
dunno what but need a break from the comp .
and i get to spend the next <#> hours looking at the computer .
lately i 've gotten a little tired of being online all the time .
i think i 'm going to take a break from it in the evenings .
"i was mainly on to talk to <UNK> and dee but they 're caught up in football fever ( well , <UNK> is anyway ) and big brother uk ."
"so , while i adore talking to them , i need to get away from the comp and get things done around the house etc ."
maybe i 'll take the <UNK> swimming tonight .
"thank goodness because if i do n't start making more money soon , i 'm really going to be in the shit ."
"i dunno where it all goes , it 's not like i buy <UNK> things ."
hell i have n't bought new clothes for myself in ages even .
and the poor <UNK> is wearing clothes from last summer .
and i do n't know what to get her ....
maybe i 'll get her <#> of the hp books on cd .
she likes to listen to them in her room - what a cutie .
anyway i 'm off to see if the damn <UNK> has finished installing php yet because i need to get going on the <UNK> site .
i 've been <UNK> for <#> weeks now because of them * <UNK> will write later .
ooo ahh i wonder if this <#> still works ...
i have so many blogs to write in any more ...
i dunno what i 've gotten myself into and i dunno if i have it in me to blog in <#> different places .
i might even start <#> for the public <UNK> will have to see if there 's any interest . anyway .
well i 'm glad i came to my senses .
i wrote a <UNK> blog about something personal and decided i 'd better not publish it .
what is the point of this blog if i ca n't say what i want .
what is the point of any blog really .
maybe <UNK> was right in that these things are pointless .
i have to <UNK> myself in case of <UNK> eyes .
"i 'll just continue to rant about mundane things because oddly enough , i enjoy it ."
"on the other hand , some public blogs are great reads ."
i love going to blogger.com ' blogs of note ' section and checking those out .
and i 'd love for my other <#> to get a nice <UNK> .
"i 'm a feedback whore , what can i say ?"
:) man the day 's nearly half over .
i am the <UNK> - tab queen though .
whenever i 'm stuck on work or waiting for things to load i flip over and blog for a bit .
which will explain why my thoughts seem a bit random .
i started writing this <#> at <#> am and it 's now <#> .
i 've made progress on my php stuff ( slow - going as it is ) and written and deleted about <#> and a half entries in here .
"as well as checked email , <UNK> and <UNK> for website tracking software ."
"there , finally got this journal looking the way i want it ."
"fixed it so my name does n't show up , so hopefully this journal will stop showing up in search engines ."
i did an innocent search on my name and this <UNK> thing popped up .
"i know this is n't exactly top - secret , but i would like some place away from <UNK> eyes - they know who they are ."
"i 'm making myself sound like some government spy , hehe :)"
"nope , sorry to <UNK> , just your average everyday person on the internet doing nothing that amounts to much ."
i think i 've got my website looking pretty good .
it <UNK> for different resolutions so people wo n't have to deal with funky <UNK> all over the place .
i do n't know how it looks in <UNK> though .
"what a pain in the ass , making a site compatible in different <UNK> ."
"anyway fixed all the broken links ( thanks rick ! ) , including about <#> of them on my british <UNK> map ."
i had n't thought of checking that <#> for a while and there were so many dead links on it !
so i <UNK> through the net looking for new ones and i think i got them all .
i 'd love to add some shows to the map but it 's far too much hassle for now .
i <UNK> the look of my site from someone 's blogger template because i loved it so much .
i left their name in the <UNK> tag as credit .
woohoo ! going to take <#> out of it and put it aside for the trip .
"same in <#> weeks , then again on the third <#> before we go ."
"if i end up getting the child support checks aswell , then jason the <UNK> can help fund his daughter 's first big <UNK> ."
i 'm sooo looking forward to this now that it 's getting closer to the time to go .
i was n't sure i 'd be able to go what with thanksgiving usually being a time when the family gets together and all .
might be a family <UNK> because kelly does it too .
we end up <UNK> every bloody thing until we eventually drive ourselves mad .
and it never turns out how we expected .
"ah well , i 'm not going to dwell on it ."
time for <UNK> up in bed with my book .
<UNK> . and underneath it is a <UNK> layer of ice .
my car doors were frozen shut this morning - i love when that happens . need to buy de - <UNK> .
"anyway , luckily yesterday i got it in my head to go get my new tires on the car ."
"i 'm not a very good <UNK> , hehe ."
"i meant to get <#> tire this check and another tire next check , but <UNK> had a deal on some used ones ."
"well i am going , but still , i 'm not going to have much money ."
luckily i 've only got to cover gas and food and * maybe * a bit of shopping in chicago .
"then it 's up to rick 's to see the big pink house , <UNK> that makes me <UNK> my big tough cousin living in a pink house :)"
"much better than <UNK> ( though , frankly i liked <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> always seem negative about it ."
of course it was n't as good as silence .
"even red dragon was n't as good as that , but it was still scary and creepy and made me look away a few times ."
"got <UNK> to make a trip tick <UNK> for me , free for <UNK> members so woohoo to that ."
i remember my aunt using <#> for our <UNK> to the east coast and it was dead handy .
i 'm about to begin typing up <#> <UNK> on how to quit smoking for the website .
waiting still to hear from kelly in scotland .
i was just re - reading what i wrote yesterday and i realised
"it sounds kind of bad , especially where i said ' i do n't care that much ' right after saying <UNK> gone to hell ."
"of course i care about my aunt , and i 'm having a difficult time <UNK> to her being gone ."
"i guess i meant that because of that , i 'm not bothered too much about losing some other things that used to be important to me , ie ."
they just do n't seem that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things .
i got a dose of perspective on it all and found
i do n't miss them as much as i thought i would .
i did n't do too badly but by the time i 'd changed everything i was too tired to check links .
"then he tells me his emails to me keep bouncing , yet i 'm getting the message , so something with my <UNK>"
domain email is fucking up along the line and i ca n't figure it out .
"i tell you , i need to marry a computer <UNK> <UNK> and i would be set for life ."
"all the good ones are taken though :( anyway , i 'd better get to work , lots to do today ."
<UNK> everything 's just gone all to hell .
"<UNK> enough , i do n't care all that much ."
i know i should be glad she 's at peace ( this is what everyone says .
"if it <UNK> them , that 's all right ) , but damnit i miss her ."
i miss being able to go to her with my <UNK> .
"you know how , with your mother , you can be very close , but there are just things you do n't tell your mom ?"
of course she would often pass them along to mom but that 's ok .
i do n't like the memories of the past week - well most of them .
last week was very nice for other reasons i wo n't go into because they 're irrelevant to this train of thought .
but <UNK> 's funeral was at the same funeral home as my mother 's .
"i 'm not sure who i was crying for more , mom or <UNK> ."
it was weird being on the <UNK> edge of it all aswell .
my sister and i were n't ' immediate family ' and so we felt a little left out .
"my uncle 's relative sort of came and took over everything , from food to sorting through <UNK> 's things ."
there was n't anything left for us to do .
i suppose it 's because of all of that that i felt like there would have been more for me to do .
"i do n't know , i 'm new to the funeral thing , but i do n't like it ."
<UNK> shut them down for personal reasons and quit working for the band .
so i think dee has taken over the site and the silver rocket forum
i can still talk to <UNK> and dee so i 'm happy with that .
still have <UNK> aswell so all is not hopeless .
i 've learned beer is not that bad .
i never knew there could be so many subtle <UNK> and <UNK> in a pint .
and i now know what a power play is .
i must sound desperately silly to a sports fan but i do n't care .
i might have to take the kid sometime to <UNK> and skate the <UNK> there
. must also look into renting <UNK> if i can find it .
"anyway , have to get back into the mode of going to work ."
so i got the <UNK> to work over the weekend .
"i still ca n't seem to get my other blog , over on <UNK> , to work properly ."
"hell , i ca n't get it to work at all ."
"i was in <UNK> 's offices today <UNK> my dsl contract , and i asked a tech support guy what he thought of the problem ."
he took my business card and promised to look into the problem for me .
i hope to hear something in a day or <#> .
"if not , i will call again and see if anybody knows what 's going on ."
"i suspect that because blogger is trying to access the ftp account from the outside , <UNK> is bouncing the request back to blogger 's servers ."
i can access the ftp account from within my home because it 's within the trusted domain of <UNK> - at least that is my suspicion .
i am typing this from my <UNK> and it works again .
now if i could just get that damn <UNK> machine to boot up ...
the <UNK> is back up and running once again .
<UNK> : : i am not sure what to do .
my <UNK> refuses to come to life for me .
i do n't know if i should continue to invest time and money into my <UNK> .
"if money was not object , i 'd probably purchase a new <UNK> tower ."
more importantly i do n't know if i want to continue using the mac .
i 've been using my windows machine for the last <#> months and i have n't really had any complaints .
"i do most of my work on pc 's now , and my interests are <UNK> towards linux ."
i feel like it is not worth the effort to <UNK> this machine just for email and a couple games .
"new power supply , new <UNK> <UNK> , new <UNK> , and still everything does not work ."
"i 'd like to get it working again , but the law of <UNK> returns is starting to apply here ."
this is another post i am checking out some more html codes .
i might have to get more serious about this blog .
"shortly after <UNK> am , a <#> <UNK> struck my island ."
i can think of nothing worse than these <UNK> <UNK> .
but i should thank god no urllink major damage occurred .
"buildings on <UNK> are designed to <UNK> super <UNK> , and the <UNK> cement block construction holds up pretty well against <UNK> as well ."
i think the fact that <UNK> is an island helps as well .
it just <UNK> and <UNK> around in the ocean instead of <UNK> up against a <UNK> or other large <UNK> mass . as a testimony to that fact
", the power was restored this morning shortly before 10:00 am ."
that is some kind of record for the power authority <UNK> .
my buddy chris suggests my problems with the <UNK> on the mac are related to a <UNK> problem .
"thinking back , i was concerned about a particular screw last night ."
maybe i need to open up the box and check that .
i 'll also check that the <UNK> is seated properly it 's been a busy day .
"my afternoon meeting was productive , but i am afraid it 's left my brain a little <UNK> ."
"i am taking a <UNK> right now , trying to collect my thoughts before i proceed ."
i won a <UNK> for a filipino lunch buffet at the holiday inn today .
it was okay ; i never would have <UNK> the menu otherwise .
"i 'm <UNK> up onions and garlic now , there was a type of salsa that was heavy on the garlic ."
i guess i should have gone a little easier on it .
"maybe i should drink a mountain dew , that'll cut through anything !"
"well , it 's been a busy evening . and all my <UNK> met with failure ."
i am attempting to set up a blog over on my <UNK> site .
"it refuses to work correctly , so i imagine a call to tech <UNK> service tomorrow is in order ."
i suspect some condition of the ftp server software is blocking blogger.com from <UNK> in .
the error message say no <UNK> <UNK> were available .
my <UNK> for my <UNK> arrived today and i installed it .
"my <UNK> now has all new <UNK> : new power supply , new <UNK> <UNK> , new <UNK> ."
"after all this time and money , i 've managed to create a big <UNK> fan ."
"it powers on ( at long last ) , but there is no "" <UNK> "" of a mac starting up ."
"no video either , and i ca n't hear the hard drive spin up ."
the fan on the power supply comes on though .
"something is wrong here too , i suspect the <UNK> chip is n't <UNK> correctly ."
i 'll pull it apart tomorrow and take another look at it .
<#> of the things i was supposed to finish at work today got <UNK> .
anyway that 's all i got to <UNK> about this evening .
i <UNK> hard after work today and i am <UNK> .
that same person showed up at my house last night with a <UNK> of tomato and <UNK> that she <UNK> up for me .
it just blows me away that she followed up so thoroughly on an <UNK> comment that was made yesterday morning .
"i did n't expect to see more <UNK> for a few weeks , maybe the middle of next month ( if at all ) ."
"well , i think i got a handle on blogging and how to set up a template the way i like ."
my next step will be to convert my urllink <UNK> site over to a blog and adapt <#> of these blogger templates for my own personal use .
a friend was so impressed with the ease of this setup and blogging process she signed up at blogger as well .
i guess that is a powerful <UNK> about how easy and powerful this home <UNK> blog publishing can be .
i certainly like the ability to post messages from work to my site .
i imagine that sooner or later the corporate <UNK> .
<UNK> will figure out what is going on and shut down access .
i am now writing this from a <UNK> <UNK> .
the interface is roughly the same as that using a non internet explorer browser .
that means some of the buttons and features are not available .
"however , the regular html codes works just fine ."
"bold , <UNK> , urllink links , they all seem to work using hand <UNK> html ."
a co - worker just delivered the fruits of her garden to me .
"it is such a treat to get fresh , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> ."
the things they sell in the stores that they call <UNK> have all the taste of a <UNK> box .
"oh , the semi - annual pledge drive has started for my favorite radio station , urllink <UNK> ."
"in fact , they are the only radio station i listen to ."
if you want to make a contribution call <#> <#> <#> or visit their web page .
i think the time has come to investigate this blogger thing more thoroughly .
in case you did n't check the link on the other site this is urllink my other site
and now i am back at home and testing different <UNK> and the blogger interface .
it seems to work the best in internet explorer .
i am not sure how it will perform on the <UNK> though .
i wonder if it will go outside of the corporate <UNK> ?
this area is just a text field in my browser .
i type and press publish and the stuff appears <UNK> .
this area supports all the usual html goodies : lists urllink links bold face <UNK> and other stuff i suppose
"well , it looks like i have things finally figured out ."
i think this is finally working the way i want !
la dee da still not working .
"i do n't intend to skip out early , in fact i plan on working late ."
i just happen to prefer the office when nobody else is around and i can concentrate .
it drives me nuts because i am trying to concentrate .
i guess i am just a <UNK> at heart .
things are in full swing and i think i am starting to fall behind in my tasks .
"i 've been looking at urllink <UNK> , a cool web based email client that sure pushes the limit of explorer ."
"oh , and i am still contemplating that alpha computer ."
"apparently this interface does not work through the magic of <UNK> , my <UNK> browser of choice for my mac ."
it works in ie <#> on my pc - nothing like <UNK> to the masses .
"<UNK> tastes just fine too , but i do n't have to like it ."
i trashed my <UNK> attempts at a blog on <UNK> .
it just was n't working out for me man .
"i suppose i could just link from that site to this <#> , but that 's a pain ."
i find myself contemplating <UNK> alpha <UNK> on ebay .
this is a dangerous hobby - i could end up with a <UNK> before you know it .
i spent a fair amount of time the last few days <UNK> with my friend <UNK> 's blogger template .
she is writing a book and wanted a page on the web describing her and her work in progress .
i <UNK> the pictures and placed them inside the template .
maybe i will edit this page 's template as well .
still no word from <UNK> about the ftp access .
i guess i will just have to switch to another system - or maybe another host for my web page
here 's a little story with a motto .
"since i share the water <UNK> with my <UNK> 's unit next door , i let her know ."
she agreed and went shopping for a new hot water <UNK> last week .
i came home last thursday and saw the old water <UNK> sitting in the <UNK> .
"i popped my head into the house and sure enough , a new water <UNK> was installed ."
it was all <UNK> and a little rusty on <#> side .
"i asked my <UNK> about it , and she said she bought this unit because it was <UNK> damaged but still worked just fine ."
and it was offered at a steep discount .
"well , over the weekend i still had no hot water ."
every time i mentioned this to my <UNK> she said the damn pilot kept going out .
"i probably <UNK> the stupid thing <#> times over the weekend , and still i had no hot water ."
"i <UNK> some more , and she agreed to call the company on monday ."
yesterday morning ( monday ) i was walking out to work when she grabbed me .
""" i 've found out why the water <UNK> keeps going out , "" she announced ."
"i 've tried getting a blog going on <UNK> several times , but dealing with the tech support there is like entering the fourth level of hell ."
"their ftp guy is a <UNK> , and he provides me no help at all ."
"oh well , you get what you pay for ."
- i pay dearly for my dsl through <UNK> ...
"my power was restored last thursday , water service has been good , and my cable tv came back on wednesday night ."
that first night back with the air conditioning was a very good thing .
"it has been so hot and <UNK> the past <#> weeks , not a breath of wind ."
"i cleared most of the remaining <UNK> from the yard last weekend , though i still have some wood that i need to burn ."
i decided to burn the <UNK> rather than carry it out .
i could n't believe the amount of email that was piled up from ten days of not checking it .
i ca n't imagine that anyone ever <UNK> to those things .
"anyway , here are some useful links to storm related sites ."
"by far the most useful is the urllink joint <UNK> warning center , a <UNK> outfit that actually <UNK> all the storm <UNK> for the pacific and indian <UNK> ."
"but another good site is the urllink national weather service - <UNK> office , which has a really good <UNK> radar image loop ."
that was <UNK> in the hours leading up to the storm .
watching the approaching <UNK> i knew it was going to be bad .
tomorrow morning i am coming in to move my computer and files into a new office .
i hope it does n't take too long .
"just finished listening to <UNK> 's <UNK> beyond and starting <UNK> <UNK> 's <UNK> <UNK> , white mountain journal in the cd player ."
nothing like a little slack key on a rainy friday afternoon .
well <UNK> <UNK> struck <UNK> early friday morning and <UNK> the island with wind up to <#> <UNK> .
"many lost their houses , the power <UNK> was <UNK> , phones are <UNK> , water is <UNK> and failing ."
"yesterday another <UNK> passed <UNK> , the second in <#> days ."
"<UNK> ha long passed <#> miles south of <UNK> , but the winds were still fierce and caused further damage ."
today is the first time i actually sat down in front of a computer in a week .
our office at work suffered moderate water damage when a section of the roof was torn off .
we had to <UNK> the entire building 's staff into temporary quarters while management searches for a new location for our offices .
i am currently <UNK> in an empty exam room with <#> others from my department .
"this area is full of people , but we are better off than some <UNK> ."
<#> entire <UNK> got <UNK> into <#> little store front over the weekend .
it looks like a can of human <UNK> in there .
the power is expected to be off for <#> - <#> weeks while the power <UNK> <UNK> lines and test <UNK> .
i am looking into purchasing a gas backup generator for my place .
suffice to say these items are in short supply right now and demand is high .
... it 's actually satisfying to do my job instead of all the shit labor moving furniture and files or clearing out my backyard .
"it should hit friday afternoon , which makes for a lousy weekend ."
time to go pull out the <UNK> <UNK> and get all the crap outside in the house .
"the rain finally stopped today , a little before noon ."
i went down to the beach and took a long walk in the sunshine .
"it just started raining again - a wet , <UNK> <UNK> ."
it looks like it will continue into the night .
"i am looking at a <#> day weekend , and that is a good thing ."
too bad the rain shows no sign of letting up .
it will stop someday - in january .
woke up this morning with urllink <UNK> curled up next to me .
"she 's a sweet little kitty , i do like having her around ."
"i had the chance to take urllink miles when mel first found him , and i passed it up ."
"hey , let 's try <UNK> a picture into this blog : let 's see if this works ."
it was a cheap price and i got <#> bonus miles for making the purchase online .
this is probably the third or fourth time i 've bought tickets off the internet .
i 've lost count of how many things i purchase online .
"i 've do my urllink banking online , i applied for and pay my urllink credit urllink cards online ."
i buy urllink <UNK> and manage my urllink <UNK> portfolio online .
i could not be who i am without the internet .
life on this island would be quite <UNK> indeed without the wonder of online shopping .
last year for christmas i got a couple people in my family gift <UNK> from amazon and a couple other online places .
they both expressed well fear and disappointment that i got them something they would have to <UNK> online .
they both asked the same question : is it safe ?
"that was a good question to ask in <#> , but in today 's world it marks my <UNK> as 21st century urllink <UNK> ."
i was <UNK> of placing orders online many years ago too ; in fact the first couple orders i placed i paid by check .
"but the <UNK> in shipping to <UNK> proved too great , and i switched to online <UNK> ."
now i do n't think twice about placing an order online - hell
i prefer the internet to <#> - <#> numbers .
especially since many companies use <UNK> as their urllink customer service <UNK> .
"giving my credit card number to an <UNK> <UNK> makes me nervous , not using <#> bit <UNK> <UNK> over the internet ."
"as promised , i found information on a nasa website concerning urllink lightning rates ."
they got a urllink satellite that measures this stuff .
there appears to be a strong <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and lightning flashes . and
<UNK> activity over the <UNK> is <UNK> lacking in this <UNK> <UNK> .
"hence i am not crazy , lightning really does flash more rarely on <UNK> than on the <UNK> ."
why the sudden <UNK> in lightning around <UNK> ? that 's a mystery to me still .
it is very unusual for <UNK> to get so much lightning .
"it rarely <UNK> on <UNK> , even during the height of rainy season ."
i am going to search about on the internet and see if i can get an answer to this question .
or perhaps i will seek the answer to the question 's opposite : why is there usually so little lightning and thunder on <UNK> .
i <UNK> to mozilla <#> after a couple hours last night .
"everytime i tried to exit the mozilla it would close , but when i tried to <UNK> the program i got nowhere ."
", twice , <#> times and i was tired of that behavior ."
sometimes it 's just better to ride behind the curve .
"today is another gloomy , wet and depressing day on <UNK> ."
"i know this is the rainy season , but i am tired of the rain ."
"i crave the sun , i want an absence of mud and mold and <UNK> ."
i feel like i am living in seattle or something .
just downloaded urllink mozilla <#> for my dell and my mac .
my hats off to the volunteers in this project . and
let me say that this <UNK> keyboard on my dell just sucks .
just finished up my lunch with this tasty new hot sauce i stumbled upon : urllink <UNK> 's kick it up green pepper sauce .
basically it 's the same thing as urllink <UNK> 's green pepper sauce .
both are made from urllink <UNK> and are more <UNK> than hot .
<UNK> adds a little zip to anything you put it on .
"i like hot <UNK> , most everything i eat is <UNK> with either <UNK> or some other hot sauce ."
my current favorites are from urllink dave 's .
dave 's insanity sauce is <#> righteous hot sauce .
i generally have a number of hot <UNK> going at <#> time .
"a couple weeks ago i came across another hot sauce i need to add to my collection , urllink quest for fire hot sauce ."
i would actually call this sauce a <UNK> or bbq sauce .
i think i need to get a jar and <UNK> some short ribs in this <UNK> <UNK> .
"a good <UNK> flavor , with just a bit of lip <UNK> heat ."
"to continue the <UNK> column - jesus leon <UNK> , founder of the urllink bank of <UNK> , passed away urllink yesterday at the age of <#> ."
"the cause of death was not stated , but i know he had cancer and his health was failing ."
he passed away at urllink <UNK> memorial hospital .
the singer urllink william <UNK> died on sunday in chicago .
"he was probably best known for singing "" old man river "" from urllink show boat ."
"he also defined the title role in urllink <UNK> and <UNK> , had a successful opera career and was a professor of music at <UNK> ."
seems like the radio has been alive with his music the past couple days .
"it is a <UNK> thing to listen to william <UNK> singing urllink aaron <UNK> 's version of urllink "" simple gifts . """
this summer has been <UNK> in <UNK> and urllink brutal <UNK> of young girls by urllink <UNK> and urllink homeless .
"is there a plague of urllink demons this summer , or is this just the latest urllink media frenzy ?"
"last summer it seemed like every week the media was reporting a new shark attack , this year urllink every week brings another <UNK> or murder ."
"some part of me <UNK> a purpose in these reports , like <UNK> up support for those new urllink <UNK> <UNK> tags ."
but that is simply too urllink <UNK> to believe .
"it 's getting a little <UNK> , but it sure ai n't cold anymore !"
"last week it was <UNK> in this building , today i am freezing ."
i guess all the rain and cool <UNK> outside have something to do with it .
i sure wish i was wearing a sweatshirt or something right now .
i finally located my date <UNK> yesterday in a box .
a quick review of the past couple weeks brought up several birthdays and <UNK> i missed .
so today a batch of <UNK> greeting cards is going out .
- i put all the dates into my <UNK> so it wo n't happen again .
"every relative , every friend , every wedding and anniversary is now recorded ."
"how i can have multiple computers , <UNK> programs , <UNK> 's , and a desk calendar ; yet still miss birthdays ."
just finished listening to a round of cd 's on the stereo .
started off with a burned mix of mp3 's from urllink <UNK> - <#> of the <UNK> of premium membership .
"followed up with the <UNK> apple 's second album , urllink when the <UNK> ... something or other ."
"finished the <UNK> of music with a bobby <UNK> and yo yo ma <UNK> , urllink <UNK> ."
"the last album did wonders to <UNK> my pounding headache , or maybe it was laying down and reading quietly for about an hour that did it ."
urllink <UNK> <UNK> - damn what a great tune .
time to take quick break and update on the old blog though .
ah the magic fingers of urllink vince urllink <UNK> .
just what i needed to hear on this afternoon .
gone off on a bit of a cooking spree this weekend .
"i have quite a bit of food in the fridge now , which will supply me with a number of nice <UNK> for the next week ."
all the managers that survived yesterday took a pay cut .
my boss made it clear that more of the <UNK> stuff would be falling on me know that he has <#> times as many people to command .
in a way i think this is kind of cool .
i can positively say that a couple of the folks let go on friday were total dead wood that should have been let go years ago .
"<#> of the women let go yesterday served absolutely no purpose in the company , none ."
she collected a paycheck and sat in her nice office doing nothing all day .
"on a lighter note , i sat through my first urllink fantasy football draft this morning ."
i signed up with a bunch of other guys that do this thing <UNK> .
"i more than <UNK> myself in the draft , signing up a well balanced <UNK> of guys that should do me proud as the season <UNK> ."
after the draft i went to the movies with a friend and checked out urllink signs with mel gibson .
"pretty good flick , though i was a expecting an alien invasion movie ."
"it was , but the movie was n't about aliens at all , it was about god ."
the lord works in mysterious ways - that 's what this movie was about .
"i thought the ending was <UNK> too . but all in all , it was an enjoyable way to pass the afternoon ."
"i do n't want to go into details , but there were a lot of <UNK> today - of management ."
"no rank and file employees were touched , just a pile of directors , managers and even vice presidents ."
"with this <UNK> of our management , the remaining managers suddenly found themselves in charge of multiple <UNK> across a broad range of areas ."
"i had a meeting for most of the afternoon with some of the <UNK> , and there was this <UNK> look in their eyes ."
sort of like they 'd been hit in the head with a <UNK> .
at least i still got a job for now .
i 'd better <UNK> my efforts to pay off my <UNK> and squirrel away as much cash as possible .
"with that thought in mind , i think i 'll skip <UNK> 's tonight - or maybe not ."
seems like i spend most of my time in either excel or access .
for some reason i stayed late at the office yesterday .
i had some tasks to finish up before this morning and i did n't get home until after 7:00 pm .
"i know several <UNK> , and they all agree that <UNK> got it totally wrong ."
", i completed at least <#> other books and started a fourth ."
i consider those books as taking a break from the serious book .
"i can usually polish <#> off in a day or <#> , while the more serious work takes a month or <#> ."
it was the same way with the <#> <UNK> mountain .
that book took me <#> months to read and i read <#> others during the same time frame .
"to finish off this train , i keep a list of what i read this year ( or is on deck to be read ) ."
"<UNK> , it is hot here in our temporary office space ."
the air <UNK> went crazy yesterday and today the problem is only worse .
"at best i would say it is <UNK> in this building , in my particular office it is <UNK> ."
"<#> computers , <#> <UNK> , <#> people in an <UNK> space makes for a <UNK> when the air conditioning is out ."
i might have to <UNK> out from work early if this continues .
i just ca n't <UNK> being in a meeting for <#> hours this afternoon and being this uncomfortable .
just got off the phone with a fellow in new jersey .
"after we concluded our business , out came the usual "" what time is it there ? "" questions ."
some people are just <UNK> by the fact that our planet is round .
and i live on the other side of it from the united states .
"think japan when you talk to somebody in <UNK> , we share the same time zone with tokyo for half the year ."
at least this guy called at a reasonable hour .
seems like most folks i deal with back there like to call during the middle of the night on <UNK> .
the usual <UNK> are telephone <UNK> at mail order outfits .
"they call during a convenient time for them , like 3:30 am <UNK> time ."
i once got a call from the vice president of a software company i was <UNK> to replace some legacy systems .
needless to say they did n't get the sale on that system .
<#> of the small <UNK> of living on <UNK> .
<UNK> ! forgot to do something before i went to bed !
"i just finished watching <UNK> , what a delightful movie ."
"i could tell the director also did that movie with urllink ron <UNK> a few years ago , the city of lost children ."
"though miles apart in mood and setting , they shared a wonderful sense of imagination ."
"i am glad i rented it , especially since it never made a <UNK> release on <UNK> ."
my urllink <UNK> was acting up yesterday .
"i really enjoy the little <UNK> , it 's really more of a palm sized computer than a <UNK> , but it can be <UNK> ."
"the backup battery <UNK> out yesterday afternoon , leaving me in a <UNK> during a meeting ."
the <UNK> completely froze and then refused to power up .
even <UNK> <UNK> in the power <UNK> it was acting <UNK> .
"i ended up <UNK> the internal memory of the little fella , then <UNK> from a backup ."
"speaking of <UNK> , i <UNK> need to backup all the data on my computer at work ."
"i am still trying to <UNK> what i lost , data updates , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"i think most of it has been replaced , so now is the time for a new backup ."
i 'll be working late tonight finishing up that task .
"i had a smashing headache for most of yesterday , along with a strong desire to just curl up in my bed and sleep for about <#> hours ."
just took some food and urllink <UNK> .
i still ca n't wait for december and the <#> towers .
"i liked the fellowship of the ring , but it is lacking the detail of <UNK> 's books ."
it 's sharing your troubles that makes them lighter .
now urllink this story about the urllink google <UNK> caught my attention this morning .
google has an updated version of the <UNK> available - it 's version <#>
the weekend <UNK> large in my thoughts right now .
this week has been killer - tons of work and now the accident to boot .
hell of a way to kick off my weekend .
well guess who was in an accident this morning on his way to work ?
damn ... fortunately it was just a <UNK> <UNK> .
"listening to the urllink world cafe , what a great show ."
"it is probably my favorite program on <UNK> 's public radio station , the wonderful urllink <UNK> ."
i can honestly say i never listen to anything but <UNK> on my radio dial .
"i was just listening to a story on urllink npr 's "" all things considered "" about a urllink <UNK> <UNK> ."
who cares what a <UNK> in the czech republic looks like ?
"i was hoping for some insightful thoughts into a <UNK> of the <UNK> orders , which have been so urllink <UNK> tested this year in the united states ."
"i paid particular attention since i just finished reading urllink thomas <UNK> , a <UNK> monk who was also a <UNK> writer and <UNK> ."
"oh , i had some tasty urllink spam for dinner ."
"spam stir fry with tomatoes , <UNK> , onions and mushrooms ."
that was real tasty on rice with some great <UNK> .
"<UNK> powerful things , but the <UNK> behind the <UNK> <UNK> me at times ."
i struggled for about <#> hours to nail <#> error that was tossing all my <UNK> into chaos .
i can go to sleep now and polish off the project first thing tomorrow at work .
urllink <UNK> 's is a really good restaurant .
"i 've been eating there for at least <#> years , and i love the food ."
"<UNK> and <UNK> are great <UNK> , and their brother sang is a good waiter ."
i noticed that i am writing about restaurants a great deal .
i will <UNK> to write about other topics in the future though .
"my father always said "" hard work and honest effort were there own rewards . """
"he repeated it like <UNK> when i was younger , along with "" tell all your troubles to jesus , he will listen to you . """
"<#> regular bits of wisdom from my dad , along with his financial advice : buy urllink <UNK> roll stock ."
it started raining a little after midnight and it was still going strong when i finally hit the sack .
funny how the sun was shining when i went into work a <#> hours later .
toss on a couple more must do assignments onto my pile .
"i used to call it a burden , now i call it job security ."
i am going to install that personal brain software on my machine at work though .
i must do something to manage all the <UNK> tasks i <UNK> daily .
i tried messing with the brain software over the weekend and it looks like something i can test drive . came home this evening to frustration .
the <UNK> hose was blocked so after struggling from the inside of the house i <UNK> outside .
"i pulled the hose out of the drain pipe , turned on my garden hose , and shot a blast of water up the <UNK> hose ."
that cleared it right out and now i am happy again .
my urllink <UNK> took off this morning for a week in <UNK> diving with the urllink blue <UNK> dive shop .
"this is the third trip this year , researching and diving in <UNK> with her book on the history of <UNK> <UNK> ."
"she left me with a couple chores to do in her absence , mostly dog or book related ."
", i get a great deal on the rent in return ."
i feel like <UNK> over to urllink jeff 's pirate 's <UNK> for a hamburger .
"he makes the best on island - that "" homemade "" <UNK> really hits the spot ."
"burger and a cold beer - man , i 'm outta here !"
"the sun is shining and the skies are clear now , but they were n't at 4:00 this morning ."
"i got up , looked outside and decided it was n't worth my time ."
the clouds were thick and <UNK> the entire sky .
"i will try again tomorrow morning , that is the actual <UNK> of the <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's water supply has been in <UNK> because of the <UNK> .
the low water pressure caused by the loss of electricity at the pump houses allowed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to slip into the public water supply .
most of the island remains under a boil water notice .
"even worse , several local bottled water <UNK> tested positive for e. <UNK> , including the water <UNK> that my office uses ."
"i do n't want <UNK> , and i certainly do n't want <UNK> ."
"been drinking a lot of beer , it 's as good a reason as any to drink ."
"for the past week , the <UNK> of a saint <UNK> the island of <UNK> ."
"<UNK> of <UNK> , known at the urllink little flower , visited churches throughout the island ."
"<UNK> was a <UNK> nun , so the sisters at the <UNK> mission on <UNK> actually came out of their <UNK> to attend mass ."
"the last time that happened was <#> , when pope john paul ii celebrated mass in <UNK> ."
"the little flower is a very popular saint among <UNK> worldwide , and many find inspiration in her example ."
tonight i plan on staying up late - or getting up very early .
urllink the <UNK> <UNK> shower should be reaching its <UNK> in the early morning hours of sunday morning .
"i could also do this on monday morning , but it 's just better to get up on sunday morning ."
"the weather has been pretty clear the last few days , so i am hoping for clear skies ."
"it seems like every year <UNK> is in a great position for the <UNK> <UNK> showers , but the weather is just <UNK> in november ."
i am hoping to get a good look at the <UNK> tomorrow morning .
hit urllink <UNK> 's place again last night .
met the boys from work and pulled numbers for the fantasy football draft .
"i 've never played fantasy football before , but i will hold my own with this group of guys ."
i need to spend some time putting together a draft order and game plan before the august <#> draft date .
that dude has been <UNK> for the longest time .
turns out he was on the annual summer tour of <UNK> asia .
he 's back to work at urllink st .
i left <UNK> 's early and went to urllink cost - u - less .
yesterday i was <UNK> around for something to eat for lunch .
"i fell back on <UNK> soup , but that is not my first choice for steady meals ."
i bought some nice <UNK> from the meat department .
"but i think i need something closer to what urllink <UNK> makes , urllink <UNK> ."
"instead of creating blogs , <UNK> <UNK> on creating and managing thoughts ."
the weblog feature of <UNK> is almost an <UNK> .
"what i really need is something to get a handle on the people , emails , projects , data and meetings i <UNK> during a typical day at work ."
"the mac is a luxury i come home to in the evenings , but that is just not the most creative or alert time of my day ."
"i just want to <UNK> after a long day at work , watch a little tv or browse the web briefly ."
i do n't have the time or energy to devote to something like <UNK> at home .
and i often do n't remember thoughts or <UNK> <#> hours after i wanted to write myself a little note about them .
"i am in information <UNK> , like so many other people today ."
"this company makes a very slick product , similar to <UNK> called the personal brain ."
i downloaded it today and i am going to give it a test drive at home .
"if i like it , i 'll probably install it on my machine at work"
so i can start to get a handle on the information i deal with everyday .
"slept late , ate a nice breakfast , read the paper , read a magazine , and i am doing several loads of laundry ."
makes me realize how much i do n't like <UNK> <#> months off of work was a real enjoyable time for me .
"anyway , if i get all my laundry and house cleaning done today i will have my entire weekend free and clear before me ."
"i have some home improvement projects that i need to resolve , more on those when they are finished ."
"oh yeah , today marks the <#> year anniversary of the big <UNK> ."
"august <#> , <#> ; an <#> <UNK> shook <UNK> silly ."
i was here that day and i will never forget it .
i have things to do tomorrow at work - lots of things .
"mostly boring meetings , but some work is needed before i go into these meetings ."
but i also have special <UNK> to take friday off and relax since last week was a bitch and
i know if i stay home tomorrow i will feel guilty - at least for a while .
so should i stay home and play <UNK> or come into work and be bored and pissed off that i came into work on a day
i am going to take tomorrow off and relax ...
my urllink dell <UNK> box suffered a horrible death yesterday .
turns out the is guys hooked up my <#> gig data drive to the wrong <UNK> <UNK> and the whole thing went <UNK> .
"and since that drive had all my data on it , i am pretty upset ."
"i 'm pretty upset , but it could have been a lot worse ."
"on the other hand , what could i expect ?"
"dell makes <UNK> computers , and the drive that went to the great digital heaven was a urllink western digital ."
""" dude , your getting a dell . "" uh oh ."
it was saturday and i was looking at a <#> day weekend .
but urllink <UNK> 's philly <UNK> is nasty .
i do n't think i 'll be eating there ever again .
i only ate there today because subway was incredibly slow and had a long line out the front of the store .
urllink subway 's sweet onion chicken <UNK> is a really tasty sandwich .
"though i prefer urllink <UNK> 's turkey bacon <UNK> , <UNK> 's is a farther drive from the office ."
"plus <UNK> 's is located next to ban thai , my favorite thai restaurant ."
"so if i make the haul all the way there , i usually end up eating thai food ."
i changed the template for this blog to something a little more pleasing to my eye .
since i am the only <#> reading this i figured i might as well make it good for me .
i was involved in my first high level <UNK> for our company and the government of <UNK> .
this happens every year and i always knew it to be a tense time for those involved .
"i was working non - stop last week , <UNK> out data and <UNK> like mad for the <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i can honestly say i do n't want to step foot inside the hotel <UNK> for another year .
too much time spent in anonymous <UNK> and <UNK> tables .
the weather on <UNK> has improved <UNK> the past week .
"sometimes it 's the little things that make life <UNK> . going to a <#> hour post office , mailing priority mail packages ."
"go there about 11:30 , make a quick stop at steak n shake on the way home , and hit the sack . soon ."
"ok , so on a couple of websites i shot my mouth off and said , "" i just do n't get this blogging thing . """
first of all i do n't understand what all the <UNK> is about .
"why are your run of the mill bloggers being treated like "" real "" journalists ?"
"having worked in the media for almost <#> years , i guess i still consider this sport like public access cable ."
"sure it helps further freedom of speech , sure it seems like fun , and sure other people can read your <UNK> if they so desire ."
"however , just because you have a website that has a high <UNK>"
is that enough to qualify you as a journalist ?
"here 's the problem see . just as with public access cable , you are free to <UNK> just about anything ,"
now here is where i have a problem of sorts .
"i was reading some of the blogs from the democratic convention , and let me just say i was less than impressed ."
some of them may have well been written by chairman of the democratic party himself .
"others just border on <UNK> , <#> fellow seems well on his way to a big fat <UNK> suit ."
"would it bother anyone to pick up a copy of the ap <UNK> manual and read it before claiming "" hey !"
"i 'm a blogger , i 'm a journalist ! !"
"i look at these blogs more like "" letter to editor "" pages in the local waste of a tree ."
"now granted , i am just <UNK> a toe into the water , so i am prone to changing my mind ."
"however as of right now i do not see what the big deal is , why i should care , or even why anyone should take blogs seriously ?"
"maybe i will find the answers to these questions , maybe not ."
but if i get bored with something i tune it out completely .
so do n't expect this thing to get updated very often .
"<#> years ago , i was voting for george w. bush to because i wanted to ."
i wanted to put an end to <#> years of clinton politics .
i wanted to put an end to al gore 's political career more importantly .
i 've been to the produce section of the grocery store
", i 've seen a few <UNK> in my time ."
"now i have always considered myself a very <UNK> republican or a right - wing democrat , your choice really ."
"i tend to vote for the best candidate for the job , if i ca n't determine who that is i vote republican ."
i figure things ca n't get much worse if the republican get 's the job .
"going into this <UNK> , i will say i did n't think much of the democratic <UNK> ."
"seems the only platform they were running on was , "" we 're not bush . """
of the runner - ups i thought the <#> guy who possibly could have <UNK> my vote from voting for <UNK> again was wes clark .
"possibly howard dean , but we all know he fell off the wagon ."
"i have no idea how john kerry <UNK> to the top , when he was <UNK> water with the likes of al <UNK> ."
so now here we have a guy who changes his position on the issues more often than he changes his underwear .
let 's hope that he does that at least once a day .
in this day and age we need a president that is strong .
we need a president that has the balls to do what needs to be done .
"hell if they put ronald <UNK> name on the ballot i 'd gladly vote for him , <UNK> he 's dead ! ! !"
"but , alas , i will vote for bush again , because , well "" he 's not kerry . """
"i just wish there was a <UNK> third party candidate , where 's ross <UNK> when you need him ?"
"moving right along beer drinking christians , dogs walking around , sitting around , <UNK> hanging out of windows eating bugs ."
it 's not all <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> is it .
i do n't even totally know what i 'm saying .
"this is our life - going around trying to see what we can see , as clearly as possible - to hear <UNK> - and still not totally knowing ."
"we 're finding out that we 're "" in process "" and do n't have to "" be there "" yet ."
we 're being on a journey and we 're finding partners to travel with .
we are learning that a thought process like that is total crap and we 're casting the crap aside .
did n't the <UNK> figure out long ago that you can have a beer and be a <UNK> of jesus at the same time ?
or is it just american <UNK> christians who have gotten hung up like that ?
"the newest wave of emerging church leaders , <UNK> <UNK> , etc ."
they do n't ( we do n't ) even recognize the <UNK> any more .
""" oh , we were supposed to be poured into some freakin ' mold and be like you guys - i 'm sorry . """
"we 're sorry , but we wo n't be poured ."
we wo n't be <UNK> - not by that .
"the dog story : a dog is walking down the road . as he walks , he notices that as he moves his feet the trees move ."
""" feet move , trees move ; feet move , trees move "" he thought to himself - he is happy , life is good ."
"then , after his walk , he sits down and starts to wonder over the events that just happened ."
"but , as he sits he notices that when his butt is down the trees stop moving ."
""" butt down , trees not move ; butt down , trees not move , "" he thought to himself - he is happy ."
"he thought to himself , "" my world is complete - legs move , trees move ; butt down , trees do n't move . """
he was happy - the world was good ; his life had meaning and he was off to the beach .
"the ride was long , and as the car was driving down the freeway the dog looked out the window - and his world fell apart before him ."
"his butt was down , but the trees were moving - this was impossible , and against all he knew - how could this be ?"
did you ever notice that some dogs riding in the back seat of a car just ca n't sit still as the car is moving ?
"that 's because , as long as they keep moving they do not need to <UNK> the world around them ."
"yea , it can get <UNK> , and on occasion we get a bug in the mouth -"
but it 's fun and we are loving it .
punk monkey just a little something i felt i needed to share from your friends at <UNK>
"hey alan , you guys drink beer ? !"
"we <UNK> also have good connections to <UNK> , to urllink manhattan <UNK> ."
"mike <UNK> , his wife <UNK> and others often visited us last years ."
"last visit has been at easter , at our annual leader meeting ."
"at our meeting <UNK> ( <#> of the guys who has been in <UNK> , see below ) told us from these guys in <UNK> ."
"he said , it 's exactly the same we have in germany - it 's just another language ."
"and it was very funny to hear of their festival , and to hear they called it <UNK> - similar to <UNK> ."
"i hope some day i can meet them , see what happens there ..."
"<UNK> last march , a group of young leaders met by the <UNK> to discuss the things the lord is doing among the youth in their nation ."
they looked at some of the ways people are doing church in new ways .
"<#> of the most significant <UNK> is led by <UNK> <UNK> who started a church named "" urllink rejected and <UNK> "" ."
they have planted <#> and are now serving a vision which seeks to reach all the <UNK> of their nation .
the event was attended by people from various other nations including <#> guys from the urllink jesus freaks in germany .
they were of great encouragement as they shared the ways they are making disciples .
"after this event , they all had a <#> day party ."
they called it urllink <UNK> and it was attended by over <#> people .
the youth in latin america is <UNK> the vision to reach the emerging generations in the <UNK> .
"for more in spanish , visit urllink <UNK> ."
a urllink friend who i work with and i have been frustrated over the price of what some <UNK> are charging for just basic worship and media images .
there is generic title slides ( <UNK> <UNK> have been taken out ) and some background slides ( for teaching and worship ) .
everything is free and we hope to add another <#> - <#> weeks of images a year .
"if you know of any churches that are struggling in the area of media images , let them know of the site ."
i 'm still too busy to research all of them out there .
<#> of these days i 'll get to visit every site listed at urllink social software .
but by then something new will take over . ....
"let 's see if this "" blog by e - mail "" <UNK> works ."
"( get a <UNK> account ! ) if you want to know more about the hosting field in general ( e.g. experiences , tech issues , etc . )"
returned from the urllink air conference in boston this week .
"presented my urllink <UNK> of q <UNK> and was able to attend quite a few other interesting sessions on <UNK> , <UNK> , survey techniques and other <UNK> topics ."
( the day after returning another <UNK> flight from cleveland to boston received a military <UNK> due to a mistaken transmission made by the pilot . )
much larger in scope and size than the urllink peter b. lewis building he designed for urllink case .
"this is , of course is in response to google whose urllink gmail software was also recently <UNK> ."
"gmail , <UNK> , offers <#> gb of storage ."
( little did i know my yahoo account was <UNK> because ( probably ) of <UNK> . )
( of course the yahoo mailbox is older but i rarely gave the address to anyone . )
this experiment will measure the quality of each services spam - <UNK> software and compare the messages that get through to each .
perhaps not a very scientific study - especially since i 'm <UNK> it here - but maybe there will be something of interest that <UNK> .
earlier this year a urllink mailing list about <UNK> that i stated with a fellow runner had its <UNK> anniversary .
ten years on the same software ( urllink <UNK> ) and same host ( urllink <UNK> college . )
"blogs and easy to use software like urllink contribute allow anyone - yes , anyone - to publish on the web ."
( this will happen in october according to the <UNK> release .
( this urllink older article reminds us of how long it 's been since the <UNK> first started . ) tonight i ( <UNK> this convenience <UNK> .
( the book is important and i 've already been looking for the book for a couple days .
( this should n't be a surprise for a textbook . )
they had several copies for $ <UNK> ( and a buy it now <#> for $ <#> or $ <#> . )
i went to <UNK> and found <#> for under $ <#> which i reserved and will hopefully get by early next week .
the urllink guide to <UNK> schools from the university of virginia offers a good <UNK> to <UNK> schools in both of these forms of alternative education .
"in today 's world , the medium can offer a lot in terms of convenience to the non - traditional student seeking to extend his or her education ."
found a new set of web tools that i 'll be using on some sites i 'm working on .
urllink <UNK> seems to feature a lot of stuff that can be <UNK> in your own pages and also services ( often free ) for hosting other features .
"as the summer gets into full swing , i 've decided to make a serious attempt to get ( back ) into decent running shape ."
"at the end of the month , the urllink <UNK> , will take place in <UNK> , oh ."
"this is the 11th running and the first as an actual "" race "" ."
i was the <UNK> for the first ten years and it was more of a low key run .
this represents a full <UNK> of my race directing responsibilities having handed over management of the urllink <UNK> <#> last year .
i hope to start a new ultra race or <#> in the next couple of years .
there are communities on virtually ( no pun intended ) every topic .
"however , with the ability for anyone to start their own community , there often exist <UNK> groups with little <UNK> ."
the process of <UNK> invitations seems to work well to reduce the amount of noise and eliminate spam .
"( i 'm not sure how <UNK> are dealt with - e.g. <UNK> <UNK> , posts removed , etc ."
"of course i bought my invitation off of ebay for a couple dollars , but that 's beside the point ."
i 've had my account for about <#> weeks now and not a single spam .
i figured that i would have received at least a couple <UNK> by now .
but i guess that whatever google is not on the anti - spam side seems to be working .
attended the urllink <UNK> conference last week with my wife <UNK> who did a presentation on urllink virtual field trips .
first time to the french quarter and urllink <UNK> st .
( but the music seems to only be either <UNK> or bad <#> 's top <#> . )
never been to such a hot and humid place .
( though cleveland has its occasional times . )
"of course , these sites work if the employer posts their <UNK> to these national sites ."
"for those who want to search multiple <UNK> sites , you can download and install these urllink php scripts and load them on your own server ."
( the result will be something like urllink this . )
the <UNK> <UNK> my order and i watched the <#> people in back of me get their drinks first .
"seated near the day 's newspapers i stumbled across a recent business book ( the <#> individual ) with a sticker on it saying "" i 'm free "" ."
the idea is for people to freely get rid of books they do n't want by leaving them at places like starbucks .
"their site also allows you to do a <UNK> hunt , of sorts ."
you can look for what books are possibly available in your area and where .
let 's see if they 're around in a year or <#> .
was the <UNK> 's error just fate that allowed me to discover this new service ?
"i do n't know , but they did give me a <UNK> for a free drink at my next visit because of the <UNK> ."
"( and , no , i did n't complain to anyone to get the <UNK> . )"
"while watching my daughters today at the local playground , i read the newest issue of urllink <UNK> , a magazine about the use of technology in higher education ."
as my urllink last entry points out something needs to be done to make online courses easier to create and more functional for the <UNK> .
"an an "" expert system "" for <UNK> ( have n't heard that term for a while )"
a <UNK> would <UNK> the mundane tasks and help add better organization and content to an online course .
let 's see if this idea ever takes off ....
"finally had a chance to <UNK> a little around mit 's new open source course management software , urllink <UNK> ."
( you can login to a demo site at the home page or <#> of several test site urllink here . )
"information about the benefits of <UNK> ( and web services , in general ) are located in this urllink word file ."
we drove around the city looking for houses for sale .
"saturday our agent sent a short list of homes for sale , <#> of them not even built yet ."
"we looked at <#> properties on sunday , and are <UNK> to make an offer on a <#> built home ."
"there are several more houses on our ' must see ' list , but i have the feeling that we will buy new ."
what that means for me is <UNK> i 'll be able to install cat <#> ( <UNK> ) cable throughout the house before the walls go in .
tonight we 'll see that last few houses and make a choice ... if all goes to plan ...
if i sounded a bit depressed yesterday it was because our selling price was too low .
"well , it turns out that i did n't take into account how much he had paid off on our present mortgage since the beginning of this adventure ."
the big advantage to taking a whole year to sell your house is that in the meantime you 've made a whole year of payments on your present house .
our initial goals are still on track because of this .
"well , i 'm sitting here celebrating with a <UNK> and a bowl full of nuts ."
the cause for celebration is that we sold our house ... finally .
"we first put it on the market , let 's see ... about <#> months ago ? where is this <UNK> market we heard about ?"
seems to me that the housing <UNK> is not nearly as desperate as we were led to believe .
"anyways , the condition on the offer was met , and the <UNK> 's financial institution 's <UNK> is coming tomorrow ."
"i am not totally happy with the offer , but what can i do now ?"
"cut corners , compromise , eat <UNK> for a few months ."
the fun part is that we get to start house hunting in <UNK> tomorrow .
i 'm just looking forward to getting into a bigger house and the opportunity to <UNK> boxes that have been <UNK> in the basement for the last <#> years .
"well , yesterday was the big <UNK> with the big honey ."
we changed the spelling of honey to distance ourselves from the origin of the word : <UNK> - the - <UNK> .
"in tribute to the original use of the <UNK> , we re - <UNK> it the big honey ."
"anyways , there is a new blog dedicated to the big honey and those that will use it ."
the original <UNK> and storage for the pictures is in urllink my <UNK> .
thanks again to the urllink <UNK> honey farm for <UNK> the old <UNK> .
"today is the <UNK> "" smoke "" with dry - rubbed <UNK> back ribs ."
"once the urllink big <UNK> honey has a chance to cool down , we will empty <#> cans of black high - heat stove paint on it ."
i could spend more than that on a suite of <UNK> products ...
"anyways , some background : we have been trying to sell our house since fall <#> ."
then we changed the factors that we could to generate interest : we lowered our asking price by $ <#> and we started fixing up the joint .
"we got a <UNK> offer in march or april , subject to the <UNK> of a building <UNK> ."
"he could not recommend the house , so the <UNK> backed out ."
"we fixed up the house some more by replacing the worst <UNK> areas on the roof , and overnight the <UNK> <UNK> to pick up ."
within a week ( today in fact ) we got our second offer .
lower than we expected anyone would even dare offer .
"we <UNK> with $ <#> more , and they accepted within several hours ."
now their only contract out is if the <UNK> is in such bad shape it needs replacing .
stay posted to find out how our house - selling saga ends .
this urllink calendar and urllink web color pre - <UNK> are contest entries for web pages under <#> <UNK> ...
everything you ever wanted to know about canadian grain from my current employer : the urllink canadian grain commission
some of my geek friends and i have decided to get into the shop and get our hands dirty .
"we concluded that if our wives could have countless ' girls night out ' 's , then the men were entitled to a weekend to ourselves ."
"for a glimpse of what we are attempting to build , see : urllink the big baby ."
the <UNK> is a bust though as the wives made their own plans again and left us men with the kids .
we 'll have to do it after bed - time .
another issue i have came to light today while i was <UNK> the contents of my pockets .
"among the bits of paper , post - it <UNK> and <UNK> , were some brand new yet <UNK> up $ <#> and $ <#> bills ."
"now what is keeping me from <UNK> these things in my wallet , where they belong ?"
"the answer , of course , is because that my wallet no longer fits in my pocket ."
if you have <#> credit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> member <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cards ... you already have <#> inch of your wallet <UNK> .
on top of that i have the ( much smarter ) thin plastic <UNK> public library <UNK> plan cards ( at least <#> or <#> of <UNK>
"<UNK> few pictures of the <UNK> ( my own , not the guess girls ..."
"cd 's , popcorn , power juice , coffee , haircut , car wash , film developing ... etc ."
in the end i have room for everything except money .
i do n't see why companies could n't offer <UNK> stickers instead of full sized credit cards for <UNK> and ' <#> free with <#> ' offers .
"air miles , the library , chapters , and my health plan could all be stuck on the same card ."
those forward thinking companies ( like <UNK> ) that accept my phone number instead of a <UNK> are even better .
those cards i can leave at home or in my wife 's purse .
do you think that <UNK> of course ) and <UNK> ) are aware of this problem ?
"whoa , i just ran <#> miles [ <UNK> ] ."
maybe they can be <UNK> out with a hot shower .
last week i thought i 'd die after <#> mile .
"it ai n't much , but am improving ."
gotta go now and log my progress at runner 's world 's urllink free training log .
"i was supposed to go running friday and sunday , but i was not able to get out ."
"instead , i decided to <UNK> part of my house ."
my brother came over saturday and helped me out ( with his <UNK> <UNK> ) and we got half of the job done .
"now my hands feel like <UNK> , and every muscle in my body is screaming for a- <#> ."
"i did n't run , but i feel like i got a workout ."
"after a few finishing touches , i 'll be ready to do the back roof next saturday ."
all this just so we can sell the house .
haha ... huge water - main break at <UNK> and water today ( that 's close to <UNK> bridge ) .
cars of all sizes are pushing through water up to <#> feet deep .
the only stall was a <UNK> in his fancy <UNK> .
if this blog had a theme it would have to be that .
"there will be a good long rant coming about the quality of service in the retail and so - called service <UNK> , but first lets talk about today ."
tons of wet snow has been falling since late last night and the city is dripping .
"this morning , as each of my coworkers arrived at work , they took their turns describing the fights they had with their significant other ."
throughout the day these normally good <UNK> people proved how <UNK> they can get .
"granted , we are not supposed to have <UNK> in the month before june ... but it happens ."
this <#> is just a little warmer and <UNK> .
it 's no reason to <UNK> around and <UNK> .
we do n't even go outside for heaven 's sake .
"<UNK> 's blog is active may <#> , <#>"
"the <UNK> wanted to see the inside of the house yesterday , so they called us up ."
"we met them there last night , got a key from the show home , and took a peek ."
all the wood trim and oak <UNK> door is installed .
it was supposed to be the same as all the other hilton homes ... a darker cream color .
we told the <UNK> and they are looking into it .
"while we had the <UNK> key , we stole a look at the neighbors house across the street ."
it is identical to ours but a little further along .
"their basement is poured and their <UNK> , lights , some <UNK> is installed , and their paint is the right color ."
"i <UNK> my plans for the basement , and janet and her mother agreed with them ."
all systems are ' go ' and the hi - <UNK> basement planning pushes forward .
right color ( in the neighbors house ) : wrong color :
sunday was a day of fun for the kids .
the red river ex -- a <#> day fair and amusement park -- is in town .
we borrowed a key and took a peek at our house again on saturday ( june <#> ) .
"now the inside <UNK> is completely finished and <UNK> , ready for painting ."
"the front concrete steps were poured yesterday and the interior <UNK> ... door and window trim , wall caps , <UNK> , were brought in for installation ."
i ran the <UNK> run available - the <#> mile <UNK> - <#> of a marathon .
the guys are <UNK> up for another marathon in walker north dakota in fall .
i have agreed [ in principle ] to join a relay team and run <#> miles .
time will tell if i can <UNK> recover from my <#> mile ordeal .
"my official time was <UNK> , but that was from when the gun went off ."
i spent several minutes <UNK> the crowd to the start line after the gun fired .
my watch time from <UNK> to finish was <UNK> .
after the marathon we had a little birthday party for : janet told him that we were singing happy birthday for him .
a few moments into the song he asked her who we were singing happy birthday for ...
"it 's not his memory , it 's his hearing ."
i do n't believe he has any batteries in that hearing aid .
on thursday the inside walls of the new house were covered .
our new home is beginning to take shape .
on friday the wall guys started <UNK> and <UNK> and added the rounded corners . also on thursday
", we picked the lighting <UNK> that will go into the house ."
all of the interior lights will be of [ <UNK> ] italian ( <UNK> ) glass with <UNK> hardware .
"tomorrow is the <UNK> marathon , and then a <UNK> for father 's day and my grandpa 's birthday ."
do n't ask me how old he is ... i 've lost track .
"maybe "" <UNK> - well "" would be a better way to put it ."
we choose carpet and <UNK> <UNK> colours for the new house .
i <UNK> the cable holes for my future <UNK> integrated network
"[ i found out that <#> <UNK> drill battery lasts for <#> - <#> <#> "" holes through a <UNK> , and <#> layers of <UNK> ] ."
"i found plans for the house in the house , that some <UNK> left behind when he was done ... so i <UNK> them into my computer ."
i can now plan our basement layout with more <UNK> .
"the house now has <UNK> , <UNK> and brick installed ."
the rough <UNK> electrical and <UNK> has been <UNK> and the walls are ready to be covered .
the doors and windows are installed and the garage floor is poured .
what a rush ! the last time i posted was a week ago .
what has happend in the <UNK> days might qualify as the biggest rush in recent memory .
"as i expected , we decided to buy a brand new house ."
"we offered a little more , and added a lot more ' built - <UNK> ' than the original price offered ."
"for example , we asked for all <UNK> to be included in the asking price , as well as air conditioning and some <UNK> ."
"the <UNK> counter offered $ <#> more , and we <UNK> again ... to meet him half way ."
"my dad , a <UNK> for many years , came and looked at it , and gave me a few points to complain about ."
it took a while but i 'm back online .
"our internet service was installed into our new house on saturday , but i just got the <UNK> to the computer hooked up now ."
the <UNK> was not interested in doing that for me since he had never seen a <UNK> <UNK> * box before .
"neither have i , which is why it took me till now ."
this is a picture of my <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> ( before <UNK> ) : the move <#> <UNK> south went amazingly smoothly .
"i got an early start by loading all of my books magazines , <UNK> , etc . early in the morning ."
"as soon as the sun hit us the temperature <UNK> to <#> c , so the early start saved my life ."
i 'm sure i would have had heat stroke if we started later .
our u - haul with arizona plates had to be <UNK> twice .
"the u - haul guy later told me the battery was brand new , so the charging system must be <UNK> ."
no problem though ... we all know how to boost cars in the great white north .
we had just the right <UNK> of <UNK> over to help us .
"not so many we tripped over ourselves , but not so few we had to do it alone ."
"at noon there was a <UNK> of people , so we got fresh muscles to do the heavy lifting ."
"i must have drank ( <UNK> ? ) a couple <UNK> of water that day , but i made not <#> trip to the toilet ."
we <UNK> all of the basement boxes into our new garage .
it will be a while till we can afford <UNK> to <UNK> it all .
"everybody workin ' , no <#> to take pictures ..."
this is all we have for moving day pictures ...
i guess it is now officially wednesday july <#> .
this afternoon we see the bank to sign mortgage papers . then tomorrow we get an ' official ' <UNK> at the new house .
... then we see the lawyer 's assistant to sign papers .
"next morning , friday , we see the lawyer again to collect the front door key ."
the house as of july <#> ... <#> days before possession day : our current basement :
<#> working day until vacation time ! today i felt much better .
"now since janet is at work all day , and the kids are at the grandparents , i just might go shopping ."
did i hear home depot is having a <#> % off sale ?
mac users might find this of interest : urllink <UNK>
"<#> working days till vacation ! <#> days after wisdom - tooth surgery , and my face is still swollen ."
i have <#> <UNK> of <UNK> ( mood - improving ) drugs left .
the stitch - holes feel <UNK> and sore ... like i bit both cheeks really hard .
i can not eat fast enough to get full so i have a <UNK> hunger - headache .
the ' pain ' was really far from it .
i felt no real ' pain ' from the missing teeth .
the real <UNK> is the <UNK> around the <UNK> and the burning around the stitches when i try to eat .
i have nothing to complain about and i think the procedure went <UNK> well .
now i am waiting for the stitches to <UNK> so the holes can heal over .
"ha ha . without functional cheeks to position food between my <UNK> , i ended up <UNK> most of the pieces whole ."
"new in the house today : bathroom <UNK> , <UNK> basic home network media panel ."
kitchen sink : bathroom <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> panel :
<#> news items : the incredible progress made in the new house earlier this week ; and my wisdom tooth removal this afternoon .
<UNK> and carpet : <UNK> for window <UNK> :
"last time we looked ( on saturday ) , they had just poured the basement floor and moved some wall materials into the basement ."
"they had <UNK> installed the kitchen <UNK> <UNK> in the bathrooms , and had correctly installed the <UNK> for the carpet ."
there must have been <#> different sub - <UNK> at the house during those <#> days .
on the way out we also noticed that the garage door was installed .
my bottom <UNK> : <UNK> tooth ( <UNK> ) removal ...
"i was scheduled for <UNK> pm , but the queue was pushed back for a few hours ."
"i got out of surgery at 3:30 , and janet picked me up at 4:00 ."
"the drugs they gave me put me to sleep ( or rather , i just fell asleep , since i stayed up till <#> am last night ..."
"i wanted to fall asleep on the table ) , but i did wake up in the middle of the third tooth ."
"i tried to yell "" you got the wrong tooth "" ... twice , but both times they told me to try not to talk : ) ..."
"i honestly thought they were <UNK> on my second <UNK> , not the third ."
"in the 4th to 5th hours , the freezing wore off , and the new dose of <UNK> had n't kicked in yet the pain was ... <UNK> ..."
i suppose <#> years of treating <UNK> with <UNK> with <UNK> ( <UNK> 's ) has made me a little <UNK> of the drug .
i 'm taking <UNK> 's now and they 're not having the desired effect .
"i 'll have to increase the dose , or put them closer together ."
"all in all , i am pleased that the surgery went quickly , and that there was no nerve damage of any kind ."
"<UNK> for wednesday , july <#> <#> ^^ <UNK> ( ) <UNK> with our <UNK> ( ) <UNK> and come up with a plan ."
<UNK> <UNK> do the same with their <UNK> ^^ <UNK> ( ) ( ) <UNK>
<UNK> why my meeting might be a complete waste of time ?
"^^ <UNK> ( ) <UNK> , lots of them , ( )"
<UNK> but <UNK> planning to <UNK> spring them on you during your performance review .
"although the official possession date for the new house is july <#> ( <#> weeks minus <#> days ) , an they may let us in a week early ..."
"next weekend is my urllink weekend of pain , so i 'm not expecting to do much more than lie on the sofa and watch tv ."
that would leave a week or <#> before the big day .
"packing is going well , but i feel like i 'm living in a warehouse ."
"the basement is <UNK> we looked on wednesday , and there was that pile of <UNK> that was being used to support the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"they must have brought the crushed rock on thursday , packed it down , and then poured the floor on friday ."
now it is ready to walk on and the <UNK> and <UNK> work can be installed .
we had been talking to the <UNK> about installing the deck - <UNK> at the back of the house .
"the <UNK> treated rot - <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> to the outside wall , and is used to secure the deck to the house ."
"this board does not come standard with the house , so we were going to have to pay for it ."
<UNK> we could install it ourselves after the <UNK> is on the house .
"this would involve a lot of <UNK> removal , or an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the outside of the <UNK> ."
the price was $ <#> for a <#> foot deck - <UNK> .
"we were going to pay it , but then remembered that the <UNK> forgot to install a small <#> foot wall between the living room and the front entrance ."
"although we like the <UNK> , we used it to trade for a deck - <UNK> ."
we visited the house and <UNK> the new changes .
the <UNK> guy was there so the doors were open .
we are pleased with the new kitchen colors and the paint job .
new kitchen : new paint job right color : becky in the big house :
last night was the last fireworks display we will get to enjoy from the comfort of home .
"yesterday was canada day and the evening fireworks take place in the middle of town , <#> blocks away and across the river ."
"this year was more <UNK> than ever , with <#> displays taking place on either side of ' the <UNK> ' where the <UNK> meets the red river ."
"becky says "" happy birthday canada "" , and jenny says "" thanks , canada for the beautiful fireworks "" ."
"fireworks canada day , <#> from the kids bedroom window today the <UNK> are fixing the mistake made last week in our new house ."
"i do n't know who made the <UNK> , nor do i care to know ."
"our <UNK> were also installed today , and they are <UNK> the basement for the pouring of the concrete ."
who - hoo ! we are finally able to park in the garage .
i have officially finished moving everything into the house that belongs in the house .
the only junk left in the garage is future shed and yard stuff and <UNK> stuff .
"the basement is now a little crowded and <UNK> , but that will change as we <UNK> ."
"this a.m. as i walked to the bus - stop in the dark , i heard a blood <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i looked in the direction of the scream , but saw nothing ."
the second <UNK> came from behind me so i knew that what i had heard the first time was an echo off of a house in front of me .
"i looked back toward my house , and sitting on our neighbors roof was an <UNK> sitting at least <#> feet tall ."
"for my benefit the <UNK> stretched his wings , and jumped off of the roof and landed on a roof closer to my position ."
"i took out my camera with the intention of shooting the <UNK> if it flew over me , but i did n't get the chance ."
"this would be the second <UNK> i have seen since moving to this area , the first being a deer on the <UNK> tracks ."
"the day has come ... after returning from grandpa 's lovely funeral , we discovered that our driveway had been poured ."
this marks an end to the muddy feet that come from little feet slipping into the <UNK> between construction site sidewalk blocks .
"driveway form , tuesday august <#> : poured driveway , august <#> ( color cast due to evening light )"
yesterday at <UNK> am grandpa went to his reward and <UNK> grandma .
"we <UNK> have ' missed ' grandpa ( henry f <UNK> of <UNK> ) ever since his hearing went , and will miss him even more now ."
"at the age of <#> , grandpa ( at his birthday party above ) suffered a ' silent ' heart attack , a condition only diagnosed after blood tests ."
"after a brief recovery , he developed <UNK> and died <UNK> august <#> <UNK> am ."
"<#> was a mild <UNK> , and the other was <UNK> hot chili peppers ."
"all was fine and dandy until , on the drive home , i absent <UNK> rubbed my left eye ."
i 'm glad the deer decided to stay in the fields tonight .
i would not have seen them on the road .
"btw , thanks d for letting me use your only cup , and sit in the <UNK> chair ."
"wow , what an eventful week so far ..."
jenny turned <#> and got her new bike on sunday .
i immediately put training wheels on the new bike and took the training wheels off of the old small bike .
<#> days later -- jenny is driving the old small bike [ without training wheels ] <UNK> .
we had no part in teaching her how to drive a bike .
"the next day [ sorry paul , you 're too late ... ] becky lost her second front tooth in a week ."
guess what 's all she wants for christmas now ?
"everything we want to keep is moved out , the final meter readings were made , lawn <UNK> for the last time , and the keys left behind ."
"good luck to the <UNK> , the new owners as of tomorrow morning ."
everybody welcome jenny to the <#> year old club .
"both achieved the same day , august <#> , <#> !"
"paul bought a house , paul bought a house ..."
"( sing to the tune of nya , nya nya , nya , nya )"
we 've been in the house for a week now .
so far there have been a few surprises .
"for starters , and to our complete surprise , a garage door <UNK> was not included in the price of the house ."
"as it happened , we went to the <UNK> website and got their top - of - the - line model for a cut - price ."
at least $ <#> less then the competition name brand [ that probably made the <UNK> model ] .
"it came with <#> <UNK> , a wall switch , <UNK> beam safety feature , and an external <UNK> entry system ."
"next , a hand rail for the basement stairs fell off the wall at a moment when i was depending on it greatly ."
"it was glued to the paint , and <UNK> with screws so short that the tips only just barely <UNK> the underlying wood <UNK> ."
i replaced those screws with ones <#> inch longer . then ...
someone brought us red wine for a <UNK> gift ...
then proceeded to spill some on the carpet ( see our carpet color in the archives ) .
"the ladies poured their own white wine on the red spill , and <UNK> it enough to remove the marks with <UNK> and water ."
i think there is now a light spot on the floor .
( and then i burned the steak while showing the guys the rest of the house ( namely the basement ) .
"there was only <#> steak , so it was n't missed ) ."
"at this rate the house will look totally lived - in in a few weeks , then we wo n't have to worry about it any more ."
"the time is <#> , <#> - <#> a.m. -- the temperature is minus <#> degree <UNK> ."
this morning is the first time this season i 've seen the temp drop to below freezing .
we 're still waiting for the <UNK> guys to do our house ... and the <#> neighbors around us .
yesterday we installed a few curtains and a basement <UNK> <UNK> .
"with any luck i 'll get a urllink <#> "" <UNK> > before winter storms in ."
we have a lot of furniture and <UNK> to build to make our new house a home !
b <UNK> headache at work the last few days .
last minute changes leading to <UNK> failure throughout all of our systems .

after <#> days of overtime and <UNK> days off we have finally caught the tiger by the tail .
"to remain positive , we have <UNK> the theme song from the kids show ' bob the <UNK> '"
i added <#> moving day pictures to the post of <#> .
i could not believe how hot and tired i got that day .
i do not want to do that again in the near future .
i just changed to a more space - efficient blogger template .
"sorry to you who need reading glasses to see the new text size , but i was always bothered by the <UNK> <UNK> of the other template ."
"if you feel <UNK> , you can always review the archives , which i will leave alone ."
now i 'll have to re - do my <UNK> ...
"update for september <#> , <#> : todays news is that there is no news ."
i did not fill up the film containing the photo of <UNK> ( see the sept .

"he simply said , "" we 're not going to do that . """
"with just a <UNK> of smile , he answered , "" because we want to punish the democrats , we want to hurt them , wound them . """
there was a long silence and the conversation was over .
"oh , geez ... my bumper sticker for ralph nader this year :"
"so , it could be that you do n't know about all the urllink controversy about <UNK> 's ( and others ) voting machines ."
perhaps you did n't hear that the ceo of <UNK> -- a prominent republican -- <UNK> to urllink personally deliver ohio 's electoral votes to bush .
but urllink this guy has put together an <UNK> - like set of <UNK> <UNK> ads that has had me laughing until i 'm about to bust something .

i 'll tell you if anything comes of it .
"even before john <UNK> published this , he 's been my favorite political <UNK> ever since i started paying attention to his website after <#> ."

that this is the <UNK> couldn’t be more clear : if mr .
"<UNK> john <UNK> : “ in virtually every state <UNK> , the <UNK> of support are remarkable ."
"kerry scores nearly or above <#> % support among democrats , while bush claims the same <UNK> among republicans ."
both candidates are gaining the same advantages among <UNK> ( kerry ) and <UNK> ( bush ) .
"what can you do for these families ? """
"it was good to hear you say that you want to fund <UNK> , daycare options , and intervention programs -- on behalf of all working families ."
"i also wonder , myself , if it is n't time for us to institute full - day school for most grades ."
"other parents work odd hours , and need better and cheaper daycare options ."
it 's that much harder for single parent families where there is only <#> income from which to <UNK> <UNK> payments .
but i 'd like to bring up a deeper issue here .
"we have a new tradition , and a new norm ."
"single parent <UNK> are a silent <UNK> in <UNK> life , especially low income single parents ."
"you will rarely see these families represented at the <UNK> , on the school board , <UNK> before city council , active in <UNK> and <UNK> affairs ."
what do we do with our children while we go to a meeting that runs past bedtime ?
how can we maintain the energy to put back into our community when we are trying to earn an income and be fair to our children ?
all these circumstances are as <UNK> as lack of <UNK> access to public buildings -- but they <UNK> over <#> in <#> parents .
"when i was growing up , our idea of how to live was just different ."
"in my own family , my mother never worked full time ."
my father raised <#> children and supported a wife on a rural minister 's salary .
"we lived <UNK> , but we owned a <#> room house with a big yard , and we had a new car every <#> years or <UNK> ."
"i did n't know my family was "" working poor "" -- we were well educated people accepted in middle class professional circles ."
this was a world where my mother was a full time mom and a key volunteer in so many church and other projects .
"she and many other ladies in our little town of <UNK> , <UNK> were always doing something to make our community better ."
women 's lives held our community together in a way that does n't happen anymore .
folks like robert <UNK> have commented on this .
"if you want to see a stronger america , find a way to bring working parents back into <UNK> life ."
sometimes i feel like the media has stolen the dignity of single parent families and the working poor .
"please think about these things , <UNK> , in your policy , and in the compassion you must maintain in the face of the huge <UNK> of your office ."
remember the people like me and my son who are <UNK> time we can ill afford to help you gain high office .
<#> of his <UNK> liberal friends thinks that any political or social opinion that <UNK> with a church is subject to rude <UNK> .
"his friend writes : sorry , i must have missed something ."
"these groups have always acted , often very <UNK> and quietly , to improve the lives of people around the globe ."
"they may have very strongly <UNK> internal political and social messages , particularly on political issues that avoid partisan politics ."
"however , all these organizations <UNK> in the amount of demonstrated faith they require of the <UNK> ."
a catholic or salvation army shelter may require <UNK> at services .
a <UNK> <UNK> soup kitchen or friends medical service corps may not .
", the idea of faith motivation <UNK> <UNK> - like <UNK> to some church authority 's agenda ."
"there 's very little understanding that many of us ( duh ) draw our liberal values , our progressive values , from our faith ."

"jim <UNK> , chair of the <UNK> democrats , and i made a field trip today to the <UNK> county elections office ."
"a <UNK> board is <UNK> with public notices , county job postings , and important dates ."
"overall , the first impression is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
but the people here work with a <UNK> in their eye this time of year .
"last week was the election , and the counts for the more prominent elected offices have long since been announced ."
but there 's an important ballot count still going on in the basement .
dull concrete floors are <UNK> with filing <UNK> and document <UNK> .
"in <#> corner , about ten long <UNK> tables are set up , perhaps <#> or <#> in use ."
this is where the <UNK> effect falls away .
"somehow i had expected computer <UNK> , cube walls , bright expensive offices , <UNK> young professionals <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i feel like i 've come through a very pleasant time <UNK> , far from the <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> 's voting machines ."
"<#> by <#> , tick mark by tick mark , our volunteers are elected by their neighbors . here in portland"
", the <UNK> worker is the lowest ranking elected official of the political system ."

"each <UNK> might have a maximum of <#> or so <UNK> workers , <UNK> divided between male and female <UNK> posts ."
"( yes , i had a problem with the <UNK> too ... )"
"we walk our <UNK> <UNK> voters , <UNK> people to vote , <UNK> our neighbors on candidates and ballot measures ."
"in portland , some <UNK> are almost <UNK> seats ."
"generations of families share the <UNK> <UNK> , sometimes multiple generations out of single <UNK> ."
"we have some <UNK> who are not terribly active , but the party has been part of their social life their whole adult life ."
"since most <UNK> are n't filled to the maximum count , there 's no real pressure on these folks ."
"sometimes , knowing that a person is running lets us help to <UNK> an otherwise barely <UNK> vote ."
"if the person is n't voted in , they ca n't vote at our annual <UNK> meeting on the first of july when we <UNK> officers for the year ."
everyone here feels like they are helping to make things work better .
"today at about <UNK> on <UNK> , i was listening to someone on day to day speak with a <UNK> political <UNK> ."
they were talking about john kerry 's notion to <UNK> accepting the nomination .
"in fact , if you are going to talk about "" fake conventions "" -- then why are the republicans having a convention at all ?"
"perhaps you should think beyond the media feeding frenzy on this issue , and use your common sense ."

"liberals , of course , barrel <UNK> into the future with equal faith in the progress of man [ <UNK> ] ."
<UNK> in many of his essays <UNK> youth with <UNK> and age with <UNK> .
""" the democrat is a young conservative ; the conservative an old democrat ."

"sickness gets organized as well as health , the vice as well as the virtue ."
"now that a vicious system of trade has existed so long , it has <UNK> itself in the human generation , and <UNK> are born ."
<UNK> takes as low a view of every part of human action and passion .
"the cause of education is <UNK> in this country with the <UNK> <UNK> , — on what ground ?"
"such hints , be sure , are too valuable to be lost ."
"if you do not value the <UNK> , or other religious institutions , give yourself no concern about maintaining them ."
"of course , religion in such hands loses its essence ."
"as it loses its truth , it loses credit with the <UNK> ."

learn about the controversy surrounding the corporate distribution of the film urllink here .
some of the international press is <UNK> how this documentary could be <UNK> in the race .
"however , there 's a lot more reporting going on overseas than <UNK> at this point ."
check out urllink all the stories on google news .
"even when i urllink like the results , i have to put in a <UNK> -- every story you see like this is editorial material ."
"if you want to think about the election , make sure that you read multiple sources ."
i like to browse through urllink google news to see what the world is saying about john kerry .
"i also read the urllink guardian , home of urllink greg <UNK> , every night before i go to bed ."
many of the important reports on us issues from the international press do n't make it to us corporate media -- or do n't make it intact .
my family were interested in international politics when i was growing up .
"at the time , the best domestic newspaper was the urllink christian science monitor ."
"the urllink international <UNK> <UNK> used to be another trusted source for me ,"
"but to me , as noted on last tuesday , <#> of the <UNK> things is the press corps that 's following kerry ."
"since then , i 've been <UNK> google for news of kerry 's whistle stops ."
"<UNK> , local media is reporting on his full platform , as presented to their community ."
national press is picking <#> hot issue and blasting that .
so dog the net for local reporting if you want to hear a few <UNK> of what the candidate is really doing .
"in media , "" <UNK> <UNK> , "" let the consumer beware ."
"urllink according to knight - <UNK> new service , the <UNK> ( tax authorities ) of the state of texas have denied the <UNK> <UNK> church tax <UNK> status ."

you can send a message via <UNK> <UNK> urllink here .
it 's a pity all the ap could manage to cover was an aside on energy policy .
you can do so if you can relax in front of a crowd .
they mean that you should win by <UNK> a left wing to the tent .

simple : stay out of the other guy ’s way .
the uk 's guardian posted urllink this article on kerry 's conversation with nader yesterday .
but mr kerry asked mr nader not to judge him by his <UNK> .
"the sidewalk is <UNK> with <UNK> from the media trucks , and there are a <UNK> of perhaps <#> motorcycle police <UNK> near where i park my car ."
"people in line for the secret service <UNK> <UNK> to each other , their eyes bright ."
black women looking <UNK> in dark business suits .
"camera men looking , perhaps , a little less <UNK> than usual ."

"to <#> side , <UNK> <UNK> , and the seats in front of us are reserved for the <UNK> officials ."
"the high <UNK> for the candidate , dr . dean , and <#> more are no more than ten feet from me ."
"behind that , a <UNK> is filling up with students ranging in age from perhaps early <#> 's to middle age ."
"when the room is full , there are perhaps <#> or <UNK> of us , including a dozen or more camera and sound crew ."
"we spot tom <UNK> , head of democracy for america , come in to brief the room security ."
"kerry and dean enter to a rising , <UNK> crowd ."
"i hum "" hail to the chief "" in joyce 's ear and she smiles ."
"this morning , kerry looks fresh , rested , relaxed , and comfortable --"
"not at all the stiff figure i remember from yesterday on stage , or from the media ."
"there is a <UNK> in his eye , and i find myself <UNK> enjoying what he has to say ."

these are the people john kerry is here to help .
"he <UNK> his plans for keeping jobs on this shore , and <UNK> the programs that reward companies for sending jobs overseas ."
he talks about how his health plan will help .
how he will fully fund <UNK> and continuing education .
"how he has seen , going from state to state , how all these things have put americans into an environment of <UNK> ."
"then he goes back to jobs , social programs , bringing back an idea of the american dream for youth entering the workplace , education funding ."
"he pulls in questions from the crowd , comments from dean and the <#> unemployed people ."
he 's joking around and playing the press .
"it 's animated , intimate , and i begin to understand how some people could love this man ."
"he 's smiling , reaching to people , including us with his stance and his <UNK> ."
this is the john kerry i was hoping to see .
you can feel the warmth and <UNK> from the man .
"before a large crowd , everything about the man is on the parade grounds ."
"but here in a circle of instant friends , he is at ease ."
"he is a man among his people , not an officer <UNK> his troops ."
"i wonder if my own <UNK> has been <UNK> to that officer 's bearing his projects on the media , old <UNK> that i am ."
"however , i am well satisfied that , in my little professional marketing heart , this is a product i can promote with integrity . later in the day"
", i check the internet for stories filed from the press on the morning meeting , but i am <UNK> ."
"from this intimate message of hope , there is only <#> sound <UNK> that gets picked up ."
it had nearly nothing to do with the well - integrated job and education platform he presented .
it was not a <UNK> for the warmth he showed -- in fact it might have been the <UNK> moment in the whole presentation .
this is why i urge you to read his stuff on the urllink website and see him in person if you can .
talk to the local democrats or the local campaign office and see if you can come to a smaller event .
this is a man you would n't mind seeing in the west wing .
i 've created a new <UNK> for <UNK> for kerry .
go to our page on urllink <UNK> and sign up .
doing a summer service on the importance of democracy ?
"i 'm going to leave this open and <UNK> for now , but please do not come on the list to flame or spam ."
"this morning , i sent email to my son 's teacher and said , "" joseph and i are <UNK> a field trip ."
probably half the people in the room were working on kerry issues already .
most of us are working on <UNK> ( get out the vote ) projects .
"( now you know , when you see <UNK> , it 's not a cable channel ! ;)"
"we got in the mid - range section , in front of the press <UNK> , behind the "" <UNK> "" section ."
it was lovely to see such a great crowd there .
"i did n't get his name , but he was a republican until january , and now he 's <UNK> up support for jk ."
"he is a little wooden , even in person ."
"he needs to do yoga , or <UNK> , i think ."
"a lot of tension , beyond the possible <UNK> of an old military guy ."
"however , i found his address reasonably inspiring for content , and sincerely delivered ."
"he covered the usual topics -- his policies on health care , non - <UNK> foreign policy , human rights by example ."
"it was not just about "" i 'm not bush "" but more about healing the damage done , and moving forward ."
i want to see that -- it could make such a huge difference .
right now so many kids are signing up for military service because it 's the only way they feel they can hope to get a degree .
joseph -- my <#> year old son -- says his highlight of the day was hugging howard dean .
but kerry 's proposal for free tuition for public service tops my list .
you can read urllink john 's take on it . or you might enjoy urllink his hometown paper taking him on .
ralph nader has about as much chance of being president as <UNK> <UNK> at this point .
"second , read urllink what the man has to say ."
"he writes better than he talks , which puts him a step above bush who can only speak when someone 's feeding him rhetoric ."
"but the man does n't seem to come off as well in the media as he does in "" print ."
""" third , he can inspire a <UNK> - old to burst into urllink song ."
"ok , that 's silly , but i had to include it ..."
how many of clinton 's cabinet did you hate ?
"now , think on these names : cheney ."
"think of the issues you 've seen go <UNK> bad in the last <#> years , like air quality ."
"consider if democrats are likely to support <UNK> the constitution in "" defense of marriage . """
"fifth , because the people you wanted to win the nomination probably are backing kerry now ."
"even urllink dennis <UNK> , who i voted for in the oregon primary , because i want to send a progressive message to the national party ."
"but dennis , howard dean and i ( and many others ) agree that the support must go to the <UNK> , and kerry will be that <UNK> ."
think we need to stay passive in this <UNK> age ?
i have a much higher chance of doing that if i 'm a key volunteer than if i sit at home and <UNK> .
let 's not <UNK> up -- let 's give them a <UNK> !
ninth -- you like urllink ketchup with a kick !
"depending on where you are in the country , the words will change ."
"if you are in <UNK> , you are organized by <UNK> on a political basis , rather than a county ."
"if you 're in boston you are part of a ward , and if you are in oregon , you have a <UNK> ."
"here , we have a central committee , which is the general monthly meeting of anyone who wants to show up ."
"if you 're in <UNK> nc , everyone 's invited to the monthly executive committee meeting , but only <UNK> committee members can vote ."
the structure and <UNK> of labor will <UNK> from place to place .
you 're first assignment is to figure out what 's going on in your state and county : urllink here .
"call , email , go to a meeting ."
you may be lucky and have a great first experience .
your second assignment ( if necessary ) is to <UNK> that for the common good .
"get past the patriotic <UNK> , or the <UNK> volunteer <UNK> , or the person who really thought that <UNK> should have been the <UNK> , or whoever ."
"go as a team with other like minded folks from your social action committee , <UNK> group , or whatever ."
remember that little flaming <UNK> and lay it like a seal upon your heart .
"just as there are a <UNK> different <UNK> cultures , each county party is a little different too ."
<UNK> are generally organized on a level of <UNK> or <UNK> .
this is to make each area into some <UNK> chunk .
"in a rural area , these can be huge because they are generally divided up into chunks by population ."
urllink <#> study found that nearly <#> percent more folks voted when personally <UNK> .
"no other political action ( phone bank , direct mail , media appeals ) can match this ."
does the idea of <UNK> make you cringe ?
"well , if you can ... get over it ."
respect the worth and dignity of the person who <UNK> you at the door !
most of them will be nice -- some really happy to see you ! -- and very few will slam the door in your face .
"we spend a lot of time talking about this stuff , and very little time really working on it ."
"but if you are really shy and just ca n't do it , find something else to do ."
"you may have skills at organizing events , legal issues , <UNK> administration , <UNK> , or any number of things that you may even have learned at church ."
do n't take no for an answer . and do n't say yes too often and burn yourself out .
"most of my adult life i 've voted democrat , but much of that time i 've been a registered independent ."
"heck , when i was in chapel hill , i was registered as a republican so i could vote against jesse <UNK> twice ."
"first , about a year ago , i got involved in the dean campaign here in portland , oregon ."
"then i got involved in the democratic party of <UNK> county ( basically , portland ) ."
"now , many of you may imagine that a county political party is a closed set -- and in a few places , maybe it is ."
"but most places i 've lived , the county democrats are nearly <UNK> from any enthusiastic <UNK> , at the <UNK> level ."
there are no fat white guys <UNK> <UNK> in smoke - filled back rooms here .
there are a bunch of <UNK> volunteers wishing that the nation did n't think that there was something inherently <UNK> about political work .
"of course , most of us think that because there is ."
"face it , if you want to save the <UNK> , it 's always going to be easier to make that issue black and white ."
but that 's only because you can imagine that issues are clean and neat .
"let me tell you , it 's time to get over it ."
do you want to see another <#> years of bush in office ?
"they go into politics or crime . "" -- software engineer <UNK> <UNK> , urllink """
"<UNK> in the la times on why us work <UNK> to <UNK> is making india a better place ( and by extension , <UNK> <UNK> here ? ;)"
"i can <UNK> to the "" politics "" part from * intimate * experience , <UNK> ... !"
this little urllink flash <UNK> <UNK> some of the <UNK> of bush and kerry on some of the major issues of the campaign .
"of course , the <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> on both sides ."
"i wish they had put more thought into the differences on iraq and foreign policy , for example ."
but it 's a good <UNK> to begin your <UNK> friends with ....
"i 'd feel better if i believed that we were , in fact , fighting for those principles overseas , but it 's still a great sentiment ."
"among those who do have an opinion , mr ."
more than <#> percent of <UNK> said that mr .
"kerry says what he thinks voters want to hear , suggesting that mr ."
bush has had success in <UNK> his opponent as a flip - <UNK> .
there 's lots more <UNK> of the <UNK> in the article .
<UNK> for the new york times online is free .
"in this age of scientific <UNK> , what this means is that they talked to <#> adults , among which only <#> were registered voters ."
the <UNK> event is <#> of many taking place outside the united states .
iraq and <UNK> are amongst more than <#> countries where <UNK> democratic party supporters are <UNK> to help mr kerry reach the white house .
"ms <UNK> works for an <UNK> dependent on us government funds , but she said that this did not present a problem ."
""" there is evidence there is a large percentage of americans who want a change in both foreign and domestic policy ."
"so i feel quite comfortable working within a democracy to foster change . """
she said she was not surprised that many americans in <UNK> did not support george bush .
he says it 's no business of mine where he goes after choir practice and it 's a free country .
"i mean , he might be going to <UNK> meetings or islamic study groups ."
"the thing is , if people do n't say where they 're going after choir practice , this country is at risk ."
so i have been applying a certain amount of pressure on my son to tell me where he 's going .
to begin with i simply put a bag over his head and <UNK> him to a <UNK> . but
my wife had the <UNK> to suggest that i might be going a bit too far .
so i put a bag over her head and <UNK> her to the <UNK> .
but i still could n't <UNK> my son to tell me where he goes after choir practice .
"i <UNK> to <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> methods because , after all , he is my son ."
i read in the new york times last week that a <UNK> had been prepared for the defence secretary on march <#> <#> .
"the march <#> <UNK> , prepared for mr rumsfeld explained that what may look like torture is not really torture at all ."
if his objective is something else - such as finding out where his son goes after choir practice - then it is not torture .
"... and so does jones , with biting wit ."
"urllink "" so what ? "" you say ."
it 's nothing you would n't expect from most people when things get heated .
"in fact , the vice president is <UNK> prevented from voting except in the case of ties ."
this makes cheney 's action the rough equivalent of a ceo <UNK> out a member of the executive committee in front of his peers .
the groups make no bones about their goal - to draw votes away from democrat john kerry and help president bush win this <UNK> state in november .
the oregon family council also has been working the phones to boost attendance at nader 's event - with the idea that it could help bush this fall .
""" we are n't <UNK> about doing it , "" said mike white , the group 's director ."
""" we are a conservative , pro - family organization , and bush is our guy on virtually every issue . """
"but he said he 's not bothered by their actions , either ."
i never heard that quote in his interview .
nader <UNK> in the interview that he is a <UNK> man .
"he is trying to please everyone , to show that he is passionate to his base , and to show that he is politically sophisticated to the press ."
"he 's not "" flip - <UNK> "" -- he has developed a strategy that insists that you accept his <UNK> as <UNK> ."
i think he is very much self - <UNK> on this .
he says he needs to run for office to have the same voice in public affairs he had as an <UNK> in years past .
could this be because he does n't understand modern media ?
"the man still writes on a manual <UNK> , and <UNK> computers entirely ."
nader in <#> -- <UNK> at any speed .
the house has passed a similar bill that would set <UNK> at $ <#> .
differences between the <#> bills must be worked out .
"mind you , this is * <UNK> * ( swearing -- the "" <#> bad words "" ) , not <UNK> ."
""" ah yes , senator , i 'd like you to vote for my "" <UNK> of the purple rage "" <UNK> ."
"we want to get them air america types to stop saying that bush <UNK> up . """
""" how patriotic , senator ! "" and here among folks who listen to npr and air america , i 'm thinking ..."
"i mean , this is a fine that goes to the radio host regardless if it 's a person who calls in or what ..."
so suddenly the hosts are going to be putting their radio engineers on triple <UNK> on those morning shows to keep their finger over that button to <UNK> <UNK> .
"i mean , hey , it 's per incident right ?"
"so that means if <#> people get through a day , it could be $ <UNK> out of rush 's pocket ."
"where do these <UNK> go to , anyway ?"

"so i thought , as a result of my <UNK> experience . . ."

this year we focus on places <UNK> call home - be it homes they once left or new homes .

the responsibility attached to lincoln 's words does not end at our <UNK> .
"across the world , <UNK> need our assistance and our support ."
they look to america 's voice and leadership to champion their <UNK> . and perhaps nowhere is the need for leadership greater than in sudan today .

"my father , a <UNK> minister , was deeply involved in the civil rights movement led by martin luther king ."
"i remember seeing him off , to go march in <UNK> , like seeing him off to go to war ."
"i remember asking my father why , why , why it was that people just didn’t"
"see what was right , that the old ways were wrong , and that they should learn to live together and be good ."
"and my father <UNK> down to my height , and told me , “"
"then he stood up , and sighed , and said , “"
"meanwhile , i have travelling to do . ”"
"i felt a truth in what my father said there , although really i don’t think he thought of it as a moment of <UNK> or even importance ."
"i have struggled with that for <#> years now , and i’ve <UNK> my <UNK> ."
"to me , there always seemed something clear and <UNK> about devotion to a cause ."
"civil rights , peace , <UNK> , civil liberties , digital divide <UNK> , the rights of sexual <UNK> –"
these are all causes i’ve been involved in over the years .
"it is always easy to be <UNK> for a cause – in your mind , you can always shape what you are fighting for ."
"politicians , on the other hand , will always say something that will make you want to curl up in a corner and die of embarrassment ."
"so most of my <#> years of <UNK> i have reserved my energy for issues , not for parties or candidates ."
"i’ve learned a few things – the more you know , the less clean an issue is ."

"something to <UNK> democracy further , some act of many ."
i think it ’s time we brought the f word back into politics .
” now i was a little shocked .
but she went on : “ i am old enough to remember the rise of <UNK> in europe .
"everyone thinks of hitler , but it started first with <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"and you know , <UNK> <UNK> was a fat good old boy in the hip pocket of business , and a <UNK> of <UNK> ."
and no <#> reminds me of the man ’s character so much as this young bush .
i am not saying that the people in dc are <UNK> .
i am only saying that the comparison makes me far too uncomfortable .
"in <#> , it moved me to action ."
"now , i’m fond of third parties , but there is no third party that ’s going to turn bush out this fall ."
i started out thinking that the democrats had got to field a candidate that i could support .
"but i grew up in <UNK> , and in late <#> , i heard that howard dean was running ."
the first candidate for the presidency with such integrity since jimmy carter .
but already the media was painting him with the broad brush of “ <UNK> republican ”
"it ’s a message that isn’t so harsh in the face of <UNK> , war , pollution , and the loss of rights and liberties . as a result"
", i figured i could support him , even though i thought the man would get eaten alive ."
"much to my surprise , a couple things happened ."
dean managed to change something fundamental in american political <UNK> .
we’ve scared the crap out of some folks high up in the democratic party .
and that ’s why i’m here today talking to you .
we <UNK> were given basic ideas and materials and told – go do what you know how to do .
"we were not given <UNK> , and sometimes not even given much guidance ."
"the day i agree with a candidate for public office <#> % , it means i’m running for office myself , and just shoot me ."
"as a mom , i won’t tell my son <UNK> , “"
someday you could grow up to be president . ”
what a curse ! to find someone of decent character who ’s willing to go through the crap
"we get anyone decent at all , ever ."
"kerry is , i’m convinced , a decent man ."
"he has good ideas , even if he doesn’t project well –"
"i’ve seen him in small groups now , a couple times , and he ’s really a fine man in person ."
i think he ’s afraid of <UNK> and the media does him no <UNK> .
"but if a candidate screws up , it ’s about the candidate ."
is it a <UNK> media feeding frenzy that <UNK> us up ?
"properly , in a democracy , the candidate is the <UNK> of the people , the <UNK> , and we shape his or her message ."
and our lack of belief is self - fulfilling .
"we know , in social action circles that life in the public <UNK> is about compromise ."
"we understand , every time we appeal to our allies in government , that they are <UNK> by compromise built into the system at every level ."
"yet when a candidate <UNK> a message so that he or she can get elected and act on our behalf , we <UNK> it ."
"<#> reason is that , the day after the election , we feel <UNK> ."
because no <#> has ever taught us <UNK> how to work directly on the political system the way we know how to work on <UNK> .
"well , i’ve been learning fast , and you can too !"
our <UNK> principles say that we support “ the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our <UNK> and in society at large .
but <UNK> and the <UNK> will not say this .
our <UNK> and our <UNK> are restricted under section <UNK> ] of the <UNK> code to neither speak for nor against any candidate for public office .
it ’s part of the separation of church and state that is ignored by the christian right with apparent <UNK> .
so you will not hear our professional leadership call for you to work against bush .
"not from <UNK> street , and not from professional <UNK> ."
so what did i learn from the dean campaign ?
"i learned that i thought it was an issue of personal conscience to avoid politics , but it was just a lazy habit ."
"worse it ’s a habit <UNK> <UNK> in many of us by years of <UNK> media , and not the result of personal experience ."
"if it was good enough for <UNK> <UNK> , i just have to believe it ’s"
i learned that the local democrats are a bunch of generally <UNK> socially minded activists not much different from any <UNK> <UNK> i’ve been involved with .
so i can work all my favorite progressive issues at once by making sure the <UNK> toe the liberal line .
"hard work , but someone has got to do it ."
"the more people of good conscience who get involved , the <UNK> the process ."
"now , some of you probably voted for nader last election –"
"some of you probably believed at that time , nader ’s message that there is no difference between the <#> major parties ."
<UNK> in the democrats is a <UNK> of a lack of popular <UNK> support .
just $ <#> at a time over the net .
this is the year for us to organize those resources to turn the bush administration out of office .
it must come from us . working with <UNK> and
"such is fine , but direct action will come through the local democratic party and the kerry campaign ."
"i want you to get offline , and get out your walking shoes ."
"but it can’t be just “ anybody but bush . ” listen ,"
every <#> of you knows how we keep local politicians held <UNK> .
"yes , it ’s through holding them <UNK> for individual votes and actions ."
it ’s also through showing them that we are their base .
"people of conscience , people of principle , people of good will and good works , need to become the political base of the democratic party again ."
so that we are the guidance that <UNK> up .
"so our contributions become more powerful than those of any corporate <UNK> , as they did during the dean campaign ."
"we are millions , and we know how to walk the walk even if we do talk the talk a bit too much ."
and we know how to put our money where our mouth is .
the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our <UNK> and in society at large
"so , this year , help me organize the religious left ."
"i’m <#> unemployed single mom , short on time and energy ."
"i can only shine <#> liberal light on the process – together we can light a fire under this democracy , and burn it clean ."
"we are not alone , we are not alone we are not alone today ."
"oh , deep in my heart , i do believe , we shall overcome someday ."
"we 're on to victory , we 're on to victory"
"; oh , deep in my heart , i do believe , we 're on to victory someday ."

"let us honor the dead in proportion , and <UNK> the living -- to the end that we improve our country ."
from the vast internet : how many members of the bush administration are needed to replace a <UNK> ?
the answer is <#> : <#> . <#> to deny that a <UNK> needs to be replaced <#> .
"<#> to attack and question the patriotism of anyone who has questions about the <UNK> , <#> ."
"<#> to blame the previous administration for the need of a new <UNK> , <#> ."
"<#> to arrange the invasion of a country <UNK> to have a secret <UNK> of <UNK> , <#> ."
"<#> to get together with vice president cheney and figure out how to pay <UNK> <UNK> <#> <#> dollars for a <UNK> , <#> ."
<#> to explain to bush the difference between screwing a <UNK> and screwing the country .
"<UNK> , i simply love <UNK> <UNK> 's writer 's <UNK> which <UNK> on <UNK> - fm at <#> am on <UNK> ."
it was on this day in <#> that british forces began the <UNK> from <UNK> ...
it was on this day in <#> that the battle of <UNK> took place over the pacific ocean ...
"it was <#> this day in <#> that the 19th amendment to the constitution , giving women the right to vote , was passed by the united states congress ..."
check the link for a full <UNK> of these significant events ( and a poem by <UNK> ) .
"i found it in the guardian , of course , with an article on how extensive plans have become for urllink <UNK> the draft shortly after the election ."
", <#> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and <#> does not ."
both close the <UNK> borders to draft <UNK> .
there is <UNK> legislation in the american house of representatives and senate in the form of twin bills - <UNK> and <UNK> .
there already exists a <UNK> service system ( <UNK> ) .
"all young americans are <UNK> to "" register for the draft "" ."
"it has been a mere <UNK> since <UNK> was <UNK> <#> decades ago , after vietnam , together with the <UNK> ( and much burned ) draft card ."
a $ <UNK> implementation fund has been added to the <UNK> budget .
the pentagon is <UNK> <UNK> for <#> draft board officers and <#> appeals board members <UNK> .
draft - <UNK> will be harder than in the <UNK> .
there will be no <UNK> on higher - education grounds .
all this has been pushed ahead with an amazing lack of publicity .
"american newspapers are in a state of <UNK> , distracted by war - reporting <UNK> at usa today and the new york times ."
the fourth estate has failed the american public and continues not to do its job .
the american public just wants the war to go away .
<#> thing that would get their attention ( but not their votes ) would be their children being sent off to die in foreign lands .
"best not disturb the <UNK> until after november , seems to be the thinking ."
"there are , after all , more important things than wars : getting your man into the white house , for example ."
"kerry has clearly <UNK> that , as president , he too may have to bring in the draft ."
i will be looking for a reaction from the kerry campaign in the next short while .
"i would still vote for kerry over bush , but i would encourage him to <UNK> <UNK> to the volunteer forces rather than a draft ."
in the previous post i <UNK> some of kerry 's remarks .
"you must understand war to plan for peace , just as you must understand disease to cure it ! ) ."
urllink just ca n't report on the issues to save their life .
this speech gets turned into a comparison of media campaigns .
but <UNK> is urllink taking heat from some republicans who say that terry heinz might have influenced the <UNK> through her <UNK> to <UNK> .
perhaps the kerry folks are seeing the same thing i am -- that his words are n't making it into the press .
so he 's now apparently releasing his urllink prepared speeches via the <UNK> service .
"second , we must <UNK> the world 's most powerful military to meet new threats ."
"fourth , to secure our full independence and freedom , we must free america from its dangerous <UNK> on middle east oil ."
[ <UNK> ] i think of other great challenges this nation has set for itself .
"in <#> , president kennedy challenged us to go to the moon ."
our imagination and sense of discovery took us there .
"in <#> , just months after the <UNK> <UNK> crisis nearly brought the world to nuclear disaster president kennedy called for a nuclear test ban <UNK> ."
"and in time , a <UNK> between <UNK> and washington was established ."
the air cleared and hope emerged on the horizon .
"in our mission to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism , we should never feel helpless ."
"we should feel <UNK> that the <UNK> in our past will guide us toward a safer , more secure world ."
"vulnerable nuclear material anywhere is a threat to everyone , everywhere ."
we need to <UNK> a <UNK> strategy to keep the worst weapons from falling into the worst hands .
a strategy that <UNK> our non - military strength early enough and effectively enough so military force does n't become our only option .
america must lead and build an international <UNK> for early <UNK> action .
the first step is to <UNK> all bomb making material worldwide .
"that means making sure we know where they are , and then <UNK> them up and <UNK> them wherever they are ."
our approach should treat all nuclear materials needed for bombs as if they were bombs .
[ <UNK> ] the second step is to prevent the creation of new materials that are being produced for nuclear weapons .
", this administration is <UNK> , and endlessly reviewing the need for such a policy ."
the third step is to reduce excess <UNK> of materials and weapons .
"as president , i will stop this administration 's program to develop a whole new generation of <UNK> - <UNK> nuclear bombs ."
and it <UNK> our credibility in <UNK> other nations .
"what kind of message does it send when we 're asking other countries not to develop nuclear weapons , but developing new ones ourselves ?"
we do n't need a world with more <UNK> nuclear weapons .
we need a world where terrorists ca n't ever use <#> .
that should be our focus in the post <#> world .
our fourth step is to end the nuclear weapons programs in states like north korea and iran .
this administration has been <UNK> on iraq while the nuclear <UNK> from north korea have <UNK> .
we know that north korea has sold <UNK> <UNK> and technology in the past . and
"according to recent reports , north korean <UNK> ended up in <UNK> hands ."
the north <UNK> have made it clear to the world - and to the terrorists - that they are open for business and will sell to the highest <UNK> .
we must also take steps to reduce tension between india and pakistan and guard against the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands there .
"so let it be clear : finally and <UNK> , preventing nuclear terrorism"
is our most urgent priority to provide for america 's long term security .
we have to do everything we can to stop a nuclear weapon from ever reaching our shore - and that mission begins far away .
this is not an easy topic : it can be frightening .
"at this hour , <UNK> go <UNK> , bomb making materials sit in forgotten facilities , and terrorists plot away ."
they sit in <UNK> rooms all across the globe .
we are living through days of great and <UNK> risks .
"today , we must not <UNK> our eyes , or pretend it 's not there - or think that we can simply wait it out ."
that is not our history - or our hope .
"last saturday , i attended the dedication of the world war ii memorial ."
he 's part of the greatest generation and jumped into enemy territory during the invasion of <UNK> .
"like so many other young men that day , he looked fear in the face and <UNK> it ."
june 6th - this coming saturday - marks the anniversary of that day which saved the free world .
"<#> years ago , more than <#> young men were ready to storm <UNK> beach ."
"their landing <UNK> were heading for an open beach , where they <UNK> a wall of concrete and bullets ."
they knew there was an overwhelming chance that they might die before their boots hit the sand .
but they jumped into the shallow waters and fought their way <UNK> .
"because at the end of the beach , beyond the cliff was the hope of a safer world ."
we face a challenge - no matter how <UNK> - because we know that on the other side of <UNK> <UNK> hope .
"as president , i will not wait or <UNK> in the face of the new threats of this new era ."
"i know it will not be easy , but the greatest <UNK> for peace and freedom never are ."
there are no cake - walks in the contest with terrorists and <UNK> states .
"we must lead this effort not just for our own safety , but for the good of the world ."
"just as he led america to face the threat of communism , so too , we must now face the twin threats of nuclear <UNK> and terrorism ."
this is a great challenge for our generation - and the <UNK> are as high as they were on d - day and in president <UNK> 's time .
"for the sake of all the generations to come , we will meet this test and we will succeed ."
"from a friend who <UNK> to remain anonymous : "" dang !"

"okay , i guess it would help in cutting down on updates if i would read what i wrote <#> years ago ."
"mainly , i am working , and with computers ."
in december of <#> i lost a really crappy job at a call center here in victoria .
"i wo n't but the name did contain the words , "" <UNK> , "" and "" <UNK> ."
"anyway , i am not a very good <UNK> when comes to trying to con <UNK> and old people out of more money ."
in march of <#> i got a job at a <UNK> school here in victoria .
i was doing the computer technology for them .
"dear god , but if anyone can <UNK> out a <UNK> os than that miserable excuse of an operating system , it could only be the u.s ."
"that , and they had no permanent facility at that time ."
"so i wound up building a network a day , and then tearing it down each evening ."
in october i was offered a position at <UNK> high school and jumped at it .
"it was teaching much older students , very well motivated students , and <#> of the number of students"
i had been working with at the <UNK> school .
so i drive <#> miles <#> way and work with <#> students each day instead of <#> .
"life is good , i get paid , and have access to a <UNK> ."
"well , maybe summers off , but wait , i am now a teacher , so i get that too !"
<UNK> <UNK> is no longer a <UNK> <UNK> .
"he went over <#> pounds ( well over <#> pounds ) , and is now a standard ."
he is still the sweetest in nature and very protective of his pack ( da <UNK> ) .
"well , it 's been a while since i set this blog up ."
so long that i forgot about it existing .
my hope is to get more involved with this over the summer .
"since i am a school teacher , you would think i would have the time . since i am also a student"
he went to a no kill shelter and was adopted by a very nice family .
he is a kitten who showed up at my mother 's house about <#> months before she died .
"my wife and i brought him home to texas after the funeral and he has made himself at home , which is what we wanted ."
his pic is on the webpage at : <UNK> - <UNK> there are <#> kinds of people in the world .
"those who read <UNK> , and those who do n't"
"ah . it is saturday , the first day of the summer break , and there is <#> good thing about <#> teachers being in the same house ."
you pretty much have the same days off .
here is a urllink link to a pic of some other <UNK> of our home .
"far left is curry ( named after the spice mixture ) , the white dog is jamie , and the dark <#> is <UNK> ."
"then you see most of the back of <UNK> , who is from <UNK> and is staying with us while being a foreign exchange student ."
he leaves at the end of june and we will all miss him a great deal .
"especially the animals , who have become very attached to him ."
i do not think they will understand his leaving .
"well , school is out , and it was an interesting experience on the last <#> days ."
i did not realize how much the last days would affect me emotionally .
it snuck up on my cisco class as well .
there was some real shock that the end had arrived .
a lot are juniors and i will see them in the fall and i look forward to that .
i also look forward to teaching a new subject .
i will be glad when it is over .
"it has been a good year , even though a tiring <#> ."
"i take the <UNK> on october <#> , and the <UNK> in november ."
math class is currently quite difficult for me .
but it is a <UNK> for the accounting class in the spring .
"i wonder though , do <UNK> really stand around the water cooler at work and wonder , "" what 's the opportunity cost on that ? """
i think the exercise will do me good .
"the prices are reasonable , and the quality is good ."
"and if you see other products you would like to buy from my store , let me know and i 'll add it ."
"at work , i use <#> different computer applications to record the time i spend on different projects each week ."
"so why , in this information ( electronic ) age , do i still have to fill out a paper ' time sheet ' in order to get paid ?"
said time card to then sit on my boss 's desk and not get turned in ...
some of you may know i am going back to school next fall ( <#> ) for a double masters ( <UNK> environmental studies ) .
i am starting on the essay questions for the mba program today :
"how do your background and goals , <UNK> and weaknesses , match up with the characteristics and <UNK> of the oregon mba program or the master of accounting program ?"
<#> . consider the changes <UNK> by the revolution in information technology ; are <UNK> <UNK> identical with progress ?
"<#> . a number of universities have attracted <UNK> <UNK> for seeking to monitor and <UNK> the working conditions in <UNK> owned by , or <UNK> university <UNK> ."
"as a future business leader , how do you view such actions ?"
"not sure what i 'll say , but it has to be brilliant in each <#> words or less ."
i 've been thinking i should document this process of ' going back to school . '
"i am thinking it will be a combination of this blog , video , pictures , and such ."
"so with this , i suppose , it begins ."
now that i have it up and running ( correctly ) i find i have nothing to say .
my mom likes to send me <UNK> filled with <UNK> from papers and magazines .
usually with no note to explain why the <UNK> are relevant .
urllink <UNK> apparently <UNK> has a distance learning option for the <UNK> program . and their <UNK> program was rated # <#> in <#> by us news .
( they have n't done a review since of <UNK> programs ) .
"it does require some on - campus time , but since campus is only <#> minutes away from here , that is n't a big deal ."
i would n't have to quit my job ( and work may ( emphasis on may ) pay for some of it ) .
claire could still go to school . and in <#> years claire
and i would both have advanced a level in the school degree <UNK> .
the <UNK> program maps somewhat with what i do now .
"my friend dawn who works here has an <UNK> degree from indiana university , and it is part of the <UNK> she got the job ."
and strangely it will be the same degree that my mom has .
"i am not so much interested in working in a library , per se , but the information science part is interesting ."
i just need to gather a few things .
i got the university of oregon to send my letters of <UNK> to the <UNK> program .
on the house side of things ... not so good .
the only interest rate we 've been able to get so far is <#> % .
outrageous ! mostly because we have a bad credit history .
"the last <#> years have been very good , but banks are looking for more like <#> - <#> years ."
there are so many <UNK> to jump through .
"in a way , i do n't understand ."
we have always made our rent payments on time .
"they want you to be living in a single place for <#> years , too ."
"why would they care , since i am renting ?"
we keep moving because we find better places to live .
that should bring things up to date at this point .
i guess i can still use this blog to track my upcoming education after all .
for a couple of years now claire has been talking about going back to school .
"recently , her interest <UNK> in physics . and"
"really , it does make more sense for her to go back to school , rather than me ."
the bad part is that we wo n't be leaving illinois anytime soon .
it 's just a lot cheaper to go to school here .
and i have a job that i wo n't lose anytime soon . unless that was just <UNK> irony .
"so , now we start down the path of getting <UNK> in day care for next fall ."
she 'll be at a good age : <#> .
claire will work on getting all the crappy <UNK> stuff together for school .
i will continue to plug away at my job .
maybe start to look for something else within the company .
the debt - to - income ratio is very good for us .
"but the <UNK> , and our general credit does n't help ."
we found a good house that suits us well .
"just enough fix - up stuff to make it worthwhile ,"
but it 's also pretty big . and needs a paint job on the outside next year .
"so , while we seemed to have made this decision quickly , it 's actually been coming for a while ."
"claire has been "" following "" me around doing my stuff for a while ."
now it 's time for her to do something for herself .
"plus if she can get a <UNK> - good job , i can stay home and be a house - husband ."
and that 's all i have to say about that .
i am going to take the <UNK> again .
i did the online full - length practice test ( just focusing on the math ) and got a <#> .
"if i had gotten a <#> on the real test , i 'd have an <UNK> <#> ."
so claire bought me an algebra <UNK> book .
"should help with my regular math class , too ."
it <UNK> tricks and tools for those who get the <UNK> just thinking about math !
i also got my <#> letters of <UNK> .
"thank you kim , john , and dawn ."
i have <#> of the <#> essays written for the mba application .
( i 'll be posting my responses to the essay questions when i finish them . )
and i am going to send off my grad school application this week .
still have to finish the mba and ms applications .
the whole applying process needs a <UNK> of the user experience .
too many different places to go to get the right information on what to send .
and often the information ( even within a department ) <UNK> itself .
a friend thinks i should just go for the ms in environmental studies .
"it 's not that she thinks i ca n't do both , or would n't like both ."
it 's that she does n't want to see me invest all the effort and half - way through realize i do n't like it .
"i feel like she has more to say , but then again she is usually straight - forward with her thoughts ."
"i am not so much questioning the idea of doing both , but i am thinking about what she said ."
i tried to add a comments feature to allow readers ( or probably reader ) to post comments on what i write .
turns out that <UNK> ( from whom i receive me service ) only allows their <UNK> <UNK> scripts on ' home ' accounts .
i 'll have to get a ' business ' account if i want to use custom <UNK> .
though i want to add it in the future .
i believe that what you have to say about what i write can be an interesting addition to the <UNK> .
i 'll look into what it would take to switch to a business account .
not so good . my <UNK> score was <#> .
"<#> in math ( <#> out of <#> questions correct ) , and <#> in verbal ( <#> out of <#> questions correct ) ."
"the <#> essays have not been scored yet , so i assume my score will go up some ."
i expect that the combined score from the <#> essays should put me over <#> .
"the highest i can get on the essays combined is ( if i understand their scoring correctly ) <#> , which would give me <#> ."
"<#> is the minimum requirement for the university of oregon ( <UNK> ) , so i would still be off the mark ."
i think my score will go up some based on less test anxiety .
but i have never been good at math .
"i really do try , but my brain just does n't get it ."
the <UNK> recently cut the amount of admitted students from around <#> to <#> in order to increase their <UNK> for average admitted <UNK> score .
i do n't think my score will be helpful to them .
"is the <UNK> the end - all , or will having the other parts of my <UNK> help ?"
"my total gpa in <UNK> was only <#> ( but it was near <#> in my last <#> years , with <#> semester 's honors ) ."
the <#> is thanks to a <#> ( which strangely is still a d ) from southern oregon state college during my <UNK> there from <#> - <#> .
i feel bad for not doing well on the test .
"i do n't feel my score <UNK> me , or my ability to succeed ."
"however , it does define me in the eyes of the <UNK> committee ."
the inspection and <UNK> test were on the 11th of november .
"for the <UNK> test he left the <UNK> in for <#> hours , taking a reading each hour ."
"<#> <UNK> is the upper limit , and is like smoking <#> cigarettes per day ."
i think it must be an <UNK> <UNK> because even though <#> is half of <#> it is n't the same as smoking <#> cigarettes a day .
"the roof will need to be replace within <#> years , <#> years if we vent the <UNK> which needs to happen regardless ."
"hand <UNK> need to be installed on all stairs , which the <UNK> is installing ."
"the <UNK> is past it 's prime , but still works very well ."
the <UNK> turns on the heat high and in <#> minutes it was <UNK> hot . and it was about <#> degrees ( f ) outside .
"the <UNK> need cleaning , and <UNK> guards attached ."
"it covers similar things , but not as in <UNK> ."
<#> thing they look for is lead - based paint .
the <UNK> said there is no need for a required <UNK> as the facing paint is not lead - based .
"however there could be lead - based paint under the facing paint , so since the paint is <UNK> we will need to <UNK> this coming <UNK> ."
and we will have to bear the cost .
"in our original deal , the <UNK> was to pay <#> $ to <UNK> , but only if required ."
the upside is that we also met the bank guy .
"he mentioned a new <UNK> option that gives us money back at closing , and gets the <UNK> to replace the <UNK> and install <UNK> ."
this thing called urllink <UNK> is a charity that the <UNK> gives <#> % of the purchase price to .
they in turn keep the <#> % and give us the <#> % .
"i think it should be tax - <UNK> for the <UNK> , too ."
and we locked in at <#> % fixed rate .
the rate will actually be <#> % because of the private mortgage insurance ( <UNK> ) .
"december 6th is the closing date , and a house - warming on january 18th ."
"if we know you , you are invited ."
email urllink me if you want to come .
"when i get all the reports , i will scan them , <UNK> them , and post them here ."
the <UNK> 's ( not <UNK> ) report is about <#> pages long .
"when i asked him , while signing his <#> $ check !"
", if the place was ' <UNK> ' he said , "" oh definitely . """
so even though there will be some work on the place i think we are getting a good deal .
he said a lot of the things that are wrong would n't be wrong if the current <UNK> were into fixing things up .
i get the impression they just do n't have the time .
and we get to celebrate in a new house .
"well , if we go with this urllink <UNK> loan , a <UNK> <UNK> is not an option ."
she <UNK> with <#> which was the initial asking price when we first looked at the house .
"in our purchase agreement , the <UNK> will be responsible for up to <#> $ in costs for painting ."
and we get the portable storage unit that is on the driveway under the <UNK> .
so the <UNK> for house and <UNK> are on the 11th .
"the <UNK> <UNK> ( separate from the home <UNK> , and not at our cost ) will look for lead and the <UNK> will have a <UNK> inspection ."
if all goes well we should be closing on or before <UNK> 15th .
"painting probably wo n't happen until the spring , depending on the weather ."
right now the purchase agreement is with the lawyer ( another <#> $ from us ) to be drawn into a real contract .
we wo n't have to pay our first mortgage payment until february 1st .
so that will help with the month of january .
i 'll give notice on our apartment for move our by the end of december .
"so we should have at least <#> weeks to move . which is good because it means we can do it ourselves , easily ."
i 'll be off the last week of december .
the <UNK> is asking <#> and is adding a <#> $ <UNK> <UNK> .
<#> of which is that there will be no lead paint .
any lead paint must be removed by the <UNK> or the loan wo n't happen .
trouble is that this home probably has lead <UNK> paint ( an inspection is <UNK> ) .
<UNK> so that 's out of her pocket .
she counter - offered with <#> ( the original asking price when she put it on the market ) and agreed then to the <#> $ <UNK> .
"this is because we have specific colors already picked out for the place , and would save money by painting it ourselves ."
so i will call the agent this morning and offer that .
"we want the bathroom and kitchen to be more on the modern side , and leave the rest of the house ( with the exception of <UNK> ) <UNK> ."
"you might say , "" with <#> $ ?"
"to wit , i would respond : ikea ."
i do n't remember if i put a link to urllink pictures of the house .
"the last post was on thursday , october <#> ."
i mentioned something about house things being not - so - good .
offers of <#> % interest rates and all .
"well , on friday the real estate agent called ."
the guy works at a bank here in town and is working on the loan for the person who owns the home we want .
the agent mentioned that this guy has been able to work miracles in the past .
"we got approved to get a loan for the house we want , and the interest rate is only <#> % ."
( and closing costs with the down payment are only <#> % of the purchase price .
"<#> % until april <#> , at which point it will change to the market rate ( but can not change more than <#> % ) ."
"we can also get a fixed , <#> year <#> % mortgage ."
"while there are advantages to a fixed rate , we will be going with the <#> % ."
"it means about <#> $ less per month , and we will need that because right now we pay for just electric ."
i 've heard we will have to pay for all <UNK> when we own a home .
"then , once we get another year or <#> of good credit , we can <UNK> to a better fixed rate ."
assuming that rates do not sky - rocket over the next <#> years .
we are only <#> to <#> years from being ' on track ' according to the first bank we talked with .
i know that <UNK> places look at different things when looking to <UNK> ( argh !
so we meet with the agent today to set up the purchase agreement .
"after that we will set up the <UNK> : house , <UNK> , and lead ."
if that all looks good we might be able to close by the end of november .
<UNK> switched all of their domain services over last weekend .
changed my domain name from ' <UNK> ' to ' <UNK> ' and did n't tell me or even move my files .
drop me a urllink line if you get a bad link .
<UNK> ' in . still have stuff at the old place .
it was so dirty when we started moving in !
the first day was nothing but cleaning and moving over the furniture and <UNK> .
but the good thing is that dirt can be cleaned .
i asked the previous owners if they had a problem getting their <UNK> into the basement .
i looked at the size of theirs and they were the same as ours .
"cleaned the walls , put on the <UNK> ."
but we will leave it for a few days and focus on finishing the move .
neither of us like living in <#> places .
this weekend i hope to finish painting the room and install a new water <UNK> .
i found a service sticker on the <UNK> that was dated october <#> .
"though i would like to install something more modern , and smaller ."
and it was only <UNK> <UNK> has been pretty moody lately .
plus we really do n't follow a routine in our house .
my daughter ( who i have thought of as a <UNK> - old for about <#> months ) is going to be <#> .
i started the post below on the 13th of november and got side - <UNK> by work and vacation .
so my comment about <UNK> 's birthday is for <#> days from today .
"good thing too , since i have to design and <UNK> something this week !"
and i have n't really looked at the requirements yet .
"i think it is only a <UNK> of screens , but still ."
hope they are n't expecting something wonderful . probably just have to do paper <UNK> too .
claire and <UNK> went swimming while i worked .
"oh , i put new pics up on her site ."
other than that i am really looking forward to ripping this 70s - style fake wood <UNK> from the walls of the office .
i am realizing more and more that i hate doing <UNK> .
"actually the initial creation of <UNK> is not a problem , it 's just keeping up with the changes that seem to happen all the way through testing ."
the new battery will cost <UNK> this is what i get for getting a <UNK> <UNK> .
i heard that they did a lot of <UNK> so that you needed to service your car with <UNK> parts and <UNK> .
"could be a lie , but honestly with only <#> car i ca n't take the chance ."
"sorry to those who bought plane tickets , but wanted to surprise us by showing up ."
:p we did get our deposit back .
a little more than we needed to buy <UNK> 's bed .
"which , according to the <UNK> , should last until she is <#> ."
let 's just hope the company does n't go out of business .
i just realized after looking back over a number of posts that i have a lot of <UNK> .
we have auntie dawn babysitting so <UNK> and i can go on a date to a movie .
"lotr , since we have n't seen it ."
"oh , and urllink ron <UNK> has similar views on <UNK> ."
"seems like a nice guy , too . and"
"finally , i have n't been so busy at work as i am now in ages ."
good thing i still get paid for ot .
the amount of ot i get on the next pay check should take care of our mortgage payment .
"when her bed is delivered tomorrow , her room will be complete !"
it is nice to have it over and done with ( except for claire 's <UNK> ) .
"nice also to only live , physically and mentally , in <#> place ."
we spent most of the day <UNK> around .
claire and i took turns painting <UNK> 's room .
though that may be because she has some unknown virus ( maybe ) that has <UNK> itself through a skin rash .
"the doctor says , "" it 's probably something mild ."
now all we have to do is find places for everything .
"we do have more room now , but it is all <UNK> becuase there 's nothing in <UNK> 's room or the <UNK> ."
so it 's just a bunch of crap everywhere .
i just have to finish my application to grad school .
now that we are moved i can concentrate on that .
let 's tap the permanent fund instead of living within our means !
"why is it that when people do n't pay their bills , collection agencies get on your ass ?"
"but when the government does n't pay it 's bills , it gets to keep running anyway ."
just keep spending even though i do n't have any money .
"i chose the <UNK> <UNK> shirt , which i will wear when i play volleyball ."
"in fact , i <UNK> been a <UNK> but they wanted someone taller ."
"ya know , it would be nice if <UNK> would add a few more servers on the day cubs tickets go on sale ."
not sure what to do in an upcoming color - <UNK> crisis ?

truck asked me to record my experiences at my new job .
i feel i have to explain a little first .
i have <#> girls whom i love and i want to do everything in the world for them .
right now i stay home with them during the week while my wife ( whom i will refer to as e ) works .
"now , the particular day care they go to is <#> of the best in <UNK> in my humble opinion ."
they love the staff and the other kids and so we want to keep them there .
"we are , however , slowly going in to debt ."
"so , at e 's <UNK> i began looking for part - time work ."
""" i thought i could easily find work that would , at least in some way , <UNK> my skills ."
"maybe it 's september <#> , or whatever , but i ended up working in a chain coffee joint ."
( not starbucks . ) today was my third day .
"i 'm expected to accept this <UNK> pay , and somehow make this part - time job part of my identity ."
"i do n't , however , want to make it a major part of my life ."
i think this is the most <UNK> part of the work culture in the u.s .
we 're supposed to take these shit jobs and then act like we 're the <UNK> damn people in the world to be working there .
i had to go through <#> interviews to get this job .
"i could n't help thinking , "" i 'm an adult ."
"what more do you want for this kind of pay ? "" <#> damn interviews ."
of course i <UNK> my <UNK> so successfully that they actually hired me .
"so here i am , learning this new job ."
<#> of my <UNK> was n't even born yet when i got my driver 's license .
"all my coworkers are <#> - somethings , although they all seem nice ."
i 'm just not in the same place they are .
"let me tell you , it put me into a depression for several days when i first got the job ."
i kept asking myself how i got to a place where i could do no better than <UNK> coffee for shit pay .
"well , it has n't been as bad as i thought ."
"as e will often point out , i often focus on the <UNK> ."
i still do n't <UNK> the job and i 'm embarassed to tell my friends and family that i work there .
i just had this illusion that i was randy from <UNK> .
i was ready for a <UNK> change in my outlook .
i was ready to do what i needed to do for my family .
"unfortunately i thought it would be something cooler , or more in line with my interests than a job that any <#> year - old could get ."
i guess things do n't happen quite like that in life .
"it works well for fiction , but those kind of changes do n't occur overnight ."
"it 's usually years later that , in <UNK> , we can point to a time or an event that changed our lives or our outlook ."
in the end i guess i did what was right for my family .
so today i 'm feeling better about things .
e is going to kill me if i do n't get some more things done around the house before she gets home .
i do n't know how often i can update this stupid thing .
", i do n't want to abandon it , but i really do n't have time for another hobby ."
you might as well add <UNK> to that list .
"my politics are sometimes radical , my outlook is often <UNK> ."
"i 'm self - <UNK> a lot of the time , i 'm also not afraid to criticize others , at least in my thoughts ."
"i 'm not always nice . with that being said ,"
do n't expect you to always like or agree with what i say .
i certainly do n't expect you to do so .
"i do n't want to argue with anyone , i just want to say what i want to say at the time i 'm saying it ."
"if you do n't like what i 'm saying , do n't read this anymore ."
i 'm hoping this format will be some kind of <UNK> for me to express thoughts i do n't always get to express .
"hopefully once in a great while it will be thought - <UNK> , or even humorous ."
"it 's not even available yet , and wo n't be in the us until next year , but fans of the playstation portable are already urllink eagerly <UNK>"

"on last night 's season - ending episode of urllink <#> , neither michelle nor tony died ."
"while waiting for gmail to become available , i 've been <UNK> all kinds of sites , most <UNK> urllink <UNK> ."
here 's urllink an item that someone wants to <UNK> in trade for a gmail invitation .
i say it 's creative and appealing -- someone should give this guy <#> .
"as i wrote about earlier this month ( may <#> ) , the <UNK> is a device which fits in your pocket but runs full - on windows xp ."
prediction : devices of this size and <UNK> are going to make a big impact to <UNK> and <UNK> alike .
why buy a palm or <UNK> device which has a <UNK> - down operating system when you can bring the full windows os with you ?
"go on vacation , go to the coffee shop , whatever ."
other device makers are also going in this direction as i mentioned on urllink may <#> .
if the makes themselves price these things too high .
"<UNK> they should be in the $ <#> - <#> range , but i predict they 'll be higher ."
most people wo n't buy in at that point .
"at any rate , this is good news for those of us who like our data to go ."
check out this <UNK> program for urllink organizing your movie collection .
you hire a clown named urllink <UNK> the clown and you 're just ripe to be taken for a ride .
urllink <UNK> is nice but offers not much help since it 's <UNK> by people asking for invites .
google 's urllink own blog does n't give any insight at all ( and i would think this would be prime material for a blog ) .
a urllink site in the uk which hosts discussions on all things google is saying that urllink blogger users are getting a new round of invites .
and they do point out the vast number of people signing up for blogger and then creating empty blogs -- not too attractive real estate for our internet neighborhood .
"they call it the urllink <UNK> , from a company called <UNK> ."
he co - founded a little company called microsoft .
i want <#> of these devices ; sadly i just know they 'll cost at least $ <#> and probably more .
sony is urllink preparing to announce <#> and it 's going to go for $ <#> .
just a random blog reading <UNK> has <UNK> something really funny .
check it out at : urllink <#> bad men - a <UNK> .
"check out the urllink washington post article on this , plus some urllink more info here . and"
"then , when you 're ready , you can read a saved copy of urllink her weblog ."
"when signing up for an email service , be careful which <UNK> you choose -- urllink your career may be affected by it ."
"[ side note ] wow , this blog has turned into a post full of email subject matter ."
"ok , fans -- the final episode of urllink <#> season <#> is tonight ."
personally i think either tony or michelle will die .
call it a <UNK> ; we 'll see if it proves correct .
"ok , so now i 'm really getting upset ."
i really want to get my hands on google 's urllink gmail .
i had read that the users of blogger were getting first <UNK> as part of the beta testing ( blogger being owned by google -- makes sense ) .
"so , i had a blogger account that rarely got used , and i started using it , hoping to get the <UNK> and much sought after invitation ."
"so , i figured ( and read someplace else ) that it must be for the very active blogger users who post often ."
"so i was bummed , but at least i thought i had the answer ."
the character of chloe on <#> is <#> which you either love or hate .
"she 's in your face , a bit bitchy and generally <UNK> ."
"however , there is a group of people that apparently urllink think she 's hot ."
"well , after much searching through the internet , i 've come up with a <UNK> on when google 's gmail might be available to the public ."
"so , it seems as if a <UNK> solution is my best bet , at least until the spam situation dies down ( if ever ) ."
"i 'd love to get it , but so far i 've only found <#> references as to when it might be available to the whole world ."
i really do n't want to wait that long .
"so , it looks like some of the cast of <#> urllink wo n't be back next season ."
i 'd love to see her get the <UNK> .
"so , would you urllink give up a kidney for a gmail account ?"
check out urllink gmail <UNK> for this and other <UNK> .
"actually , i 'm just <UNK> around on the net and ran across this so figured i 'd post it ."
"palm has urllink won their case against <UNK> , who claimed they stole the <UNK> <UNK> recognition system , <UNK> , from them ."
"i believe this was an appeals case , so it will be interesting to see what happens next ."
"rumors are swirling about urllink dell possibly wanting to acquire <UNK> , the arm of palm that makes the hardware devices ."
"in effect , most fans had thought the worst had passed ."
"so , then , the question : why a <UNK> now ? and can <UNK> effectively hold the <UNK> at the door and say "" no thanks "" ?"
an interesting article from urllink fortune magazine on the new sony <UNK> and the nintendo ds .
sources now say that urllink a parts <UNK> may <UNK> supply of the newly <UNK> sony playstation portable ( <UNK> ) and the nintendo ds .
<UNK> actually looking <UNK> to getting <#> of these .
going price as of this writing is $ <#> .
"according to the <UNK> , it will make you popular with the women ."
"a bit of a stretch , do n't you think ?"
a new report coming out soon argues whether or not <UNK> <UNK> really invented linux .
"according to the report , he was strongly influenced by another operating system , <UNK> , created by andrew <UNK> at <UNK> university in <UNK> ."
"the report argues whether or not <UNK> , a student , could have actually come up with linux himself in such a short time ."
i 'm still looking around for a new email service .
i may actually have to wait until urllink google 's gmail is released to the public .
"after everything i 've read , i think that 's the service i want to use ."
i at least want to give it a try .
"after all , they 're giving their users a urllink full <UNK> of space now ( up from the <UNK> <UNK> which they started out"
<UNK> it 's still <UNK> whether that limit will stay .
"i was hoping that since i 'm using blogger now , google would offer me the chance to sign up for gmail ."
"that 's what was reported by many blogger users , but so far no window has popped up which offers this ."
"maybe it will happen later , or maybe i 'll just sign up when the <UNK> open ."
lots of you may be wondering what this is all about .
"a whole new format , audio links ... what is up ?"
i 'm <UNK> with a new format and new content <UNK> system for the revision bar .
"however , with the hand coding and manual <UNK> of the server came certain restrictions ."
"that proved harder than i thought , and so i started looking around ."
urllink blogger provides that <UNK> and much more .
check it out : the ability to post from any pc via a web browser .
the entries get saved as <UNK> files and your site visitors can listen to your audio posts .
there 's <#> on this site right now .
"after a month , all the content goes from the front page to an archive section to make room for the newer stuff . automatically ."
"so , the bottom line is i 'm trying this format out , and i encourage you to also ."
"for now though , i encourage you to browse the page , check out some of the links , and definitely try the comments section ."
"it 's the <#> feature i 'm the most pumped about , because it could give me good feedback about who 's reading this site ."
"if people comment , i can begin to get a feel for who my readers are and what they 'd like to see ."
"we can also get that whole community thing going , which i think is essential to a good site ."
"enjoy it , and let me know what you think ."
this is a test post from my email account .
"men , feel free to use your urllink cell phones ."
"urllink barbie has dumped ken , her <UNK> boyfriend , for an australian <UNK> dude named <UNK> ."
a new find at the historic <UNK> <UNK> in virginia shows that they had <UNK> and apparently urllink performed surgery to relieve pain .
<#> such <UNK> which appears to have holes <UNK> in him to relieve pain has been found .
"hotmail is now saying it 's going to urllink up the limit for it 's users , at least the paying ones ."
maybe we could have all used this years ago ?
"scientists have successfully broken down the <UNK> state , the state that describes the properties of matter , of <#> atom and <UNK> it to another ."
"in theory , this could mean that urllink <UNK> could be possible ."
"went on a trip yesterday to the <UNK> , nj location of urllink <UNK> times ."
"lots of <UNK> , horses and fighting , and <UNK> ."
all in all a great show and well worth the price of admission .
remember there 's no knives and <UNK> ( eat with your hands <UNK> ) and do yourself a favor by visiting the <UNK> <UNK> exhibit .
lots of good old fashioned torture devices for your viewing pleasure .
"to my surprise , i now have <#> mb and a newer interface ."
"however , for some reason , my other yahoo account , which is much older ( opened somewhere around <#> ) , has not gotten the space increase yet ."
i choose to think that it 's option number <#> .
"for all you urllink yahoo mail users , go check out your inbox and see what 's up ."
there may be a big surprise waiting for you .
looks like yahoo 's urllink <UNK> the <UNK> for it 's free email service today .
"<UNK> will get <#> mb , and yahoo says it 's going to clean up the interface , which has long been <UNK> as <UNK> with advertising ."
"this is yahoo 's attempt to <UNK> google 's urllink gmail , or at least keep the <UNK> it has ."
"i just checked my yahoo account , but the limit has n't been raised yet ."
"oh , yeah , i 'm on urllink gmail now baby !"
"have n't had hardly any time to play with it yet , but i 'm in there ."
now comes the hard work of switching all my <UNK> <UNK> so they point to my new gmail account .
then we 'll see how well it holds up under some stress .
no funky numbers or anything that 's hard to remember .
"a big thanks to "" <UNK> "" who gave it to me at urllink <UNK> ."
"she 'll be posting soon to this site , but for now you can check out her existing blogs urllink here and urllink here ."
this time i actually thought up something good i could offer at <UNK> .
previously i did n't know what i would put up for grabs .
check out urllink what i offered here .
"within <#> <UNK> , i had someone say "" i 'll take that offer "" ."
just for kicks i looked up urllink gmail <UNK> on ebay .
there are reports of <#> guy last night selling <#> for $ <#> .
maybe that 's what is <UNK> all this activity .
the bbc has a story claiming urllink <UNK> has been found .
"hmm ... over at urllink the giving tree , i 'm now number <#> in line to get a gmail invitation ."
strange ... when i signed up i was number <#> .
"in my quest for a better email provider , i decided yesterday to try urllink <UNK> ."
what i 'm left with now is an account that i 'll probably never use and will hopefully get deleted after a period of <UNK> .
"it 's just that the service is slow , and the interface is pretty bare bones and not attractive to use at all ."
"it does n't seem to support much , if any , html mail , and you certainly ca n't <UNK> an html mail ."
an interesting side note is that urllink yahoo mail is looking better and better as i compare it to all the others .
"although i predict gmail will still be better overall , yahoo 's combination of a real decent spam filter and support for html messages really make it shine ."
"it 's actually quite fast too , and when they increase everyone 's <UNK> to <#> mb this summer , it will really be a <UNK> ."
"i do n't think it will be better than gmail , but maybe these <UNK> of features will be appealing ."
a few days ago i mentioned that i 've sold my <UNK> devices and am currently <UNK> .
the experience has been interesting to say the least .
"the devices are expensive , and are seen as geek tools ."
"neither of which i like , and both of which i 'd like to avoid ."
"so , i ditched my old devices and decided to see if i could go it alone ."
i find myself reaching for <#> to check my calendar .
"it 's frustrating at times and i find myself thinking "" just go to the store , pick out a new <#> and move on "" ."
"the <#> i would want would have to have wireless internet <UNK> ( <UNK> ) <UNK> , and they 're not cheap ."
"whereas you can get a basic <UNK> for $ <#> , i do n't want <#> of those ."
"i just sold <#> devices that were better than that , so why settle ?"
"we 'll see in time if i can actually live without <#> , or if i crack and buy something ."
"( although there may be a notice saying anonymous posts are not allowed , they are in fact fine ."
"you know , just in case i decide to buy . :-)"
yesterday i <UNK> the main revision bar page over to the new blogger template .
"after using blogger for about a month , and figuring out how it works and what the benefits were , i decided to take the <UNK> ."
it 's definitely a network - <UNK> approach to doing things .
"i can edit this site using any computer , and that 's a good thing ."
"i find that all in all , i post more often simply due to the simplicity <UNK> me by the blogger <UNK> ."
i also hooked in the older pages ( pre blogger ; feb .
so you 'll still be able to access those .
i chose a new template using blogger so the old pages and the newer ones basically match .
"there are some differences , but not terrible ."
look for the older pages on the right hand side under archives -- older archives .
hopefully you 'll enjoy the new look as i do .
this site has always been an <UNK> thing for me . a way to test new things out and see what works .
"although i will miss hand - coding everything , this will be fun for awhile and offers many advantages , such as the ability for you to leave comments ."
"although no <#> has done so yet , i hope to get some feedback in time and build up a nice <UNK> with whoever reads these pages ."
"while continuing my search for urllink gmail , i found a new site called urllink the giving tree ."
it 's a site where people who want gmail can put their name on the list .
people who are current gmail users can see your name on the list and send you your invite .
i put my name on the list and was told there are <#> people ahead of me .
"i 've been waiting weeks already , what 's a few more days or so ?"
i 've also read that google has decided to open up more invitations and have given each current gmail member <#> more invitations .
"if true , that 's good news for me and makes my odds of getting <#> better ."
"the <UNK> movie urllink <UNK> me is making a big splash at the box office already , and it 's only been released to a small number of theaters ."
"some of us ( ahem , ahem ) have been saying for years that fast food places like mcdonalds are bad for your health ."
there 's new warnings that urllink al qaeda will attack <UNK> .
apparently nothing can bring me closer to this goal .
i 'm stuck waiting it out for the entire summer .
"it 's too bad , because i could really use it to <UNK> all my different accounts ."
it would be big enough that i could hopefully go down to just <#> .
"this is kansas , and it 's tornado town ."
this woman apparently thought the correct thing to do was to go to the urllink bathroom .
i 've sold all my recent goodies on ebay .
"my urllink palm <UNK> t , my urllink <UNK> <UNK> ."
"with both these devices gone , i now have no more <UNK> to help organize my life ."
"i 'm thinking about a new palm <UNK> , or maybe an hp <UNK> ."
and i was pretty much set on a <UNK> .
"rumors are that the prices on the <UNK> will be going down now to clear out the stock , but i 'm still not sure . buying on now"
just means it 's a dead device with no future .
looks like i wo n't be buying a urllink sony <UNK> <UNK> in the future .
"just an fyi , still looking to get into urllink gmail . and"
"seems invitations are very hard to come by , which may explain why urllink ebay 's been so busy lately ."
"urllink <UNK> , a site where people can <UNK> post pictures of themselves and other things that catch their interest ."
"pictures taken while out and about with cell phones are popular on this site , as are nude or <UNK> pictures , for some reason ."
"if you 're into <UNK> , check it out or start posting ."
check out this letter from the <UNK> 's <UNK> to superman .
"as if having everything you 'd ever need for maintaining your home is n't enough , now they 're offering urllink this ."
i have n't posted about urllink gmail much since getting it from <UNK> at urllink <UNK> .
i guess i 've had it a little less than a month now and it 's just fantastic .
"i 've totally dumped my old email account , despite it being a <UNK> <UNK> and being able to download messages and read them offline ."
"the heck with that , i now say , since i got so much spam that what i was actually downloading most of the time were viruses ."
"so , now i use gmail and go through the web and it 's fast ."
it 's so fast i hardly notice any difference in speed between using it and <UNK> .
"and with <UNK> the storage is , for the most part , unlimited . or"
"at least i 'll never have to worry about reaching my limit for say , the next <#> - <#> years or more ."
many privacy <UNK> are unhappy with the <UNK> ads that appear <UNK> with the messages .
"some even have set up sites <UNK> how urllink "" creepy "" gmail is ."
"to <UNK> , who gave me the account , i simply say thank you ."
"it took me a while to create the cd full of software i promised at <UNK> , but i mailed it yesterday so it should be there soon ."
"you 're urllink globe - hopping right now anyway , as <UNK> in your blog , so hopefully you have n't missed it too much ."
"loved the urllink balloon animals , by the way ."
martin has some links on an issue that is crucial to me in a very personal sense - urllink <UNK> .
he also urllink sets very high standards for his <UNK> - and includes me .
i 'm a bit <UNK> - i guess i 'll have to live up to it .
this means i 'll have to read urllink george <UNK> 's politics and the english language .
"i agree with most of his points , though i have to admit that links from my <UNK> to amazon will earn me some <UNK> ."
"anyway , you can find out more about the <UNK> urllink here than you probably ever wanted to ."
"everything is in italian though - the presidency did not think <UNK> might be interested , obviously ."
"in theory there 's a "" hear the anthem "" link , but does n't seem to work ."
"oh , well ... not too depressing after all ..."
election day local elections in italy this past weekend .
"'s fucking depressing , is what it is . '"
"i guess not many of you can whistle it , eh ?"
it 's close to a well - kept national secret .
and it takes a lot to <UNK> <UNK> .
"anna <UNK> was prepared to me more <UNK> with <UNK> 19th century <UNK> "" ."
"the translation gives but a pale idea : "" brothers of italy , italy <UNK> woken up of <UNK> 's helmet it <UNK> surrounded its <UNK> where is victory ?"
"let she offer her <UNK> that she is a slave of rome , god created her ! """
most people are uncertain at what exactly this means .
"according to anna <UNK> , no , no , no : "" god made victory a slave of rome "" is the correct reading ."
"so , the last <#> lines would be : where is victory ?"
"there are a few more verses too , and they ai n't bad either ;-) they do n't get sung very often , for some reason ..."
"the second verse starts : the children of italy are all called <UNK> , the blast of every trumpet is a signal for the <UNK> ..."
"( "" the <UNK> "" were a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> a few centuries back ."
""" <UNK> "" was a local boy who started a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> by throwing stones at the police ;-) ."
"however , "" <UNK> "" was also the name for <#> of the age - groups of the <UNK> party 's youth organization . )"
"( another age - group was "" children of the she - wolf "" -- i swear ;-) )"
"so text is difficult , close to <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> key words ..."
"the vast majority of italian do n't know the words past the first <UNK> , and a lot of them do n't know the first <UNK> either ."
but lately there has been a <UNK> of patriotic feeling .
this has been a pet <UNK> of the current president of the republic .
"the president was pleased , an has been <UNK> the singing of the <UNK> since then . being a widely respected figure"
", people have sort of <UNK> their feet and <UNK> a half - hearted promise to try to learn the words ."
"anyway , at every interview they get asked if they will sing it this time around , and each time they <UNK> their feet and <UNK> ."
"i mean - if the italian anthem were "" urllink va ' <UNK> "" , i 'd consent to sing it , despite my little enthusiasm for patriotism ."
"not only is "" va ' <UNK> "" a wonderful piece of music , it is also much closer to values and emotions i 'd feel inclined to share ."
"the longing for a home that is lost and in ruins , for example - it would be difficult to find a more appropriate theme for an italian anthem ."
"unfortunately , our pet <UNK> party , the <UNK> , has <UNK> it ."
"so , no luck changing the anthem there ."
but the fundamental fact is that i think that patriotism is anti - italian .
"the fundamental lack of enthusiasm for all the <UNK> of <UNK> , and military pride ."
this is a good thing in a nation that has listened to high - <UNK> ' <UNK> <UNK> once too often already .
"and so , basically , i think that singing a <UNK> anthem that <UNK> italy 's greatness is , well ... <UNK> ."
a <UNK> of the best values this country has managed to <UNK> from its shame .
"however <UNK> <UNK> , a young and <UNK> italian actor , has given me an alternative ."
it 's simply an alternative lyrics and it 's just perfect in its self - <UNK> <UNK> - very italian .
"it goes like this : <UNK> <UNK> ben <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ( brothers of italy , we 'd settle for little ) la"
"a woman , and a joint ) ma , <UNK> !"
now this is a real anthem worthy of the particular soul of this country .
"it 's got the cars , the sex , and the tendency to take rules less than seriously ."
and it 's <UNK> effort to send up gravity and to thumb <#> 's nose at <UNK> .
who knows the real measure of their own patriotism ?
"those who know me may ask : "" how is that possible , gary"
"? you do n't even have a girlfriend . """
"well , i will tell you : my niece is coming down to visit for a week or <#> ( <#> , hopefully ) ."
"listening to : i ca n't get "" the d "" out of my head or off my windows media player ."
""" <UNK> "" , from their cd , is <#> of theirs that i 've been listening to over and over again ."
"at <#> point , <#> of them <UNK> out their <UNK> ; though i 'm not sure who ."
the whole thing ends with that david dark guy getting <UNK> on by <UNK> .
"on the stereo in my room , i 've been playing a lot of <UNK> , mostly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ."
"reading : kurt <UNK> jr 's "" <UNK> <#> "" , a very creative and interesting book ."
""" whose line is it anyway ? "" , howard stern , and "" politically incorrect "" ."
"a nice <UNK> of news , sports and dick jokes ."
"plus i downloaded a few <UNK> songs , and am currently <UNK> to hear some <UNK> ."
eating : still on my <UNK> - a - day diet and doing okay with it .
"i eat <#> meal a day , and can have pretty much anything i want ( pizza , to my utter sadness , is off limits ) ."
i 'm surprised how well i am doing with it actually .
"i had was the week my cat died and even then , i did n't go <UNK> like i well could have in that circumstance ."
drinking a little too much pepsi though ( with my meal ) .
"normally i 'd just make iced tea with equal in it , which is better for me than pepsi , but i get lazy"
"sometimes ( this is what 's called an "" <UNK> "" ) ."
the daniel pearl execution video i just watched the daniel pearl <UNK> video and i am pissed .
"and they must be dealt with , especially now , because the threat is very , very real ."
"but mainly , i feel , it is important that we , as americans , see the video because we need a dose of reality ."
"it 's a different world now , and americans are targets ."
we can no longer travel anywhere in the world as simple tourists .
"as of <UNK> 11th , hunting season on americans is open and"
"once again , religion <UNK> it 's ugly head ."
they made him make <UNK> statements about america 's support of israel as well ; all the more reason why americans should see this video .
the people we are dealing with over there are not so different from the nazis we fought in wwii except they are <UNK> and less organized .
just what the world needs : third world nazis .
did i mention that they are <UNK> as well ?
"i do n't mean to be so <UNK> , but how much more <UNK> a demand could there be , especially at this point in time ?"
"look , the middle east is a mess and it always has been ."
"to be honest , it need n't be our business to change things over there anyway ."
"if it were n't for their precious oil , we probably would n't need to have anything to do with those people at all ."
"what we need , more than anything else , is to change things here ."
we need to find and <UNK> alternative fuel sources and we need to stop buying oil from the middle east .
"let 's get the folks who are responsible for what happened on <#> , and then let 's get the hell out of there ."
"let them do to themselves what they will , and lets just take care of america and our fellow americans ."
"and how did we , as americans ( myself included ) , "" pay tribute "" to those people ?"
"if so many <UNK> men ( and some women ) had n't died on the <UNK> throughout the years , would our lives be the same today ?"
"perhaps , instead of watching "" friends "" on thursday nights , we 'd be <UNK> in to a show called "" <UNK> "" ."
downloaded <UNK> songs and <UNK> 's new cd from <UNK> .
"took a few moments to remember the folks who died throughout the years , <UNK> me to do all of these things today ."
"rocking with <UNK> and <UNK> my memorial day weekend , thus far , has been spent almost entirely sitting on my ass in front of the pc ."
jack black is becoming <#> of my favorites ; it seems he can just about do anything and do it well .
last night they re - ran the saturday night live episode he hosted awhile back .
"i thought he was great throughout the show , which was a pretty good <#> by <UNK> standards ."
"plus , "" the d "" appeared on the show as well ."
i guess watching that put me in the mood for some <UNK> and <UNK> tunes tonight .
"ok , i 'm out of here ; it 's way past my bedtime and"
i have a lot of sitting on my ass to do tomorrow .
in praise of .... tommy lee ? ! ? ! ?
"in my last post i touched on "" the <UNK> down of america "" , and in this <#> i am going to praise the new tommy lee cd ."
"not so much the song , but tommy himself , and his guitarist ."
"tommy 's vocals were pretty rough , but that did n't bother me much ."
"what did bother me was that , quite often , he would adopt a pseudo - british accent when he sang ."
"his guitarist bothered me too , but not for his looks or his behaviour , but because his guitar playing sucked ."
it all seemed weird and out of place in the song anyway .
"luckily , in the cd 's mix , the guitar ( and everything else ) comes together in a <UNK> manner and sounds just right ."
"i would recommend tommy lee 's "" never a dull moment "" cd to most people ."
"by no means is it another "" electric <UNK> "" or "" physical <UNK> "" , but it 's a very enjoyable listen , and that 's good enough ."
"no more i am extremely disappointed that "" politically incorrect "" has been cancelled ."
"we hear the term "" the <UNK> down of america "" , and this is just <#> more step down that road ."
"worse yet , i heard that "" pi "" is being replaced by a new show starring ... jimmy <UNK> ."
he spoke for a lot of us whose views are considered minority <UNK> .
"for that , i 'd like to say "" thanks , bill "" . """

nightmare warning : not for the <UNK> ! !
i had a really bad dream last night which really gave me the <UNK> .
it 's probably the most <UNK> dream i can ever remember having .
i dreamt that i had a mass of tiny pin - sized white worms boring holes into my body while i desperately tried pulling them out .
i was throwing them to the side in giant <UNK> .
some <UNK> out through tiny <UNK> holes on my legs and belly and i pulled them out
", some came out , but some broke off inside ."
"at <#> point , i pulled a giant worm out from near my ribs and was shocked at how large and <UNK> it was ."
"as i pulled it out of my body , i could see the rest of it pulling out under my skin ."
"while i was <UNK> that <#> , the little ones were still working ."
they ate my right <UNK> almost hollow and through a hole in the skin ( more like a tear )
"i could see them <UNK> around inside , eating me alive ."
"i kept reaching into the hole , pulling out worms ; sometimes <UNK> of them , looking like bloody spaghetti ."
"i kept getting the feeling that i was being overcome , that resistance was futile , that i was a <UNK> for sure ."
"i am not a dream <UNK> , but i know this <#> ca n't be too good ."
my guess is that it 's about dying and the <UNK> of death .
"maybe it 's a <UNK> of a terminal disease , like cancer , for instance ."
"but then again , maybe it 's just a dream and nothing more ."
"i do n't know , but it gives me the <UNK> to think about it ."
"it 's all <UNK> , but <#> thing is a definite <UNK>"
"reading : i 'm more than halfway into robert louis <UNK> 's "" the strange case of <UNK> and <UNK> "" , written in <#> ."

"i found a website just now where you can urllink read the book online , which is pretty cool !"

in recent years <UNK> has been putting some black and white artwork back - in an <UNK> title i think <UNK> and changes of pace work .
<UNK> back when the uk had a full comic industry lots of work was printed in <UNK> ( single spot colour plus black )
- i put the blue in later just before <UNK> it cus i could :)
i dunno if my cap britain made the final cut ( <UNK> ?

i 'm wondering how long it will be before someone writes a book about gmail .
urllink this is the upper part of the success screen after signing up for gmail
"urllink after signing up for gmail , this tease splash screen comes up ."
urllink here 's an example of what it looks like when you have a <UNK> message with gmail . in this case there are <#> messages in the thread .
urllink urllink <UNK> is wondering when somebody will send some email to his shiny new gmail address .
"he also asks about spam , but i do n't think he really wants to receive any spam ."
i am going to send him a quick hello note .
"hey , there 's effective weight loss now available do n't you just love scanning email subject lines ?"
these are so obviously spam that i would never click through to any of them .
"ok , well , <#> % as of the <UNK> below ... but i 'm guessing later today it will be <#> % ."
"urllink so here is where i 'm at on gmail space , just <#> hours shy of <#> week ."
"i 'm sure when the <#> hours is up , i 'll be at <UNK> which will be <#> % of my gmail <UNK> ."
"remember , this is my normal email <UNK> from a couple <UNK> , this is n't me encouraging spam or signing up for special accounts ."
here 's my urllink original blog entry last week when i turned on the switch .
i 'll continue to monitor this and update this until the space is gone .
"urllink the blogger , urllink <UNK> girl really wants a gmail account and is listing the top <#> reasons she should be getting <#> ."
urllink reading gmail - is the advertising really that <UNK> ?
"compare that to <UNK> into yahoo groups and , well , there is no comparison ."
""" you know what the difference between gmail , and yahoo , and hotmail is ?"
( besides the fact you get <UNK> of storage in gmail ) .
it 's not like it 's going to spit out dollar bills through your cd <UNK> drive every time you log in .
"it 's the search , mon , the <UNK> ."
"it is that magic , <UNK> component that yahoo and msn have yet to be able to <UNK> as successfully ."
"urllink <UNK> asks : "" i mean , do i really need yet another email address ?"
"gmail is different than "" just another email account "" ... is it better or worse ?"
( i need to b - roll this as well ) the atom feed for this blog is located here :
urllink gmail <UNK> - tips and tricks for using gmail ( i need to b - roll this <#> )
i did something i do n't remember ever doing before a couple days ago : i actually responded to spam received to my gmail account asking for more information .
i thought the whole point with spam was to get people that were interested .
"so , here i respond to some spam with interest and i get ignored ? what 's up with that ?"
"no , i 'm not going to run down the <UNK> and send a follow - up email ."
"btw , i just noticed when i went to post , this blog was listed first"
so i did n't have to choose from the <UNK> menu .
urllink things that ... make you go hmm - google flirting with <UNK> e - mail limit for gmail ?
": "" google must just have hard disk space to burn or something if they are contemplating offering folks a <UNK> of storage ..."
"urllink gmail <UNK> : "" tells the people with gmail about the people without . """
google lists some of their reviews that gmail has received on their gmail site .
"urllink gmail news reviews urllink blog posts darn , too bad this page is a <UNK> !"
"i would have thought a link off of most any google page is <UNK> , <#> or <#> , although i guess <UNK> is <UNK> ."
"however , <UNK> mails still still got through , even at "" <#> mb ( <#> % ) of my <#> mb "" ."
could it be gmail storage is in fact unlimited ?
my current mailbox stats : you are currently using <#> mb ( <#> % ) of your <#> mb : <#> spam <#> legitimate
""" it will be interesting to see how this <#> shakes out ."
i have been using gmail and gmail <UNK> when writing in this blog .
"this is a stupid little detail , or is it ..."
"in the title of this blog i did n't use the capital m , but pretty much since that time i 've used it ."
yesterday i started <UNK> an email address since <#> to gmail and also several of our <UNK> through gmail .
it 's not all of my email but it 's a good chunk of what i receive daily .
this is sort of my own internal test like urllink <UNK> is running .
"spam received for first day , saturday <UNK> : <#> gmail <UNK> me : you are currently using <#> mb ( <#> % ) of your <#> mb ."
"guess this means at this rate i 'll have about <#> days before i 'm out of space , does n't it ?"
"i have n't published my gmail address anywhere , including here ."
i 'll have more to say about the spam and how to deal with it in gmail in future entries .
time to be <UNK> at gmail by the spam !
i have now went in and set <UNK> for several <UNK> to start testing how good -- or bad -- the gmail <UNK> are for spam <UNK> .
"things like once they get their site listed they take down the <UNK> link , <UNK> the submitted url , changing the site , etc ."
this also got me wondering about the <UNK> of these claims .
it is true that if someone wants a free email address they are available easily .
when i signed up for yahoo i opted not to receive the email address .
we also do not use our cable email address at this time .
we never used the dsl <#> either for our office or home .
at least now i 'm using it as a way to better manage some of my email .
will i go away from it once it becomes available to the masses ?
"perhaps for regular usage , but i still like the search aspect of it and i think it is easily better than yahoo or hotmail ."
i 'm still getting used to it though and i still have a bunch of <UNK> to share when i get to it .
"urllink things that ... make you go hmm yahoo free email storage to increase to <UNK> <UNK> = "" virtually unlimited "" ?"
"but hey , it 's cool for yahoo users that they get that much more space ."
do yahoo free email users have gmail to thank or is this just an odd coincidence ?
recently there has been a discussion on the blogger user support group about gmail not mixing with yahoo email addresses .
"when switching yahoo groups addresses from previous emails to google gmail addresses , the gmail spam filter automatically filed the yahoo <UNK> emails as spam . """
"took a little bit , but this blog is finally listed at <UNK> :"

"also <UNK> suggests that the beta period will be "" <#> to <#> months "" : how long do you think this beta feedback process is going to be ?"
i think it 'll take <#> to <#> months or so .
we 're getting a lot of good feedback ; we 've already made a number of changes .
"probably the big ones are feature requests that we need to deal with , and there are some significant ones there ."
i do n't know how many of those we 'll be able to get in prior to making it more <UNK> available .
blogger updated today and added a fresh coat of paint and comments <UNK> .
i think they are still working on it because comments are n't showing up even after i edited the template and <UNK> inside the admin area .
i 'll give it a day or so and then re - enable <UNK> if they do n't get it sorted out .

urllink ever run out of memory and see your google search bar like this ?

urllink this here is a wonderfully funny article in the wall street journal <UNK> about <#> item in particular -- <UNK> -- and its pattern recognition habits .
"if you care to look at this article a little more closely , you 'll find that it 's actually about artificial intelligence and consumer <UNK> ."

"i do n't care who you are or where you work , the fact that i 'm taking home <#> boxes of <UNK> cookies affects no <#> but me ."
right now there 's a lot of data <UNK> going on .
and it 's this <UNK> of information under the <UNK> of consumer benefit that has me concerned .
no more need for us <UNK> to see those annoying veggie - burger ads .
the facts are that air miles et al are making ridiculous amount of money tracking spending habits and releasing this data to third parties .

you mean i 'm being questioned over the <UNK> cups i bought in december and the <UNK> i bought in april ?

"in fact , i enjoy filling out <UNK> and giving companies feedback ."
"i promise you , if the product is good it will sell itself ."
urllink urllink urllink urllink everyone knows i play <UNK> .
there was an urllink article in discover a few years ago about computers playing board games .
the subject is always near the front of my mind as it often comes up in <UNK> -- how well does the best computer play ?
"in <UNK> , the top computers play almost as well as the top humans ."
"now , this discover article is about <#> years old , but not much has changed despite the fact the computers have gotten more <UNK> ."
this all grew from a post in wired news about ibm 's new computer that 's as urllink fast as a human brain .
"then , the last line in urllink another article brought me full - circle , and thinking about urllink <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i also looked at urllink this article on <UNK> from the american <UNK> <UNK> .
"i 'm attracted to it , and it does n't show up often enough ."
"when i read about someone with an incredible gift , i am <UNK> by it ."

"there 's a right to die rant in there somewhere , but i 'm going to let it lie ."
"well , here it is : the first post in my blog ."
"i suppose every blog starts out this way -- but believe me , i 'm not going to be <UNK> ."
"with <UNK> attending <UNK> as <UNK> 's adult <UNK> , i was forced to take her place on the radio today ."
"i was on <UNK> <#> , <UNK> community radio , talking about <UNK> on <UNK> ."
"<UNK> said , "" you 've been here a long time , you know what the deal is ."
"however , fine is always the bare minimum in my life ."
"to be worthy , everything i do has to be <UNK> ."
i was n't able to put my finger on it until i was driving back to the office .
"there is a subtle art to the <UNK> of questions : that is , giving an answer without answering at all ."
"some <UNK> are inherently good at it , and it 's <#> of the skills that debate <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , as a former <UNK> , is good at it ."
"<UNK> , as a non - <UNK> , needs practice ."
as a for instance : i was asked if <UNK> also involves groups other than students in our programs .
"later on , i was asked how <#> of <UNK> 's <UNK> placed at worlds ."
"as i did n't have that information with me , and i had no idea , i said that i did n't know ."
"better would have been that i did n't know , but that attending worlds alone showed the amount of effort and dedication he had put into his activities ."
the important thing is that next time i will be all the better .
"i 'm still around , not to worry ; the holiday <UNK> has not claimed me yet ."
but this will be my last post before heading home for the holidays .
the reason for my absence is that i was slowly working on a story -- i have this theory about all blogs heading toward a state of <UNK> .
but as it 's currently in a state of <UNK> i thought i 'd make what might be my last post of <#> .
"dr . laura was <UNK> from her mother for a number of years -- he mother 's choice , she says --"
and her lack of a family life was <#> of the reasons she pushed so hard for family values .
"there are other ways to look at this , of course : dr ."
"laura 's lack of a traditional family unit did n't prevent her from reaching success , such as it is ."
perhaps appropriate role models and the proper spin of life 's ups and downs are more important in the long run ?
"an older , wiser <UNK> shapes a younger person into a responsible adult ?"
but the topic of this post is that some of us get the choice to spend the holidays with our families and some of us do n't .
"some of us like spending the holidays with our families , and some of us do n't ."
"but it 's great to be able to have that kind of choice , and it 's awful when we yearn so strongly for what we once had ."
"yeah , i do n't really <UNK> the idea of spending the holidays with my family ."
"i , like everyone , should try and keep this in perspective ."
"before i forget again , i wanted to post something on god - given talents ."
"he also happens to be a christian <UNK> and , oddly enough , he <UNK> about god ."
this is fine -- whatever makes his bed rock and all that -- but i have to wonder what 's going through his head while he <UNK> .
does he feel god 's spirit moving through him ?
does feel that he 's going to convert someone to christianity through his rap ?
"i <UNK> with a friend <#> day , "" you know , i 've been an <UNK> all my life , but your rap really changed my mind ."
""" i seriously think he 's waiting for this scenario to play out ."
i expect him to say that his <UNK> talent is god - given .
so this got me thinking about what exactly is a god - given talent .
"if so , what about a talent like walking and chewing gum ?"
what if i was the best there ever was at walking and chewing gum ?
i 'm just hoping that my god - given walking and gum - chewing talent will show people the light .
what if i could point out physical or mental flaws with people ? is that a god - given talent ?
what about the ability to steal anything and not get caught ?
what about if i was able to kill people better than anyone who 's ever lived ?
"the answer came to me as i was stuffing <UNK> , of all things ."
it all ends up being a matter of perspective . walking and chewing gum
"may not be a god - given talent , but perhaps <UNK> is ."
"<UNK> may not qualify , but maybe <UNK> does ."
"and anyway , it all remains a matter of perspective : you see what you want to see . """
"only god could create such an awesome ability ! "" or "" oh crap , here comes that rap guy again ."
"i 'm sure the devil put him here to annoy me . """
i 've got to start being less self - conscious about what i 'm writing .
"maybe this blogging thing , like all things , just comes with time ."
"how do you get to <UNK> hall ? "" he asks ."
today i was <UNK> through what i believe was the october <#> issue of rolling stone .
inside they had a brief review of kurt <UNK> 's diary .
"the review is positive overall , and they share a few <UNK> about the content -- <#> of them being that he consistently <UNK> <UNK> as "" <UNK> "" ."
a few things ran through my head as i read that .
"firstly , i largely regard gross <UNK> as a sign of intellectual weakness ."
"but this is <UNK> we 're talking about -- maybe not the <UNK> knife in the drawer , but certainly no idiot !"
my second thought was that maybe i was being too hard on the guy .
"language is a tool for effective communication , not a method <UNK> you should <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> ."
"sure , even with the worst <UNK> and <UNK> , you can certainly get the <UNK> of whatever it is someone is trying to get across ."
but i do n't believe we should continue to settle for the least possible effort .
i do n't believe that we should continue to let the bar be set at <UNK> .
i tend to be a <UNK> about such things .
"and i want to speak well , mostly because , like everyone , i wish to be understood ."
"i recently met someone who is as much a <UNK> as i am , and whenever she points out <#> of my mistakes i am <UNK> ."
"i do n't want to be <UNK> as an idiot -- but then again , by blogging is n't there a danger of <UNK> myself ?"
he was able to string words together to describe thoughts and feelings that were previously only vague terms and wild <UNK> .
"he showed us that , although it 's nothing more than a system of <UNK> agreed on sounds , language can be beautiful ."
forgive me if i respect the man and his medium .
it occurs to me today -- just now -- that this blog is me .
since they 've gained popularity they 've become more on - line journals than alternative news sources .
i did n't want to stray too much from the original formula .
"but the problem was that this blog , like most things in my life , lacked focus and direction ."
"this blog is my life , my opinions , my commentary ."
so i 'm reading in wired news about urllink world aids day and the link and think campaign .
although everyone is familiar with aids few stop to actually measure the social impact that the disease has .
"as has been said in more <UNK> <UNK> , these people are your brothers , your sisters , your parents , your friends ."
"<#> <#> people is just a <UNK> number , but to put it in context is to clarify the awful power of this virus ."
"although i currently do n't know anyone now who has aids , odds are strong that <#> day i will ."
"if we want to stop the spread , education and awareness are our greatest resources ."
urllink a story <UNK> in the article is a must read .
"it 's well - written , <UNK> , tragic , <UNK> ."
a story of hope and salvation in the midst of despair .
it 's these kinds of stories we need to share .
we need to put a human face on this monster .
"funny , i thought my last post was also my last post ; good thing i always have things to talk about ."
i was at the library book sale today and i picked up a book called urllink god does n't believe in <UNK> by ray comfort .
"i only got to read the first <#> pages during lunch , but it 's already completely insulting to anyone who is actually searching for truth ."
it occurs to me that the <UNK> have far more to gain than the <UNK> and <UNK> .
"they move under this <UNK> of salvation , but really they do n't want to be alone , like a child in the dark ."
"the more people they can gather to their side of the argument , the less alone they feel and the more justified their position ."
why do you think they always talk to you in greater numbers ?
where 's the non - religious or anti - religious programming on sunday morning television ?
i was at home <#> day when the <UNK> rang .
"outside were <#> pretty young <UNK> women -- perhaps both looking for a husband , i could n't say ."
"anyway , they asked me what religion i was , and i told them i was an <UNK> . """
"so you do n't believe in god ? "" the <#> said ."
""" no , "" i replied , "" i believe that the fundamental question about god 's <UNK> is <UNK> ."

"again , this is an interesting <UNK> : if you ca n't strong - arm them , and you ca n't reason with them , scare them ."
"i 'm not trying to say that my beliefs are right for everyone , or anyone , or even myself ."
"i 've had a <UNK> of beliefs that have lead me down the road i 'm on , and i 'm sure they will <UNK> further ."
but i <UNK> people telling me that what i believe is wrong when they themselves do n't know any more than i do .
i <UNK> that my freedom of belief is <UNK> by these religious groups .
i <UNK> that i am asked to support my beliefs when i accept theirs <UNK> .

the problem is that there are n't a lot of films where you get to see a naked man .

<#> of the more interesting quotes i 've ever read .
i may add this feature to my blog .
last night i went to a body building competition my friend colin was entered in .
<#> thing i found out is that body building is like any other sporting event .
"<UNK> are encouraged to cheer on their favorites , and many of the <UNK> -- if not all of them -- feed off the crowd 's enthusiasm ."
<#> guy walked off stage shaking his head as though he had not done as well as he expected .
"if there 's a lesson here , it 's definitely not to judge yourself on other 's opinions -- it 's the <UNK> that matter , not the audience ."
"i was people watching before the start of the show , and i commented on the level of <UNK> present ."
"are these people really happy , or are these relationships time - sensitive , being <UNK> to the garbage as the years pass ?"
once the competition started i found myself riding the energy level of the crowd .
i was shocked at the level of support these people had for the <UNK> .
"there was also a strong feeling of accomplishment present , even among the people who did n't win awards ."
all the <UNK> were proud of their work and their trials .
"this , for me , was the most satisfying part : knowing that , win or lose , the people present had achieved the goals they had set ."
"when i talked with my friend colin after the performance , he was glowing with happiness , and i was so very proud of what he accomplished ."
"at <#> , he was competing with many people less than half his age ."
that was definitely the highlight of my evening .
"rather , it 's just as intense a level of training and competition as any other sport , and the people are as friendly and <UNK> as anyone else ."
urllink it 's funny ' cuz it 's true .
why does the world suck like a $ <#> <UNK> ?

-- urllink britney spears coming out about her <UNK>
we bought some mini - donuts at the dragon boat races today .
everyone loves the mini - donuts -- there was a line of at least <#> people at urllink <UNK> on the lake .
what is it about these mini - donuts that people like so much ?
what about a <UNK> - <UNK> the size of a life <UNK> : would it sell as well ?
i wonder if i could make any money selling <UNK> as mini - mini - donuts .
there 's a secret message in every bag : <UNK> .
"<UNK> and i picked up our <UNK> today from urllink globe theatre , for urllink <UNK> on the lake tomorrow ."
"<UNK> and i also won <UNK> , and we got our pictures urllink posted on the globe theatre website !"
i think people are mostly like me in that they 're not very creative <UNK> .
"they do n't come up with good ideas on their own , but have to borrow and <UNK> them from others ."
this is where <UNK> are born : someone creative starts something which other non - creative people find interesting .
"<UNK> die when someone else creative starts something else interesting , and then we all follow along like sheep ."
"if everyone had creative ideas in a consistent manner there would be fewer <UNK> , as people would be too busy pursuing their own ideas ."
"there would still be some <UNK> , however , as some ideas would shine like brilliant lights from a distant <UNK> ."
i was thinking about what i 'm going to do with some of my <UNK> .
"i do have a <UNK> ( storyline , for all those that are n't in the know )"
i can try to run but i 'm not sure how i 'm going to start it off .
besides i need to talk to the other <UNK> about it .
"for my dad a simple "" i love you . "" for my <UNK>"
i could n't have had a better man raising me or loving me .
he 's the stick i measure all men up to .
i married a man much like my father in views and <UNK> .
"i 'm proud of my father , he 's worked hard all his life to provide for our family ."
i ca n't say that my father is proud of me
disappointing my father always hurt me more than when i ended up getting <UNK> for some <UNK> .
my father often told us stories of his younger life .
"how hard it was , how he wanted so much better for us ."
i heard about his grandmother raising him and the love in his voice when he spoke of her .
"he felt it was important to pass down even those stories to us , my brother and i. "" someday you are going to have to remember these ."
"do n't ever forget and do n't ever let me forget .... if the time comes . """
"to jump start this blog , i 've been watching a lot of movies lately -- hoo - ray for unemployment !"
"so it 's time for some brief , mostly <UNK> , reviews ."
"so , going back a few days ... saturday , july <#> urllink <UNK> <UNK> 's japanese horror day ."
"the disk was bad from <UNK> , but i did see about <UNK> the movie ."
everyone in the movie is dumb as a box of <UNK> and just a little bit less ethical .
it 's a <UNK> dawn of the dead rip - off .
hmmm ? and who knew <UNK> could fall in love .
"urllink the eye <UNK> the sixth sense , a lot of these kinds of movies just seem <UNK> ."
"it 's a pretty movie , filmed in all blue like most modern , <UNK> <UNK> can tell the directors have made many , many music videos ."
"the <UNK> blind girl gets a set of eyes , <UNK> girl sees dead people ."
"there 's a decent end to the movie , and the movie was made by the same people who made the japanese version of the ring , <UNK> ."
it 's mostly an exercise of style over substance .
"sunday , july <#> urllink <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> documentary , a great movie to discuss and debate after it 's over ."
i do n't want to say anything about it .
"watch it on <UNK> , then watch the other semi - related doc that started this doc , just a clown . but see it ."
i <UNK> the dvd and bonus disk just to learn more about this fascinating story .
"it 's a story full of <UNK> , <UNK> , family life and a whole host of issues ."
"see it , the film should have won best documentary last year over bowling for <UNK> ."
"urllink the <#> <UNK> , technically a tv series , but the first episode was <#> hours long ."
"i was going to say "" taken meets x - men , "" but the <UNK> link says "" x - files meets x - men ."
"bad writing and bad acting on a great premise , but i 'll watch it to to see what the mystery is ."
"monday , july <#> urllink shattered glass <UNK> story of <UNK> liar and journalist stephen glass at the new republic ."
i just got a free <UNK> of <UNK> and it 's an interesting magazine whose politics are hard to pin down .
i like that stephen is extremely <UNK> and that the details of the magazine are spot - on .
"of course , there 's a <UNK> and we do grind toward a predictable end ."
the acting is great and the commentary is good because they have the actual editor of <UNK> whose played by peter <UNK> filling in the <UNK> .
"it 's a solid movie , not fantastic , but solid ."
"urllink the shape of things <UNK> did n't realize when i <UNK> this <#> that it was a neil <UNK> movie , otherwise i would have watched it earlier ."
"why does the <UNK> guide <UNK> suck so much , made it sound like a teen movie , but i like paul <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"anyway , it 's a cross between in the company of men and friends and neighbors , <#> earlier <UNK> movies ."
the transition from stage play to movie really shows and paul <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> acting in the first half of the movie .
"that said , i did guess the ending about a third into it , and the movie is all about the ending ."
"that 's okay because the ending is still pretty conversation - worthy and , like his other movies , does n't make any <UNK> on the bad people ."
"that 's cool , even if a few of the movie <UNK> did n't work ."
"tuesday , july <#> urllink <UNK> <UNK> go wrong with <UNK> <UNK> ."
made after psycho and shares the same cold fish thief for a female lead .
"usually in <UNK> movies , there 's a moral <UNK> , the bad guys do n't get away with it ."
"the shocking ending is n't much of a shock and years of movies , you see it coming a mile away ."
"plus , i 'm not a fan of <UNK> <UNK> in this movie , how sean found her sexy , i do n't know ."
"however , his sister - in - law was a <UNK> ."
"overall , a bit long , but a nice , mid - shelf entry from <UNK> ."
"i saw another movie on tuesday , but <UNK> if i can remember it ."
"wednesday , july <#> urllink <UNK> men <UNK> cage and <UNK> scott , ca n't go wrong , huh ?"
"well , this blue - o - vision movie ( do they film these things while high on <UNK> ? )"
", the acting 's great , it 's occasionally <UNK> interesting , it 's about con men , there 's a <UNK> relationship ."
"i did n't even guess the ending , but by the ending , i just did n't care that much ."
i 'm actually a bit <UNK> by my <UNK> reaction to the movie .
"on the bright side , i did enjoy the hour - long documentary on the making of the movie included on the dvd , learned a lot ."
urllink <UNK> wild world of <UNK> <UNK> of the most confusing movies <UNK> has ever <UNK> .
i do have a lot of things planned for this blog .
my vacation next week should give me some time to work on it .
my critics are liking my old blog name better : <UNK> day i thought maybe it sounded a bit too urllink <UNK> .
"i think i 'll go for a walk outside now , the <UNK> 's calling my name , i hear it now ."
"ok , here 's a bit of meat : what kind of parent would let their urllink <UNK> - old watch wrestling on tv ? ?"
<#> - year - olds are supposed to still be watching <UNK> like urllink <UNK> street and urllink blue 's clues .
"what impressions do you want to put into their little minds , anyway ?"
i 'm still not getting the best out of my blog .
"i 'm posting about the <UNK> here , but adding interesting comments on others ' urllink blogs ."
helpful hint of the day : do n't forget to check your urllink filter !
"thanks to a few <UNK> over the last couple weeks , i 'm starting to feel like urllink <UNK> in <UNK> episode urllink <#> ."
there is some place else i am supposed to be .
"reading left to right , by row : boys are great ."
"( sorry , i forgot this <#> , but it was n't happy )"
never <UNK> the power of stupid people in large numbers come closer .
"wow , honey , that must have been a really bad break - up ."
and thanks to urllink for the free commenting code !
"<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> i had misunderstood part of the instructions for the comments , but i 've got it all figured out now ."
"unfortunately , i had to delete the <#> comment i did have to correct it ."
"we probably do n't need comments about <UNK> , anyway ."
here 's the graphic i made for the blog : urllink see shell 's
"we love language so much , we have to come up with a new <UNK> for everything ."
"each decade , kind of job , music genre , and game has new words to learn ."
"this <UNK> 's <UNK> her urllink tech , working up a god hand , loaded with plenty of beef , and she 's gonna lock down your deck !"
"oh , the exciting news of the week : my household was picked as a <UNK> family for a week in july ."
tell me on my other blog : urllink other blog
"ca n't do that on live journal , as far as i 've found ."
"that only took me <#> tries and a little help from the urllink <UNK> , but i finally figured out how to put a link in with words ."
i 'm trying to decide which i like better : blogger or live journal .
urllink <UNK> they each have things i like and do n't like .
<UNK> you mean there 's no comment section here ?
"quote for a new blog : "" you do n't have to see the whole <UNK> ; just take the first step . """
here 's a couple cool things to tide us over :
urllink <UNK> urllink small stories urllink <UNK> boy
"a quote from paul : "" speech is conveniently located <UNK> between thought and action , where it often <UNK> for both . """
"do n't forget to wash your urllink "" <UNK> !"
i accidentally saw the last half of urllink she <UNK> the other night .
"hey look that urllink "" <UNK> site from the commercial is really out there ."
"<UNK> ' in as long as i can remember , <#> of my favorite things in the world is sleeping in on saturday morning ."
"my kids are old enough now to get their breakfast , and keep quiet until mama gets up ."
"big brother ok , i 'm hooked on urllink <UNK> ."
"i 'll admit it . but look , i do n't have to spend urllink $ <#> for the on - line all - day feed ."
since urllink other fans who have spent the money will give us the urllink play - by - play !
"latest favorite bumper sticker "" the more i get to know people , the more i love my <UNK> """
more <UNK> ' i finally found time to work on this blog again .
"love those addictive , <UNK> , colorful little puzzle games ?"
"like <UNK> , diamond mine ( or <UNK> toy ) , and q - bees ?"
"here 's my new favorite , not <UNK> , but urllink <UNK> balls ."
in any form that song takes me back to an innocent beautiful place .
"plus , i love hearing familiar songs done in a new style ."
"like <UNK> <UNK> 's "" shine "" that we heard again last night ."
i really love what she brought out in that song .
looks like she 's doing a couple more covers on her urllink new album .
it 's looking at something you 've always seen in a different way .
and you see something you 've never seen before .
thursday bit o ' beauty : urllink katherine <UNK>
"after lunch with the girls , <UNK> saw a great bumper sticker : "" so many cats ."
i still have n't gotten it quite <UNK> i 'd like it .
"it 's still in the learning phase ( like most of my blog ) , so please be patient with me ."
"i think someone tried to chat with me earlier tonight , and i did n't get it figured out before they logged off ."
"i 'm usually on - line during my ' sweet hour ' of the day , the time between when my kids go to bed and when i do ."
( anywhere from 9:00 to 11:00 ) and more on the weekends .
yay i finally got the free image hosting figured out !
"may <#> , <#> i got out into the yard to do some work , finally ."
it 's embarrassing how long i 've let the <UNK> go out there .
it felt so good to dig up some of the weeds and grass and <UNK> that 's <UNK> the bed .
now they are <UNK> within the bed and even the rose bush that tracy and sean bought for us when <UNK> died has survived yet another winter .
it seems <UNK> that <#> years have passed since <UNK> 's death .
"he was our first great <UNK> , and he died at michigan state when they failed to put him on a <UNK> during a <UNK> ."
"his almost - brother , <UNK> , <UNK> him , but he is also a <UNK> dog ."
"<UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> 's , as well , but his case is less severe and <UNK> so far ."
"unfortunately , <UNK> is also <UNK> and has developed <UNK> in both eyes due to the diabetes ."
he is nearly blind and requires <#> units of <UNK> daily to keep him from slipping into a <UNK> .
"<UNK> , our other <UNK> , is <UNK> healthy ."
"however , he 's aggressive and <UNK> and we have to limit his exposure to others ."
our years of dog ownership have been nothing if not <UNK> with <UNK> .
"i love my dogs , but i plan to enjoy a year or <#> of dog freedom after my ' boys ' pass on ."
"i 've been <UNK> with the idea of getting an irish <UNK> after that , given that i understand them to be <UNK> gentle and sweet ."
"if i 'm going to have a dog , give me a great big <#> , thank you ."
but just <#> next time - <#> dogs is too much to handle when i have so many other responsibilities .
tonight i once again heard henry crying after i 'd put him to bed .
"he was , in fact , sleeping <UNK> - i 'd just imagined his cry ."
funny how <UNK> i imagine the slightest <UNK> from him .
"i was told that once i became a mother , i 'd never really sleep <UNK> again , and i have to laugh over how true that is ."
"we 're <UNK> to formula after nearly <#> months of exclusively pumping , and it 's going well ."
"still , i am surprised by a sudden sadness over this passage ."
"we could never get henry to nurse consistently , and i had to work really hard to maintain a milk supply by just using the pump ."
"eventually , it became too difficult and i had to choose to <UNK> him to formula or spend nearly every waking hour pumping ."
"even though i know that he will <UNK> on formula , i feel sorrow and guilt over switching him over ."
"i even tried <#> last - ditch effort to get him to <UNK> on today , and he cried and <UNK> until i gave up ."
"there 's a part of me that wants to <UNK> my efforts to pump for him , but i know it 's really not <UNK> ."
"<UNK> and stubborn and sweet - not too quick to laugh , but oh , when he laughs ."
he loves to be held and danced around the living room .
he holds eye contact with you for so long that you feel like he 's seeing who you really are .
"may <#> , <#> it 's come to my attention that some people we know are considering pursuing gender selection for their next pregnancy via sperm separation ."
"this , of course , has <UNK> a <UNK> of research and philosophical thought on my part ."
"the family in question currently has <#> son , and it was common knowledge that the woman really wanted a daughter ."
"i , too , initially wished for a daughter , so i can understand the desire for the child of a particular gender ."
"so , i do n't want to come off as overly harsh ."
as if having a son must 've been such a disappointment that they were going to make sure that did n't happen again .
"it feels <UNK> and shallow to me , somehow ."
"of course , i did n't know this in the early days of my pregnancy ."
"when the baby 's gender was still unknown to me , i tried to imagine what having a son or a daughter would feel like ."
"in short , i focused on handing down what i knew how to do ."
"once i knew we were expecting a son , however , i realized that as a couple , we were in a perfect position to raise a son ."
"heck , we 're even <UNK> video game players !"
"aside from the risks and expense , i would never want my son to feel less - than for <#> split second ."
"and , make no mistake , the expense is <UNK> and the potential for risk very real ."
"because sperm separation requires artificial <UNK> , the <UNK> of success on the first try is significantly reduced ."
it 's my understanding that the average ai patient requires <#> or <#> tries before they succeed .
"on top of that , the basic methods of separation are anything but <UNK> ."
"<#> method , known as <UNK> - sorting , is based on the fact that female sperm have <#> % more genetic material than male sperm ."
"the sperm are washed in a dye , during which process the female sperm , by virtue of their greater mass , absorb more of the dye ."
a laser then <UNK> the now gender - <UNK> sperm .
the risks of <UNK> the dna with this process are unknown .
another method is potentially less <UNK> but only <UNK> your odds if what you want is a concentrate of male sperm .
"but what 's left behind is not a concentrate of female sperm , but rather a <UNK> mix of female sperm and slow male sperm ."
"with either method , odds are improved but far from guaranteed ."
"a <UNK> venture , if you ask me ."
but the bottom line is that i 'm probably enjoying this philosophical and biological <UNK> for <UNK> .
i sincerely doubt these people will ever have the opportunity to give either of these methods a try .
"at this point , i have to breathe a sigh of relief ."
"may <#> , <#> maybe everything i wrote the other night was bullshit ."
"i do n't mean that i think it was bullshit , but that other people might ."
it only takes an evening news show to demonstrate that a <UNK> of <UNK> people do n't feel as deeply as i do about their babies .
"take , for instance , the fact that my son will never have any doubt that i am his mother and my husband is his father ."
nor will he have any doubt that his parents will always be happily married .
"( again , piss off if you think that 's arrogant or <UNK> ."
"in our case , it is simple truth . ) nor"
will he have any doubt that we will love and cherish him every day of our lives and beyond .
it never really occurred to me that these circumstances alone set him apart from a vast number of children - perhaps even the majority .
"the aforementioned news program <UNK> <#> married couples , each with several children ."
"in each case , the <UNK> of the youngest child was in question because both wives admitted to having had an affair ."
"dna tests were done , and in each case , the husband was not the child 's father ."
"admittedly , this is gut - <UNK> sad for everyone involved : the spouse , the child 's half - siblings , the child himself ."
am i the only <#> so disgusted over this enormous moral failing that will bring season after season of emotional <UNK> as its <UNK> ?
this sort of thing makes me want to bring back the days of public <UNK> .
but i also know that the reason so many people ca n't stand somebody like dr .
"belly up to the bar for your shot of obligation , folks ."
"eugene works with t , a young man who 's just entered his twenties ."
"he and his girlfriend , s , had been dating for about <#> months when they learned she was pregnant ."
"plus , a guy 's gotta have his fun , right ?"
"to this , i say , "" give me a break ! """
"i still believe that <UNK> a child out of <UNK> should <UNK> the big wedding , <UNK> with white gown ."
"i believe that from the moment you become a parent , your ' right ' to an island <UNK> <UNK> ."
"i 'd be checking the "" regrets "" box on that wedding invitation with a fat , permanent marker and a <UNK> stroke ."
"add to this the "" oprah <UNK> show "" this past tuesday - boys and girls as young as <#> and <#> engaged in oral sex ."
have we failed to teach so many children even the most basic lessons of personal dignity ?
"tracy called me during the first commercial break , needing to issue a long and low moan over the <UNK> of what we were seeing ."
"they are utterly blind to the concept of regret , living only in a <UNK> - present ."
i 'd no sooner put my child in a randomly chosen group of children than i would wash an expensive white <UNK> in a load of cheap red clothing .
"thanks all the same , but we plan to limit and hand - select our children 's friends ."
"call it whatever you like , but my kid 's not playing at your house unless i know you and your kid inside and out ."
"so , my baby already enjoys advantages unknown to countless numbers of his peers ."
"and , make no mistake , they are advantages ."
"how sad for those other babies , denied what we should all secure for them before they are even a <UNK> in their daddy 's eye ."
"may <#> , <#> i kept waiting for some magic moment to start this , and just tonight i realized that the lightning <UNK> was never going to arrive ."
"if i kept waiting for it , this period of my life would slip right through my mind and heart as if through some <UNK> <UNK> ."
i 've always needed the tangible record to retain the <UNK> <UNK> of life .
the other thing that held me back from beginning was my need to start with something truly important to say .
"so , let this ( whatever * this * is ) be whatever it will be ."
i ca n't change what i have to say any more than i can change the <UNK> of my person .
"my son , henry , is exactly <#> months old tonight ."
"by this , i mean whole calendar months and not that wacky way new mothers have of <UNK> their child 's age in weeks ."
"this moment of realization had indeed been the <UNK> lightning <UNK> , and it occurred at the moment of his birth ."
it seemed entirely natural to count the hours and minutes since my world had begun to spin on an entirely new <UNK> .
this new <UNK> force is just now beginning to feel all right .
he eats regularly and with <UNK> <UNK> sounds that make my toes curl with enjoyment .
"oh , oh , oh - did you just see him there ?"
i could ignore these no more than i could decide to cease <UNK> .
"so he 's perfect , and i 'm so lucky i could spit ."
"perhaps this only reveals the <UNK> of my <UNK> , but i do n't care ."
"i 'm smart , and compassionate , and honest and kind ."
"we are fred <UNK> and ginger rogers when it comes to our values and our goals , <UNK> along to the same rhythm ."
we have n't had to master the art of compromise simply because we are virtually always in total and perfect harmony .
"piss on you if you do n't like hearing this , but that 's pretty much the way it should be ."
i would n't have considered bringing a child into this world had we not been properly set up for it .
a <UNK> on you who 've handled the sacred with your shitty hands and lousy intentions .
my way of keeping the <UNK> from <UNK> is to keep my regrets handy .
look at the easy way out through the lens of regret and it does n't look so appealing any more .
it hits you like a <UNK> train with a full load .
"in fact , it takes weeks for you to <UNK> all the ways that the <UNK> express has <UNK> you ."
let 's look at a few : you will never look at a child the same way again .
"the <UNK> horror with which you will absorb any report of <UNK> to another child , any child , is enough to set you physically <UNK> ."
"i 've been a true crime <UNK> all my life , and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and crime - solving television shows ."
"within a couple of weeks of henry 's birth , i 'd decided i 'd earned the privilege of having the satellite tv turned on again ."
"i 'd seen <#> too many episodes of "" the <UNK> "" at <#> am with only the local channels to keep me alert while feeding the babe ."
"that first night , i tuned in to <#> of my favorite true crime shows ."
a young mother and her <UNK> - old baby had been reported missing after what appeared to be a <UNK> .
i was a wreck for a solid week <UNK> .
i 'd take <#> look at him and my tears would roll <UNK> down my face all over again .
how could anyone be so cruel to another human being ?
these same desperate feelings come <UNK> to the surface at the mention of anybody 's baby in harm 's way .
"after all , that could be my baby ."
"you set aside a lot of <UNK> , shallow concerns in favor of gigantic , important , life - <UNK> stuff ."
"ok , so maybe this <#> is n't universal ."
"i seem to know a fair number of parents who are n't <UNK> out into the deep , necessarily ."
"but a whole laundry list of stuff that had previously occupied a fair to <UNK> ' amount of my mental energy seems <UNK> ridiculous , now ."
"i am eager to form and demonstrate the very qualities i wish for him , in the hopes that my example will be the best mold . and"
"in order to reach for that , i 've gotta let go of this ."
"the stream of consciousness goes something like this : "" ok so what should we have for dinner tonight gee"
"no fewer than <#> nights , even while i am dead asleep ."
"he knows i am sound asleep , but i still insist he answer my questions ."
"so he <UNK> , and the very <UNK> my <UNK> end , my <UNK> <UNK> ."
the fact that i know the very idea to be absurd when i am awake does nothing to <UNK> the fears in my dreams .
"i can not drive anywhere without thinking "" i did put him in the car , right ?"
"he is here , right ? "" no matter how recently i , myself , <UNK> him in his car seat ."
"maybe this <#> <UNK> with time , but my gut is telling me not to bet on it ."
"of course , there are <UNK> things i could add to this list , but they 're smaller - not so <UNK> , you know ."
"for some people , the <UNK> nature of pregnancy and <UNK> are <UNK> with <UNK> , but i happen to disagree ."
"in this endeavor , i finally found something for which to praise my physical self ."
"my body could hardly be considered the envy of women anywhere , even before the <UNK> of pregnancy ."
"so , naturally , i had slim hopes for an improved self - image ."
"but , amazingly , my assessment of myself <UNK> to life during pregnancy ."
"( a running joke with a close friend was "" broad shoulders ..."
"good breed stock "" , which we <UNK> in a <UNK> , <UNK> german accent , after which we giggled <UNK> . )"
"i was born to do this , and , dammit , i was grateful for that ."
"these days , i am far less consumed by form and far more concerned with function ."
"* me ! <UNK> ' m michelle , <#> - <#> years old as of july <#> ."
"before i say <#> word about myself , please refer to my all - time favorite quote : "" do i <UNK> myself ?"
"now that you 've heard my disclaimer , we can proceed ."
you 'll find little to feel warm and fuzzy about here .
"however , i am utterly <UNK> by anyone who <UNK> blind and <UNK> allegiance to any political party ."
i am a hard - core <UNK> and consider <UNK> and <UNK> among my favorite hobbies .
"i am an animal - lover who has tried many times to go vegetarian , but failed miserably ."
i am a practicing catholic who returned to the poor <UNK> of my childhood and i <UNK> the community i 've found there .
i have an utterly filthy mouth and am trying hard to curb my colorful <UNK> - but you will surely see them <UNK> throughout here .
i am a <UNK> fan of donald roller wilson 's artwork ( <UNK> ) and hope <#> day to be able to afford <#> of his prints .
i love anything from the <UNK> movement from the <UNK> .
our house is a great example of frank <UNK> wright 's <UNK> concept .
it 's amazing - a real <#> - of - a - kind .

"i knit and draw and write , both <UNK> and for pleasure , as hobbies ."
i used to work for <#> of the big <#> <UNK> but left after several years of disgust and <UNK> .
"i took a year off , began to work at my vet clinic for fun and promptly got pregnant ."
it was the only job i have ever truly loved .
"i have degrees in business administration ( the great "" get - a - job - for - sure "" <UNK> degree ) and spanish ."
"if i had it to do over again , i do n't know what i 'd study , but it surely would n't be that ."
"i share my life with : * eugene , my dear husband of <#> years as of june <#> , <#> - <#> years old as of february <#> ."
he is <#> <UNK> human being and i <UNK> to be more like him with each passing year .
"he is patient , kind , honest , compassionate and hard - working ."
"i 've been with him since october of <#> , when he was a freshman in college and i was a sophomore ."
he was so cute that i <UNK> him down like a <UNK> dog and i 've been in love ever since .
he wore a <UNK> the cat watch that his mom had gotten for him by mailing in cat food labels and i knew he was the <#> for me .
"born in december of <#> , he is the light of our lives ."
"at nearly <#> months old at the time of writing , he amazes and <UNK> me every day ."
"he is an incredibly pleasant child , with a great sense of humor and a streak of determination a mile wide ."
"for many years , i thought i would be <UNK> for life - but then i read"

"these are <UNK> <UNK> , let me tell you ."
"<UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> 's syndrome ( a <UNK> <UNK> condition that limits his <UNK> ) , diabetes and bi - <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the diabetes ."
"he was <#> in july of <#> , and this summer will be his last ."
"his health has been <UNK> for some time , and we do n't want to put him through another winter ."
"of late , i cry <UNK> over our impending loss ."
"<UNK> , on the other hand , is <UNK> healthy ."
"he was <#> as of may <#> , and he is fat and <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's diet <UNK> as soon as our <UNK> - dependent <UNK> passes away - we have to keep food available at all times for <UNK> - <UNK> .
"* <UNK> and <UNK> , our <UNK> brother and sister <UNK> team ."
the only cats i 've ever known to come when called to both family and complete strangers .
"<UNK> , in particular , is well - known as a * kitty - whore * to our buddies at the vet clinic for his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> is every bit as sweet , but she has an - ahem <UNK> <UNK> problem . which is to say that every now and then she <UNK> somewhere"
our <UNK> solution is to keep <UNK> largely <UNK> .
"let 's see - what else should you know , going in ?"
"i have some reservations about keeping this journal and deciding with whom to share it , among people i know in ' real ' life ."
i 'm still working this out as i go along .
"so , let 's get started , shall we ?"
"her first baby is due august <#> , <#> , and they wo n't let her go beyond that date because she is an <UNK> - dependent <UNK> <UNK> ."
i have kept her in my prayers that her baby is happy and healthy and that her gd <UNK> like a bad memory after delivery .
"i remember telling her how she 'd miss being pregnant , once her baby was born and she found this difficult to believe , early on ."
"but she told me recently that she now understood what i meant , and that she was downright <UNK> over the approaching end of her pregnancy ."
i saw on the news today that <#> teenage girls who 'd been <UNK> in california this morning were recovered safely and their <UNK> was shot and killed .
i told tracy that a person could n't ask for a happier ending .
i took her friendly <UNK> commentary as a compliment ( as she knew i would ) and said again what a delight the whole outcome was .
<#> fewer <UNK> to <UNK> the courts and <UNK> prison workers .
i hope they 're making up a bed of nails for him in hell .
"surely she 's dead by now , but my god - how must her family be getting through the days ?"
"i feel most for her little sister , and i wonder what kind of therapy the upcoming years hold for that poor child ."
"i would happily volunteer to <UNK> the <UNK> with a dull butter knife , given the opportunity ."
i simply do not believe that it is fair to ask anyone to interact with especially dangerous criminals who are really just wild animals .
i believe that an individual <UNK> their ' right ' to draw breath when they commit a violent act against an innocent victim .
"another thing on my mind has been the <UNK> <UNK> series "" <UNK> house "" ."
"i 've seen it twice now , and i get something new out of it each time ."
the latest personal revelation for me has been my change of heart regarding karen <UNK> .
"the <UNK> barely register above the * <UNK> * tick for me , in the end ."
"i could see why karen could n't stand them , quite frankly ."
i wanted to reach into the tv and tell her to shake it off - the feeling of being less - than in the face of <UNK> <UNK> .
yet i understood how karen feels <UNK> in the face of what society calls <UNK> .
"women are supposed to be soft - spoken and sweet and <UNK> , and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> notion of what makes a woman <UNK> ."
"women are n't supposed to be <UNK> , or moody , or difficult , or <UNK> ."
"i wanted to shake her husband mark and tell him to be a man , already - give his wife the loving support she so desperately needed ."
"wrap your arms around that <UNK> , you idiot ! underneath"
that <UNK> <UNK> beats the <UNK> heart of gold .
"that 's what marriage is about , for crying out loud !"
"but everybody 's so quick to assume the "" <UNK> ! """
<UNK> - which does nothing to <UNK> the situation .
"karen probably felt like she was talking to the wall , with nobody to really hear her ."
"i 'm sure she 's probably received the <UNK> of critical comments about the show , and that <UNK> me ."
"in her <UNK> place , i 'm happy to <UNK> : gordon <UNK> - what a <UNK> ."
"sorry , <UNK> - that 's not the "" <UNK> spirit "" - that 's just fraud ."
"you may be considered a success in the modern age , <UNK> , but you 're dead out there on the <UNK> . and"
"karen <UNK> was the <UNK> on that piece of meat , and that 's that ."
"give me a strong , <UNK> , ' plain ' woman any day over any of those others ."
"i still have some chores tonight - miles to go before i sleep , so to speak ."
"august <#> , <#> jerry <UNK> has written a <UNK> book about halloween <UNK> and the oh - so - <UNK> title ?"
"before you <UNK> <UNK> in my direction , i actually read the book the whole way through tonight ."
"i gave the matter the appropriate respect and benefit of the doubt , so <UNK> up now ."
"<UNK> <UNK> written like a stand - up routine for adults , <UNK> <UNK> about halloween from a <UNK> perspective ."
<UNK> a <UNK> book written by someone who has no idea how to write for children .
the only thing that <UNK> was cutting was a giant <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> .
"but , hey <UNK> jerry <UNK> a celebrity ! a big star !"
"of course , <UNK> want a book by a big star for our <UNK> !"
<UNK> full of nifty <UNK> <UNK> of a wee <UNK> and it even has a cd of the big star reading his very own text !
"when are we , as a collective society , going to shake off this <UNK> stupid idol - worship ?"
give it some thought and try to tell me <UNK> wrong .
what a waste of time and energy and emotion and money .
"go learn to bake bread , <UNK> a <UNK> , grow tomatoes , fix a <UNK> ."
"anything <UNK> just do something other than watch access hollywood while you thumb through in style , ok ?"
"i have plenty to be happy about , anyway ."
"they were on sale at target , so i bought a bunch of them , figuring <UNK> fill them up eventually ."
"i bought a different color than the ones i have now , so that <UNK> know just by looking at them that they contain <UNK> clothing ."
"i know <UNK> going to get me all <UNK> and misty - eyed , packing away the stuff h has already <UNK> ."
wondering if <UNK> get another little boy to wear some of this stuff again .
"tomorrow the <UNK> and yard cleaning continues , plus some <UNK> ."
"now that i refuse to iron anything , <UNK> has taken the top spot on my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> list ."
i <UNK> buy or wear anything that requires <UNK> .
"besides , i have not only <UNK> my inner <UNK> , i have her in a death grip , which <UNK> wearing anything with a crisp line . )"
"i promised myself i would <UNK> <#> things , and be done with it ."
then i can walk away feeling like queen of all i survey .
have i told <UNK> how cute our priest is ?
"but <UNK> just the sweetest thing , and <UNK> no wonder everybody <UNK> him ."
"<UNK> the kind of priest where you get bummed just thinking about him ever leaving , because you know his poor replacement would pale in comparison ."
"the council meetings will be fun and informative , to be sure ."
"sister m. , our resident nun , is in attendance , too , and her presence alone makes me hum like a <UNK> lap cat ."
<#> minutes with that woman and you know <UNK> not a mean bone in her body <UNK> goodness is just <UNK> off her in waves .
"so , <UNK> another thing on my to do list , but <UNK> also a good place to be . and"
"<UNK> a great excuse to bake things i <UNK> have hanging around the house <UNK> yet another reason to look forward to doing my catholic duty , heh heh ."
another thing to be happy about is super mario sunshine for the nintendo gamecube .
"<UNK> been waiting for this game since last november , and now <UNK> finally here !"
and i have been playing like <UNK> both <#> - year - old boys with nothing better to do .
<UNK> soaked up enough time with the game already so that the theme music is <UNK> in my brain .
i remember <UNK> being pregnant and wondering when <UNK> actually release this game
". now <UNK> got it , and <UNK> going to love every minute of it ."
"crawling is old news by now , and his <#> bottom teeth are all the way out ."
"<UNK> both independent and a <UNK> , and he makes me all <UNK> inside , even still ."
"august <#> , <#> well , i saw <#> movies this weekend , and the desire to contrast <#> of them is just overwhelming ."
i watched <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> sweetest <UNK> on friday .
"i wanted a flick fix , so i figured <UNK> get a girly movie to watch in the afternoon before <UNK> got home ."
"<UNK> get <UNK> the <UNK> out of the way right now . a quiet , desperate little film ."
"recommended , but <UNK> a <UNK> , so consider yourself <UNK> ."
"now , <UNK> talk for a bit about <UNK> sweetest <UNK> , shall we ?"
"i admit that when i rented it , i was not expecting fine <UNK> ."
"my standards were , i thought , more than reasonable ."
i wanted a cute movie with a few laughs .
"i required no <UNK> <UNK> , nor <UNK> dialogue ."
"just the <UNK> equivalent of cotton candy , ok ?"
"what i got was surprisingly <UNK> and <UNK> , and <UNK> been looking forward to breaking down my incredibly negative reaction in writing ."
"mostly for my own benefit , if you must know ."
<UNK> see <UNK> where to start ? maybe with the writer of this piece of shit
"<UNK> <UNK> a real <UNK> , <UNK> tell ya ."
"<#> of those <UNK> gore , cooler - than - thou types ."
"the dvd had bonus materials that included the most self - <UNK> interview of this <UNK> of a woman that i have ever seen , bar none ."
how did she find so many people to jack her off with a smile on their faces ?
"gee , sister , if <UNK> all the same to you , <UNK> speak for myself <UNK> <UNK> nowhere near to telling my truth ."
"so , ok , we have an annoying author who thinks <UNK> written <UNK> <UNK> what about the movie , michelle ?"
"like all super - cool chicks just dance for no reason , right ?"
"in <UNK> , ankle - <UNK> high heels and tight pants ."
while talking on their cell phones with their bestest girlfriends .
"so <UNK> the arrogance , and i <UNK> at the whole whore thing ."
"every female character in this movie <UNK> like room temperature whipped butter , but <UNK> that just fun ?"
"girls need to <UNK> those wild <UNK> , too , ya know !"
these characters are <UNK> beyond the age where this seems like remotely a good idea .
"a grown woman , graduated from college and living on her own , <UNK> been able to pull her head from her <UNK> - <UNK> ass by now ."
"the <UNK> , easy sexuality is <UNK> and off - putting . and"
definitely not funny <UNK> pathetic is more the word .
"young people today are increasingly stupid , and <UNK> afraid young girls are perhaps the most vulnerable in this way ."
<UNK> wonder what they could have been if <UNK> spent more time in their thoughts and less time in the mall .
so i hated the movie because it <UNK> everything i find so dangerous and tedious and useless about women in modern society .
"todd <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> guy who <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> and <UNK> , has put together another exercise in emotional torture ."
"<UNK> the thing about his movies <UNK> he manages to be both cartoon - y and <UNK> genuine and painfully <UNK> , all at the same time ."
"<UNK> a brief movie , with the option to watch either the r - rated version or the <UNK> version , which delighted me thoroughly ."
"( <UNK> been wanting to see <UNK> for a <UNK> , but blockbuster only rents the edited version ."
"give it all to me <UNK> <UNK> a grown - up and i can take it , gosh <UNK> it . )"
"anyway , i <UNK> want to say too much about <UNK> except that perhaps if the <UNK> collection releases it , <UNK> buy it ."
i hope i have the kind of children who grow to be young adults capable of seeing a film like this and having it inspire intelligent discussion .
"<UNK> <#> of those movies that covers so much territory , and it does so with <UNK> , small touches ."
"the <UNK> response is heard but not seen before the quick cut : <UNK> , <UNK> mmmm ."
i <UNK> want to fuck this up with my attempt to talk about it .
<UNK> too grand for me to do anything but <UNK> it .
very nice stuff from what is obviously a <UNK> man .
"<UNK> <UNK> , and i liked that , too ."
"still , nothing can touch <UNK> for genuine , tortured greatness ."
"august <#> , <#> sorry <UNK> taken me so long to update the site ."
"my sleeping habits have been lousy at best , and every day <UNK> operating at a lower and lower <UNK> ."
you can just tell he thinks <UNK> so cool when he does this .
"he may as well be <UNK> to me , <UNK> so attached ."
"he is simply <UNK> determined to get what he wants , when he wants it ."
"and what he wants these days is me , <#> ."
"so , <UNK> cage was on <UNK> and kelly this morning ."
i saw a few minutes before i had to turn off the tv for <UNK> <UNK> .
"i mean , is it not <UNK> obvious that this <#> - note actor only wants his shot at <UNK> the <UNK> of the king ?"
how many movies has cage done with his not - so - subtle elvis <UNK> ?
( not the easiest thing to do when <UNK> as bald as a <UNK> ball ! )
"he even did his best elvis singing voice in <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> , shake it off ."
<UNK> not right to put your twisted fantasies onto the narrow shoulders of a small child .
"speaking of <UNK> celebrities , i wish i could go <#> months without seeing <UNK> wilson on tv , <UNK> about how <UNK> still not fat again !"
how freaking gross to have <UNK> make you a thumb - sized stomach as a last - ditch effort to keep you from killing yourself with food .
"besides , <UNK> never forget about hearing that <UNK> <UNK> surgery makes you smell very , very bad for a long time ."
<UNK> noticed a few more commercials that drive me <UNK> lately .
the first <#> is an old <UNK> pet <UNK> : bad grammar .
"fucking a , <UNK> not even trying any longer !"
"how does this shit get approved , is what i want to know ."
the other thing that bugs me about commercials lately is the way they lie through their <UNK> teeth .
"the <UNK> commercial for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with ridiculously computer animated <UNK> , for example ."
no way in hell <UNK> buying that product for this <UNK> commercial sin .
i <UNK> care that they have a little disclaimer at the bottom <UNK> <UNK> still <UNK> and stupid of them .
"say your prayers , people <UNK> <UNK> might be just around the corner ."
"you might just as well be a whore as be an advertising agency worker , from a moral <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <#> of <#> , half dozen of another ."
the other is the <UNK> toilet bowl cleaner with something called <UNK> - <UNK> commercial .
<UNK> the <#> where this goofy music is playing and
"the little girl tries to go into the bathroom , but <UNK> just <UNK> it up ."
"mom puts <#> of these <UNK> in the toilet , and fresh air and easy <UNK> are once again restored ."
"something about it makes me crack up , every time ."
"august <#> , <#> can anyone explain to me why some people <UNK> <UNK> ?"
"that has to be the <UNK> thing , bar none ."
all of you non - <UNK> and part - time <UNK> need to pick up some good quality dental tape and go at it .
"i mean , why not just quit <UNK> your ass ?"
just do your toilet business and pull <UNK> up !
<UNK> should be done at least once a day . and
"if <UNK> not <UNK> , <UNK> a safe bet that your <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> ground , so make <UNK> it part of your routine , too ."
<UNK> just going to tell you what a freaking <UNK> you are if you <UNK> picked those <UNK> of last <UNK> chicken dinner out of your <UNK> yet .
another thing <UNK> bugging me lately are all those oh - so - pc <UNK> with the <UNK>
"if anything makes me want to bust out into <UNK> <UNK> of ethnic <UNK> out of sheer <UNK> , <UNK> shit like this ."
"the same reaction i get when i see those <UNK> commercials with all the clever teens performing their open - your - eyes , anti - smoking <UNK> ."
all i want is a <UNK> of high - <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nails after <#> of those fucking spots .
the world is more interesting with slightly <UNK> old men who grab the asses of diner <UNK> .
"go ahead and make that blonde joke , you <UNK> !"
"just be ready for me to do some <UNK> out , too ."
"for example , i hold women to a higher standard because i am a woman ."
nothing <UNK> me more effectively than to see some dumb broad with nothing more to offer the world than a peek at her fake tits .
"i went looking for an old work incident that i was certain <UNK> written about , but i was unable to find anything on the subject ."
picture <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> - sized <UNK> in a bright yellow <UNK> bikini .
"i would happily <UNK> that woman myself , for <UNK> the standards of expectation for all women everywhere in such a <UNK> fashion ."
and <UNK> give me any bullshit about how her actions <UNK> affect me .
i did and do pay the price for little miss side <UNK> cheese sticks .
"anyway , i wish i <UNK> found my original writing ."
but my little trip down memory lane did <UNK> some laughs .
"i have a few files left of old work - related rants , and some of them are priceless ."
"well , at least to me they are ."
<UNK> see if you agree : * this <UNK> kind of long .
some names have been vaguely changed to protect even those who <UNK> deserve it .
"<UNK> can hear steve over the wall right now , <UNK> to some poor bastard about his <UNK> ."
"apparently , little stephanie or <UNK> or <UNK> or however they spell the child 's name is , in fact , a genius !"
"i know , you probably thought your kids were smart - but she 's far more advanced - trust him on this <#> ."
"ok , <UNK> i ' m <UNK> a bit on this <#> , but i swear that 's exactly how he comes off ."
"if only buzz were here so they could get into a "" whose - dick - is - bigger "" contest over it ."
"his bullshit factory is on a <#> - <#> hour shift , and he 's been this way for so long that he actually believes the lies he tells ."
"unfortunately , behavior like this is not unusual in humans - most of us know at least <#> person who <UNK> in such self - <UNK> ."
what makes buzz a rare and exotic <UNK> is the <UNK> of his <UNK> - he really goes all out ! according to him
"in reality , he 's a <UNK> - divorced loser whose several children will probably spend decades in therapy <UNK> their <UNK> issues with sharing his <UNK> ."
"the gold mine is in his choice of detail , as they reveal more about him than he could know ."
"for example , the celebrities with whom he <UNK> - <UNK> are not the brad pitt variety ."
"no , he hangs with the ted <UNK> of the world - and , suddenly , his low - class core is open for the entire world to see ."
"your heart could break for how pathetic his fantasy world is , if he were n't so <UNK> irritating ."
"the subject of people who , by all rights , deserve your sympathy and compassion but lose it by virtue of some other character flaw is rather <UNK> ."
it was just yesterday when i <UNK> escaped a <UNK> <UNK> who tried to run me over on her motor scooter smack <UNK> in the middle of the office .
""" michelle ! such horrible talk i simply can not <UNK> !"
i highly doubt a poor <UNK> person was seeking to mow you down in front of witnesses !
"your imagination is running away with you ! "" nevertheless , the truth remains ."
"<UNK> is apparently without the use of her legs , which <UNK> the scooter ."
"she 's of <UNK> age , somewhere between <#> - <#> and <#> , and she wears these <UNK> glasses that further obscure her expression ."
"on <#> level , she seems incredibly bitter about her <UNK> ."
"she is , for instance , incapable of <UNK> <#> sentences without drawing your attention directly to the fact that you can walk and she ca n't ."
but then there 's this other element of <UNK> <UNK> over her <UNK> .
she likes watching your discomfort when she twists every conversation around to the subject of her <UNK> .
"it 's her way of making you foot the bill for her rotten luck , i think ."
"of course , her other <UNK> is that fucking scooter ."
"she 's always <UNK> ass down the hallway , <UNK> out of doors wearing the slightest hint of a <UNK> ."
"i 'd like to nickname her "" wheels "" and call it loudly and <UNK> across the building ."
"everyone makes the same face the instant she comes up in conversation - the "" that bitch ! """
"she came <UNK> into the office the other day , looking for the plant manager ."
she <UNK> <UNK> herself into the door and sighed dramatically upon finding the office empty .
this was utterly <UNK> - how could company resources be used for personal property ?
this broad wanted the plant manager 's blessing to do the job right on the floor !
"<UNK> made repeated attempts to stem the flow of her <UNK> by asking , simply , "" do you want to speak to the plant manager ? """
she <UNK> - <UNK> these efforts - she was going to make us pay the standard bill !
"we were n't going to get away without a healthy <UNK> of discomfort , or , by god , her name was n't <UNK> <UNK> !"
"( she should call that fucking thing "" christine "" , if you ask me . )"
"i took a few steps back to be polite , thinking she wanted a better angle to speak to <UNK> ."
she took back about half of the distance she 'd advanced .
i made no effort to disguise my <UNK> as i <UNK> yet again .
"it is then that she <UNK> and <UNK> "" i 'm not going to hit you ."
you keep backing up like i 'm going to hit you .
"i could breathe <UNK> * this is <#> that i made a <UNK> of , because <UNK> actually a couple of phone messages ."
so i could hear just how <UNK> i sounded .
"i had to record them , and i think they come off pretty clear , even in boring old print ."
"( laughter ) maybe you wo n't , maybe you 'll remember it , but i just want you to hear it , ok ?"
"i - i 'm telling you , i could feel my humanity <UNK> away as i sat there ."
"i do n't know who 's in your group , but let me tell you , prepare yourself to have a <UNK> of shit <UNK> down your throat ."
i ca n't even believe <UNK> brain is still functioning .
"i swear to god , i 'm so fucking bitter i ca n't even stand it ."
fucking <UNK> - they might as well hire the <UNK> to conduct this fuckin ' review .
message # <#> <UNK> says : hi - here you go again - you have to hear <UNK> are like <UNK> moments - ( laughter ) .
"<UNK> had <UNK> upon himself "" ( laughter ) ."
"oh , god ! that baby 's lookin ' better and better <UNK> ?"
i got home at shortly after <#> to find that <UNK> had <UNK> upon himself and was covered in it and so was the room .
"all <UNK> have a wonderful weekend i hope i do , too <UNK>"
"ok , last <#> and then <UNK> close this monster blog post ."
"<UNK> 's the second to last work day of the year , and this place is half asleep ."
"it seemed a harmless encounter , but if body language were a wrestling match , the union just scored big time ."
adding insult to the injury of my boredom are the <UNK> sounds of <UNK> <UNK> from over the <UNK> .
"apparently , she 's everything she is because someone loved her ."
i find myself wishing that the person in question could be held <UNK> responsible .
here we go again - people wandering in because they want something .
it 's a testament to the strength of my <UNK> that each and every <#> of them <UNK> before they approach me .
"i do n't know who first said "" there are no dumb questions "" , but they were wrong ."
there are as many dumb questions as there are dumb people to ask them .
"i have great <UNK> vision , so i never have to look up from what i 'm doing to see them clearly ."
"not once has anyone thought about it , then turned away ."
"( perhaps it 's not such a testament to my <UNK> , after all ? )"
their mental equation must go something like : woman + typing = secretary .
can i tell them how to get to room so - and - so ?
is the meeting in this conference room or that ?
"the sooner they 're out of the room , the better ."
"but since <UNK> 's been on vacation , i absolutely refuse to answer any questions on <UNK> 's behalf , even the ones to which i know the answer ."
"it was clear that she had missed the insulting nature of this comment entirely , and she was telling us in that voice"
"it was a <#> - faced approach , remarkable in its <UNK> and the tragic <UNK> with which she acted out the drama of it all ."
i always thought the <UNK> was <UNK> of the clothes she <UNK> on .
they were all painfully tight - i could n't even imagine how she found the strength to get dressed every day .
"i could barely bring myself to put on anything with a <UNK> waist , and here she was - <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> down !"
"her skirts stopped <#> inches or less from every man 's land , and they were generally <UNK> with a wide , <UNK> belt ."
"these <UNK> still <UNK> at the neck , <UNK> a kind of dog collar impression that <UNK> of <UNK> ."
her thin hair was teased into a spider - web <UNK> .
every atom of her seemed to want to <UNK> in discomfort .
she represents everything that drives me crazy about men and women .
the fact that she 's a nice person at heart only makes it <UNK> <UNK> all for now .
"lord knows <UNK> been waiting to get it out for years , now . committing it to paper was not enough to <UNK> those wounds ."
"anyhoo , be safe and practice excellent <UNK> , kids ."
"as i was leaving , i realized that i <UNK> eaten all day and i was <UNK> hungry <UNK> as in , road rage hungry ."
"so , of course , i pulled into the fast food drive - through and ordered some junk food ."
"as i waited for my turn to pay , i saw a man approximately my father 's age come out of the rear door carrying garbage to the bin ."
"he was an employee there , in full fast - food uniform and there was something about him that made my whole heart go out to him ."
i just <UNK> the wheel and asked god to bless him in some big way .
"for example , i <UNK> bear to see very old people eating a meal by themselves ."
"it could be <UNK> himself for all i know , and the reason <UNK> alone is strictly by choice <UNK> but that makes no difference ."
"in my heart , <UNK> eating alone because his beloved wife has died and the kids all moved far away ."
bill <UNK> is the worst for this <UNK> <UNK> always some <UNK> cute golden - <UNK> eating their little bowl of potato salad all by their lonesome .
another thing that always gets me is to see an <UNK> person doing physical activity .
"there was a woman in our old neighborhood that was <#> pounds if she weighed an ounce , and she used to get outside and do some <UNK> ."
"it was a crazy yard , but she put a lot of effort into it and it clearly pleased her ."
"she lived alone , but she seemed a <UNK> woman with many friends ."
"i <UNK> know her , but if i remember correctly , she was a <UNK> of some sort ."
<UNK> funny how you can be proud of someone you <UNK> even know .
"<UNK> lent her some of my <UNK> <UNK> issues ( including the current issue , which is where she got the recipe <UNK>"
"run , do not walk ! ) , and she made what i believe is called <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> lord have mercy ."
"chicken <UNK> , and this was the <UNK> stuff i ever ate ."
i <UNK> left a little <UNK> <UNK> on that plate .
today i made it over to the yarn shop and managed to escape for under $ <#> <UNK> but just barely .
"wild <UNK> yarn is simply so <UNK> , and the good stuff is <UNK> ."
"i have so much waiting to be knit that the last thing i need is more yarn , but that still <UNK> stop me !"
"i only bought enough to make a hat , though ."
"when we came back henry was totally wiped out and ready for a nap , and i went flipping through all of my <#> channels ."
"<UNK> have to have a total <UNK> before <UNK> stand up and cheer like a moron at the wave of some <UNK> , just for the cameras ."
"compared to the average modern human , <UNK> say even the lowest <UNK> are far superior in intelligence ."
"august <#> , <#> i was driving through royal oak today ."
"i actually saw <#> of these losers , and they were all driving <UNK> or <UNK> - <UNK> i was embarrassed for them ."
"but i finally went into a shop <UNK> be interested in for some time , and it turned out to be temptation central ."
"the store is <UNK> on washington street in royal oak , for those of you in the know ."
i went in because i knew they had these incredible picture frames and mirrors in <UNK> - fun <UNK> for <UNK> room .
so i went home and logged on and found their web site ( urllink <UNK> ) .
"they <UNK> sell much on the <UNK> directly , but i called to ask for their <UNK> ."
<UNK> thinking <UNK> get at least <#> little frame .
shine also had these out - of - this - world cute baby <UNK> in the funniest <UNK> <UNK> you ever saw from a company called <UNK>
( <UNK> it amazing what you can scope on the <UNK> ?
"i had no idea who made <UNK> when i started looking , and within <#> minutes i had my answer ! )"
"unfortunately , <UNK> has a <UNK> way to go on their web site <UNK> no ordering <UNK> as yet ."
<UNK> ( our <UNK> ) makes it so easy <UNK> <UNK> super - efficient and always spot - on .
we never have to worry when <UNK> at the <UNK> .
<UNK> hoping that we just <UNK> have enough to re - do the roof over the house .
the other thing <UNK> been on my mind is a treadmill .
"i am so close to buying <#> , but i am trying to hold back ."
"<UNK> <#> of those tricky <UNK> <UNK> you <UNK> necessarily do yourself any <UNK> by buying what seems like a deal , price - wise ."
"i wish i had the scratch for a <UNK> or a true , but even a keys seems out of my league ."
i am nearly about to settle for a marked - down floor model <UNK> . unless i can triumph over this insane desire to exercise .
"i feel like <UNK> is breathing its hot , stinky breath down the back of my neck , and it nearly has me in a <UNK> grip ."
"this may be my last chance to escape , is what <UNK> thinking ."
another stupid thing : we are so excited about the impending release of super mario sunshine for the game cube here at <UNK> michelle .
"<UNK> supposed to come out at the end of this month , sometime <UNK> release dates are <UNK> ."
"<UNK> call you back when <UNK> come down a bit from the video game high , ok ?"
"august <#> , <#> i just have to <UNK> and moan for a minute ."
why ca n't people stay away from using words they do n't understand or know how to pronounce ?
"it is not pronounced "" wah - la "" , for crying out loud ! it 's "" <UNK> - la "" !"
"thank you . and "" <UNK> "" , when used to refer to a person 's strength or <UNK> , is not pronounced "" for - <UNK> "" ."
and it is never spelled with an accent .
"tattoo it on your palm , if need be ."
"of course , it was all said in a half - joking tone , but it was clear that she was anything but kidding around ."
i saw her last week and she <UNK> me about anything and everything .
"she does all of this in front of a large group of friends , too ."
"i had the presence of mind to remind her that the last time we got together , she was <#> minutes late and i still bought her lunch !"
then she hears that <UNK> knitting something for a friend 's baby and she <UNK> that i never made a pair of baby socks for her kid .
"fuckin ' a. anyway , i 'm incredibly busy these days ."
"i would love to <UNK> all the bullshit holiday gift - giving - and expensive greeting cards , for that matter ."
i probably spend $ <#> a year in cards .
"and our house needs everything - new roof , new windows , new fence , new wall <UNK> , new carpet - and maybe even furniture , someday !"
that 's not even considering the fact that we may need to add on to this house if we have another child .
"and , yes , i bought a <UNK> ticket for tonight 's drawing ."
"i 've been thinking of ways to earn some money without <UNK> henry 's care , but i 'm at a loss ."
"i 've been doing some writing for the vet clinic , but that 's in exchange for vet services - which we certainly need , what with our <UNK> ."
"if you have any ideas that do n't involve illegal activity , let me know ."
"and , by the way , that awful <UNK> woman did win the primary ."
i wonder how many <UNK> campaign signs i can fit on my lawn ?
"august <#> , <#> so , jennifer <UNK> is running for governor in our home state of michigan ."
"that woman will take credit for anything and everything , most for which she deserves none whatsoever ."
"but she 's well - <UNK> and <UNK> , and she looks so * <UNK> * in those black and white tv ads !"
"you just know every numb - nuts , know - nothing young female in the whole <UNK> state is going to want to vote for her ."
i can only hope these same idiots do n't bother to get off their gen - x asses to vote in the primary tomorrow .
"should david <UNK> get the democratic nod , i will have concrete evidence that there is a god . on the other hand"
", this would put me in a real <UNK> with regard to casting my vote in november ."
too bad he did n't learn more in those years of <UNK> 's finishing school .
"but , i am anti - abortion and all the democratic <UNK> about a woman 's right to choose makes me want to <UNK> ."
i 'll have to see where this race goes as the months pass .
"kim had her baby yesterday , too . finally !"
poor thing spent <#> days on <UNK> before they finally tried a <UNK> gel to get things moving .
"tracy <UNK> wondered if i was going to pass out , but i swear it was the most fascinating thing i 've ever seen ."
"she was the <UNK> of grace under pressure , and i admired her more than i 've ever admired anyone ."
"she and dennis will be <UNK> excellent parents , and i 'm so excited that henry has a new best buddy ."
"i 've got to get back in the exercise habit , <UNK> de suite ."
i want to get back some muscle tone before i get pregnant again and lose any shot at <UNK> stomach muscles forever .
my main concern these days is generally what to cook for dinner .
the challenge for me is to learn to cook things that do n't require a full stick of butter in everything .
i like my recipes beyond ' down home ' .
"i did , however , make a couple of <UNK> ' peach <UNK> this week ."
god bless the good folks at cook 's <UNK> magazine .
they really know how to lay it out .
"speaking of magazines , i 'm worried that <#> of my favorites has gone the way of the <UNK> ."
"it 's <UNK> magazine , which is devoted entirely to all things modern ."
i will shed <UNK> tears if it 's a thing of the past .
where will i find all those <UNK> images of things over which to lust and drool ?
how will i scheme to spend the <UNK> from the lottery i 'll win someday without a visual aid ?
"i 'll keep my fingers crossed , but it 's not looking good ."
i 've been up way too late as it is .
"henry is a <UNK> <UNK> , and i 'd better get at least <#> hours of sleep if i am to meet his <UNK> demands for attention and <UNK> ."
dave is resting on the couch and watching some boring western !
that 's ok because it gives me some time on line .
"i still kind of wonder that , but i think i 'm hooked ."
"i suppose if people do n't know me and they happen upon my blog , they will most likely be bored !"
maybe even people i know will be bored !
"yesterday after a day spent on the lake , we enjoyed a <UNK> and brat cook - out and lots of laughs around the <UNK> ."
we got home a little late and i was too tired to even check my email .
"i did laundry , but since i have to turn off the ac to run the <UNK> i spread it out all day ."
that way the air was never off for more than <#> mins at a time .
dave put the <UNK> in the <UNK> and did some other work on it .
the ' ole care is looking pretty good .
it has been a quiet day and <UNK> .
i think that 's what sundays are for .
"i tried to find <UNK> and dar 's place this morning , but to no avail ."
"oh well , i came home and cut some more grass ."
i 'm not doing the back yard until later in the week .
it gets soo much sun that even though we 've recently had rain the back yard is already sort of dried up .
"dave 's back and we are going out on <UNK> lake later , ( in about an hour to be exact ! )"
it 's so hard to do stuff outdoors in this heat !
i mean <UNK> lawn on a riding <UNK> is not hard work at all .
"i 'm not <UNK> it , so it is super easy , but ! !"
i 'm <UNK> ' like a pig out there !
"yes , i use sun screen , do n't want any skin cancer creeping up on me ."
"i thought i 'd check mail and update my blog site , but i 'm headed for the shower !"
"i agree , it is nice with the air on on days like today !"
"i like the fresh air too , but on a day like today it is nice to come in and cool off !"
"i managed to change my name but the "" $ "" shows up ."
when i take the dollar sign out i loose my name !
", it 's better than having my full name on ."
"today i cut some grass , but not much ."
i just did the side of the yard where the horse shoe <UNK> are .
i packed the <UNK> because dave is over at <UNK> and dar 's property .
<UNK> and dar recently bought some property near our house .
they are planning on putting a mobile home on the land sometime in the near future .
the people we <UNK> with and play cards with all went up this evening to help <UNK> with something .
"i 'm not sure what , anyway , i stayed back to attend <UNK> 's home and garden party ."
"we had a good time and her cake was absolutely delicious , and low cal ."
"i 'm not sure if i 'll have an interesting enough life to update this daily , but i 'll try ."
"also , if we are gone for the weekend i 'll miss some dates ."
"well , that 's about all for now ."
i need to play with this some more so i can get some links added to my page .
"i need to figure that all out , so i 'm signing out for now !"
"ok , i tried to start this last night ."
"i seem to be able to find my stuff , but not what i did first thing this afternoon , or what i did last night !"
i guess that 's what i 'm doing .
"mom , nat , and <UNK> convinced me this is something i should do ."
i 'm going to make a funny <#> under the name of my beloved !
"we do n't have pets , so i ca n't do that point of view !"
"well , once again , i do n't know if this is working or not , we shall see !"
"as you may have already read in nat 's blog , there is hope for our school !"
"the finance committee sounded like they really wanted to close the school down , but there were many members of the <UNK> who are really fighting for us ."
"if the appropriate changes are made , and the school runs for another year , i will stay ."
i am sure that if she is not let go the school will not open anyway .
"i spoke out at this meeting , and i threw <UNK> to the wind where <UNK> was concerned ."
<#> of the teachers on our staff thanked me for speaking what was also on their minds .
"many parents , past and present , came up to me after the meeting to talk to me ."
i am convinced the people of the community now see me as a respected teacher of the school .
on another note : i finished the <UNK> for <UNK> .
"the good news is , melissa is pregnant again ."
she said this would be her last child .
she is not going to find out before the birth the gender of the child .
"that is fine with me , as i know someone who was <UNK> !"
"anyway , we are very happy for melissa and jeremy ."
nick has been spending weekends here working on his car .
"he must like to do body work , because the is the 2nd car he is fixing up !"
"well , it keeps him out of trouble , and he is being very respectful to me ."
"<#> union square west , nyc admission is free there will be a reception following the reading"
"this is where i inform the web , which is the world , about where i 've been published recently and my writing projects ."
"i also include dates and addresses where i 'll be reading , which is usually in nyc ."
"finished the interview with the fabulous drama queens , the all - female drag queen <UNK> of <#> lovely and extremely interesting ladies ."
they really enjoy fucking with people 's ideas about gender ; since they are often mistaken for male drag queens .
i hope everyone will read the article once it comes out !
"it was really hurting , but now it 's just numb and an awful lot of odd colors ."
i ca n't afford to get <UNK> now .
"daddy he is everywhere , <UNK> , the <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> during the crash , <UNK> me , <UNK> my neck in the <UNK> of rescue ."
and i 'm working on a poem that might be okay .
i had a good date yesterday . which i 'm <UNK> to describe in
"all its <UNK> ( not at all : sorry , put it back in your pants ) glory ."
"but i wo n't , this being a public forum and ..."
"okay , i 'm scared he might read it and a girl has to preserve some mystery , does n't she ?"
at least that 's what people tell me .
it 's hard enough having my poetry about sex in the <UNK> out there for everyone to read and make solo love to .
tonight i interview a <UNK> of female drag queens for wide angle .
friday was my last day at my old job .
various responses from co - workers saying goodbye .
"some picked fights , some said stay in touch , others threw <UNK> - fits and ran out of the room ."
"the director asked me , before i left , if i would come back for <#> day and work for free ."
that 's why i keep staying in relationships that suck ( tm ) .
i got so depressed leaving that place that i could barely drag myself out of bed in the morning .
i just wanted to stay home curled in the <UNK> position .
and of course they took it personally when i came in late .
in the category of good news : i got a notice threatening <UNK> !
maybe urllink andy and i can be homeless together .
our <UNK> and filthy cardboard sign will say will right fer food
my reading on the 15th of may is at the <UNK> in <UNK> .
"it 's a funky old bar , last time i went it was full to the <UNK> with <UNK> ."
i hope to have some new stuff to read then .
last night i finally submitted my review of a friend 's book to <UNK> .
today is my second to last day at my current job .
"urllink urllink which "" monty python and the holy <UNK> "" character are you ?"
"( picture paul <UNK> , a <UNK> horse , a cold new england night , etc . )"
they are due to arrive on may 7th .
"that would make today , day <#> of the countdown ."
"( <UNK> softly to self , ad <UNK> ) ."
"i wo n't describe them , as some of you might be smart enough to figure out what they mean ."
"i have been invited to read during a band 's regular night , wednesday , may 15th , at some bar in <UNK> ."
"of course , it would help if i could remember the name of the bar ."
"by then , i will have started my new job as <UNK> director of a mental health site in the heart of bed <UNK> ."
my current co - workers predict i wo n't last a week .
i 'll last a week and a half . just because i 'm white
"i 'm white and <UNK> , but the <#> are not necessarily related ."
"on may 17th , my friend 's boyfriend is <UNK> rod <UNK> as he sings ."
"i 'll try not to giggle if rod goes into "" listen to the warmth "" mode ."
"on may 21st , sharon olds is reading at the barnes and not - entirely - noble at union square ."
"but : my therapist loves sharon olds as well , so maybe we can just go together ."
i need a urllink date . or maybe just another cat .
"oh , i love my new blogger look . plus"
anyone have any ideas how i can add graphics ?
"however , i did get an old piece , science gone mad , accepted by wicked alice ."
"<UNK> said they liked the piece i submitted , but that it needed a bit more meat . whatever ."
i have <#> interviews to do for wide angle .
"<#> 's of the man - poet i worship , todd <UNK> , and the other 's of the head of an all female drag queen <UNK> ."
"i like <UNK> , so that should be interesting ."
<UNK> is hanging <#> of my paintings in his cafe .
"just last summer , i was giving my paintings away for free at the art festival . and still people would n't take them ."
"now people pay money , hah ! and i wrote a new poem ."
"i attempted to do it in third person , and not use the word cunt ."
i 've been thinking about my voice lately .
"no , not the <UNK> , girly , <UNK> "" blonde "" <#> , but my poetic voice ."
people keep saying my poetry reminds them of <UNK> and i finally came across <#> of his poems today .
"before , i only knew him by reputation , hard drinking and swearing , <UNK> - living and people hating ."
"i also got a general impression of <UNK> , dirt and <UNK> ."
"but today i saw how he spoke about misery in such a <UNK> , plain way ."
"is it "" beauty is truth "" or "" truth is beauty "" ?"
"i believe his use of non - poetic language , images and <UNK> influenced a generation of <UNK> , and they in turn influenced me ."
and i go for that blood thirsty language .
"sharon olds , the goddess mother of the new wave of female <UNK> , speaks with every part of her body ."
i thought about who is this christine who is writing ?
"<UNK> smith , raises the body and its <UNK> to a new form of <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> - poetic and pre - <UNK> at the same time ."
i was going to include links to everyone and thing .
"they made me "" literary "" not just "" poetry "" editor for wide angle ."
so i get to pick both the fiction and the poetry .
i 'm hoping to get some really good stuff .
"thank you , urllink <UNK> , for linking to me !"
"( she 's the editor of small spiral notebook , the <UNK> de <UNK> . )"
i have urllink new paintings up .
"the photos are a little <UNK> ( damn you , <UNK> ! )"
new book ! or a near <UNK> thereof .
"unfortunately , i did n't stop to eat or move from my chair , so i got really sick ."
"but i sold my first copy , and hope to sell the rest tomorrow at the reading ."
although they tend not to buy at these women 's center readings -- i 've tried it before .
"if you want a copy , email me at <UNK> ."
"they 're <#> dollars and you <UNK> me a lot , cheaper ."
"for a look at the cover , go urllink here ."
"as always , if you want the "" real deal "" , the entire potato , the smashing tomato , go to urllink <UNK> ."
"my next reading is april <#> , <#> pm , church of the holy trinity , <#> e. <UNK> street , between 1st and 2nd <UNK> ."
you can come and see if god strikes me dead .
what <UNK> had to say about my poem : congratulations .
"they had the following to say about your work -- "" this poem just should not work ."
""" i 'm not usually <#> for list poems , but this <#> captured my attention and held it throughout the read ."
each word really makes you stop and think and consider its significance both <UNK> and in relation to the whole .
i particularly liked the <UNK> of ' the <UNK> of a woman ' which gets richer with each repeat .
"and , of course , the title really makes the piece ."
""" <UNK> , took up speed and strength toward the end . """
boss when he 's happy -- boss when he 's sad .
"everyone was incredibly nice and friendly , and the actual stuff read was better ."
the ratio of <UNK> to talent was <UNK> lower .
"<#> poems accepted at urllink can we have our ball back , which also <UNK> the most <UNK> and <UNK> todd <UNK> ."
"all i can think about is the wicked witch , "" i 'm melting !"
women from all over the city are welcome to join .
"i 'm on the literary steering committee for the center , and a member of the visual arts component as well ."

"only members can be included in the readings and special events , etc ."
it costs like <#> dollars a year to join .

"friday went not so well , because nick had some <UNK> problems ... but saturday rocked !"
i ca n't believe how many people were at the <UNK> !

"well , at least covered our gas to get out there ."
"if you were there and liked us , tell your favorite <UNK> about us !"
"we got video , we got pictures . got lined up on doing another wedding ."
we were only set on <UNK> the <#> songs we learned this week went over very well .
"we still <UNK> have a complete set , but give us a few more months , maybe <#> , and we 'll be up and running full force ."
"we have <UNK> we are working on , too ."

"once again , this is the page for my band , our adventures , news , <UNK> , etc ."
"coming up on may <UNK> , be sure to make the trip up to mary 's <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> to see us shake the walls down again ."
"in my opinion , there were only a couple of * great * band moments ... not including this <UNK> parking was weird ."
"there are <#> acres of yard , though , but those acres were <UNK> full of cars ."
"not , <UNK> , particularly worried about my own truck , but it was a hard place to get out of ."
"in reverse , check all the mirrors for side <UNK> , check rear - view , peer out window , let off the <UNK> , gently .... gently .... crash"
"he was parked in a stupid place , though ."
"my truck , though , has a fist sized <UNK> in the <UNK> and some blue <UNK> across the top of the <UNK> ."
"no damage done , <UNK> more comic relief for a stressful day , i guess ."
"but still , now everyone up there is gonna call me crash ."

"we did , however , get <#> new songs <UNK> down , and a good grip on another <#> ."
"yeah , not much about the band in this post ."
"just wasting some time here , <UNK> props to all my friends and the like ."
and april is also going to be seen <UNK> it up with <UNK> <UNK> at his lord <UNK> 's b - day bash in <UNK> on <#> .
"<UNK> i love the <UNK> , even though the <UNK> all moan about how we 're too loud ."
the place is just too small with too many weird angles .
"soooooo anyway , those of you who missed it , we did lay out a rough version of <UNK> 's "" let it ride "" ."
"except it 's big sugar 's version of the song , which rocks <#> <#> times more ."
we think it 'll be well - received !
"my friend dean came up and brought his recording equipment , and he has some nice stuff ."
i ca n't wait until he <UNK> it up .
"i think everyone else did , too ! ) and we <UNK> a song with him and it rocked ."

"there is a little bit of a waiting list , right now.. ah , still working on scanning the logo for the shirts ."
"i do the artwork by hand , being of the old - school <UNK> punk - rock type <UNK> ."
i have n't been able to balance and <UNK> it to my liking yet .
"the <UNK> river run , i am assuming it is on ."
i 'm pretty sure that friday night is going to be john <UNK> and a guy named jack .
"john 's a great <UNK> player , so he 's worth seeing ."
"musical <UNK> our first original is going to probably be a re - working of the song i wrote and often sing with <UNK> , home ."
"well , the original version of it is ."
"that'd be all the fits that 's news to print , guys ."
i do n't know who 's going to be playing friday .
something makes me think it 's <UNK> and jerry 's brick pig family blues band .
it could be the <UNK> or it might even be <UNK> blues .
finally got the band to do a big sugar song !
"actually , we have <#> we 're going to work on , but we worked on the best <#> tonight ."
"y'all should recognize it , even if you 've never heard of these guys ."
learning it tonight made me realize what a <UNK> band we really are !
we 'll add it to the set at the <UNK> river run .
trust me ! and while you 're waiting around ... buy some big sugar !
"we 're on for the <UNK> river run , as far as i know ."

"i 'll tell ya , the <UNK> have it made down there , they have their own golf course !"
shoot me an email if you want it and i 'll email it to you .
but it 's all i can do right now .
i thought of going onto <UNK> at a certain time for a few hours and letting anyone who uses it grab it .
i 'm not sure what s going on and why you ca n't download the song .
"<UNK> is having problems with a <UNK> in <UNK> , but i do n't see what that has to do with this ."
"someone else try , and if you can or ca n't get it , send me an email at <UNK> , please :) ( later ... )"

"and none of us ever break the law , right ?"
<UNK> this was recorded by dean <UNK> on <UNK> .
"oh , hey , someone was searching for "" version of let it ride song "" and came across this page ..."
each of us band members is grounded in different <UNK> jeff loves 80s metal .
"that 's where he 's from , <UNK> ."
"<UNK> likes a lot of stuff , a lot of classic rock , just good music in general ."
"nick , the <UNK> bro of the band , grew up on green day and music from the early 90s ."
but firmly rooted in 80s punk rock and dirty blues . and
"and it shows in how we approach the band , our <UNK> , what we play , how we play , and our general attitude about music ."
"because , as the mighty <UNK> says , there is no alternative to rock n roll"
"fun fest news well , we 're on for the sunday slot , from <#> to <#> pm ."
"we 're kinda hoping we can move it to saturday , but who knows ."
we 've added a ton of new stuff that'll make you happy !

the light was not <UNK> ... in that the shadow from the <UNK> on the stage cut all our heads off .
i guess we 're playing at the fun fest !
"no idea when yet , but i 'll put it here when i find out ."
"this kind of snuck up on me , personally ."
"hehe . should be <UNK> of joy , though ."
"other stuff for now , i have removed the mp3 ."
"i have n't had the time to get on <UNK> about why it did n't work , and i have n't checked to see if it worked ."
"so , hang on , it 'll be there eventually ."
"also lost my <UNK> access , but hopefully we 'll be able to have some stickers or hats or something for sale ."
"<UNK> we are n't as <UNK> as those guys , because we have no band pictures ."
"hey , man ... as soon as someone can get some , we will , though ."
* <UNK> * we keep <UNK> cameras or something ...
urllink black <UNK> vs. death mask and these are the guys who we are trying to work out some shows with .
urllink <UNK> this is the band that played before us at the fun festival .
"i missed them , so y'all are gonna have to go see them for yourselves ."
"i did say i was going to add links to local bands , and here is the beginning ."
"it 's a <UNK> service , and i have n't been able to read email to it in about a week ."
"with a template change , the page is up and running again ."
"i 'll have to <UNK> it to my satisfaction later , but this works for now ."
"lots of people got pictures , we 'll see if any turn out ."
urllink dale did a fantastic job running the sound .
"people showed up to see us who i certainly did n't expect to , and best of all .... we got <UNK> !"
"well , we have n't had much to say except "" go to the fun fest on the 22nd ! """
"so , i , as <UNK> , am going to do something to support other artists in the area ."
"i 'm going to add links to their websites , if they have them ."
"! we 're still alive , still playing , although only at the house ."
"if you 've emailed us at the <UNK> address , i 've had problems with it ."
"like , i ca n't always log in <UNK> well ... they suck ."
we played a wedding a couple of weeks ago in <UNK> point .
we seem to fill an odd little <UNK> around here that is n't getting filled .
more fun than <UNK> fish in a barrel <UNK> .
"<UNK> as usual , fan - fucking - <UNK> ."
and now i know what all the hoo - hah was about .
dude makes me wanna put my bass away and cry .
( as if ... i will torture people with my playing as long as i have fingers ) .
<UNK> i think they only played <#> songs ?
"black <UNK> vs. death mask had no clue what to expect from these dudes , but it was n't disappointing ."
"there were a lot of really great costumes , too !"
"there are probably a lot of pictures of those , too ."
i hope we get to do more stuff like that .
"we were the odd ones in that we played covers and everyone else has <UNK> ... but , hey man , our covers are <UNK> ."
( i was kinda self - <UNK> about that .
"erm , i 'm an idiot though and can be self - <UNK> about some stupid shit ) and dale got to hang around and see us !"
we 're off to <UNK> some <UNK> at tad 's in fabulous downtown urllink <UNK>
go to roger 's ! if you go in costume
"ok , i have a <UNK> in the back room ."
i 'm just <UNK> lazy to go get it .
"chaos <UNK> at roger 's zoo , october 26th !"
<#> bands and a dj ! <#> bucks ! costume party !
there will be a guy there running horror movies on <#> of the walls ... man
"morning <UNK> , <UNK> bar , and the <UNK> plant last night i <UNK> worked on some stuff for the cafe press store . without a <UNK>"
i 'd rather do drawings by hand and use them than struggle with <UNK> .
"all i 've got right now is a sticker , and i 'm takin it out today and tryin to add some more stuff instead ."
"maybe by the end of the week , there will be something up for sale ."
what 's up with the mp3 you may <UNK> well
", that annoyed me , and when something annoys me that much , i do n't tend to deal with it again for a while ."
"plus , it 's embarassing now to listen to that cd , because i think we 're so much better ."
i do n't really want to share it .
"if the rest of the band wants to , i <UNK> will , but for now , no ."
"roger 's <UNK> confirmed for <#> , but i gotta call john back ."
"* <UNK> * we 'll be playing with bc vs <UNK> and , hopefully , a scratch - mix dj they know ."
it 'll be <#> completely different kinds of <UNK> .
rolling wreck at roger 's got some ideas for dates with black <UNK> vs. death mask .
it was only a day or so ago that it got worked on any .
"if this goes through with black <UNK> vs. death mask , we 're hoping to have the song ready to play by then ."
"we have nothing set up for november as of yet , and a private party for mid - december , and a <UNK> new year 's show ."
"actually , this is , unfortunately , all <UNK> unless some things get worked out ."
the last gig at <UNK> 's went okay .
rock n roll most of the night saturday november <UNK> at <UNK> 's in <UNK> . <#> w. 1st st .
"starts at <#> , ends when we 're done ."
"well , everything has sort of ground to a halt ."
"( which i 'm <UNK> bummed about , but only because of my disease ... that need to play in front of people ) ."
"so , <UNK> we start back up again , info will be <UNK> ."
and now . .... a picture of a picture of the band .
"ok the local band links i have added are about to scroll , so , tonight i will add them to the side ."
"do n't nail that <UNK> shut , yet we 've been busy , <UNK> , and not - so - busy as a band ."
"things were sort of on hold a bit with thanksgiving , i guess , and some other stuff , and we are unsure what 's happening with the holidays ."
good <UNK> we are going to be playing at the urllink world 's christmas party this weekend . today
more good news - our first original song is probably <#> done .
"is "" get the hell <UNK> my porch or i 'm calling the cops , <UNK> "" ."
"much funny . <#> points . as mentioned in the email , no game this week ; i have to research a 13th century poem for a final paper ."
"i enjoy the work , but i 'd much rather have <UNK> adventure in <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> , formed by a <UNK> ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> , .... what ? a <UNK> ? ! ?"
"in an earlier post , <UNK> said : "" and then : what of <UNK> ?"
".... there is room for everyone , and for every player in the saga , glory <UNK> . but what glory will that be ?"
he gets it and does n't get it at the same time .
"he can understand the world as being a large and changing place , but seeing father <UNK> in the <UNK> plane ... well , freaked him out ."
"to <UNK> , it was basically like talking to a ghost , and that is just creepy ."
"even though he is actually experiencing it , he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind , "" yeah ...."
he would most likely never expect to rise above something between hero of the land and hero of the world .
"frankly , because he does n't really <UNK> the whole <UNK> thing , and even being "" hero of the world "" is kind of <UNK> in his eyes ."
"i 'd post this on the <UNK> blog , but i ca n't post there ."
could someone either post or e - mail me the resolution to the <UNK> situation ?
"as the original hook of our adventure , i 'm kind of curious ."
"# posted by <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> pm <UNK> was <UNK> during the collapse by <UNK> friends , and is now alive and well in the <UNK> ."
"the party talked with him in the office of din <UNK> <UNK> , who <UNK> on a <UNK> plane ."
"<UNK> is now dedicated to <UNK> contact with the gods , if possible ."
"he has <UNK> that the party join forces with the <UNK> , a secret society formed by the last <UNK> <UNK> at the very end of the great retreat ."
"the act broke the <UNK> , and the party was unable to follow ."
"players have the option of sending their character off to do something long - term , and create and play a new character ."
the world stage has <UNK> wide enough to <UNK> such .
"the answer to the first question lies with master po ; the answer to the second is sister <UNK> , the <UNK> who took over after <UNK> <UNK> ."
it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father .
he seems like the type that just <UNK> out of the ground .
"and if <UNK> really is his father , then why did n't he claim him earlier ?"
"since our next game is the weekend of halloween , why do n't we all dress up like our characters next session ?"
"- <UNK> , ruled by lord <UNK> , believed by the party to be a former <UNK> lord , who came to power by unknown means ."
"if email is <UNK> , we can always use this handy blog ."
i will make an effort to deliver <UNK> both here and by email .
perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back .
i do n't know why it did n't go through or why no <#> received it .
the only way ben knew what he did is because i spoke to him on thursday .
"i 'm going to stop using the <UNK> account though - if everyone could change my email to <UNK> , i would appreciate it ."
"regardless , we missed you ; hope your day was a good <#> ."
i do n't know how long <UNK> will last .
"i do n't see a reason to end it , as i am <UNK> committed to gaming as a regular activity in my life ."
"players may come and go , but i will be writing and running some sort of game as long as people want to participate in such ."
# posted by harmony : <UNK> <UNK> pm so does that mean <UNK> will last until <#> ?
"# posted by <UNK> : <UNK> <UNK> pm at my current pace , i will graduate in either <UNK> ' <#> or may ' <#> ."
sure takes a long time to earn <#> credits .
and i do n't even believe that <UNK> is actually dead .
i ca n't believe that powerful of a magic user would n't have a backup plan in case her body was destroyed .
"to be fair , <UNK> did n't directly frame the party ; that was ( supposedly ) the desire of <UNK> ( or , rather , <UNK> representative ) ."
<UNK> just wanted <UNK> dead and buried in his family 's <UNK> sealed <UNK> .
"i 'm going to stick with ian , for now . but having the choice is quite cool ."
glad you were able to get in this time .
let me know if you have any further trouble .
"was the hand mentioned as possibly being involved in our current <UNK> , in regards to the murder we 've been accused of ?"
"the party is now international in membership , and global ( and beyond ) in awareness of the world ."
the mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began .
"this may be frustrating to some , and i understand the desire for simplicity ( let 's just get the ring to mount doom ) ,"
"but it was always my intention to create a broad , organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory ."
i had done the single through - line campaign before ; i was interested in trying something with fewer ( if any ) boundaries .
which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters ' comfort <UNK> ?
"of the current party , <UNK> and connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake ."
"<UNK> has a personal journey to take that seems , at the moment , to be connected to the big picture in some unknown way ."
"<UNK> has a spiritual calling to right what has been changed , and it is natural for him to <UNK> the world on that quest ."
talk about an indiana jones red line map crawl . and
"should he return to the <UNK> and report what he has learned , or is he a free agent ?"
i 'm not <UNK> anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen .
"there is room for everyone , and for every player in the saga , glory <UNK> . but what glory will that be ?"
the hero of a world ? or the hero of the <UNK> ?
certainly questions worth thinking about . as i mentioned in the previous post
", all characters are welcome to follow their path to glory from the point where they started ."
"likewise , players are free to create new heroes should their characters <UNK> onto a path unique to themselves ."
"<UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are out there even now , making choices that matter ."
the same could be said of any character that chose to <UNK> off on his or her own .
"i enjoy their choices and their actions , both their desires and the things they do n't really give a flying <UNK> about ."
"all are welcome to do as they please , as they follow their own road to glory ."
"referring to <UNK> 's post , i think that the party clearly does not have the same goals ."
"this is fine , mind you , but needs pointing out none the less ."
"personally , i just do n't feel that <UNK> has evolved enough within himself to be able to <UNK> the <UNK> for him ."
he is still very much following his own set of goals .
"[ mon <UNK> <#> , <UNK> pm | hot chocolate ]"
"oh <UNK> , how i miss thee and <UNK> control over ye big <UNK> monk ."
"[ mon <UNK> <#> , <UNK> pm | john robinson ] <UNK> notebook my <UNK> notebook is currently <UNK> to mr ."
<UNK> via a <UNK> who will exchange for some <UNK> dvds when he next <UNK> a non - cancelled hand of <UNK> session .
"to <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> fame , <#> might consider this the story of a <UNK> in wwii ."
"what the player finds entertaining , rewarding , and <UNK> is often defined by what he or she chooses to be specifically relevant to the character ."
"of course , in a party of <#> characters , there are <#> separate lists of what is relevant ."
"otherwise , <#> is watching choices without clear motivation , and the result can be a frustrating chaos ."
"thus , the list of what <#> needs to know to function within the story grows a little bit longer ."
there 's no rule that says you must stay with <#> character throughout . once provided with the player 's basic <UNK>
", i would <UNK> the character somewhere out in the world until such a time that the player wanted that character to return ."
thus my interest in <UNK> some side games that occur elsewhere in the world 's history .
"this post , like many stories , seems to have grown with the telling ."
"dude , i have no idea where that notebook is now"
"i can keep most of it in my head , it 's just such an epic and i have such a hard time <UNK> the names !"
"the <UNK> and of course , the god of us all , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"[ mon <UNK> <#> , <UNK> am | harmony <UNK> ] early <#> ."
"a little over <#> years , i think ."
"[ mon <UNK> <#> , <UNK> am | hot chocolate ] how many years have we 've been playing now ?"
"[ mon <UNK> <#> , <UNK> am | harmony <UNK> ] thanks , chocolate ."
though a game is n't any good without players to make it so .
"[ sun <UNK> <#> , <UNK> pm | hot chocolate ] great game <UNK> !"
"perhaps you can make notes to yourself during the game , as john did ."
i <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to everyone at the beginning of the campaign for that purpose .
very interesting but hard to keep in head all at once .
- connor 's contacts in <UNK> = info ? - how did the party acquire the <UNK> ? - who wounded <UNK> and ian ?
big picture - <UNK> ; <UNK> keep ; possible civil war ?
- <UNK> vs. <UNK> : spring = war ?
- dragon 's <UNK> : worth going to right now ?
- giants gathering north of the <UNK> of the raven ?
- <UNK> is a gift and a key = <UNK> ? - what was going on at <UNK>
- can <UNK> be restored to <UNK> it was taken ?
"these <#> new blogs for "" glory "" and "" <UNK> "" have been designed for discussion about the respective games ."
it may also serve as a way for the respective game masters to get a feel of where the group is heading .
"please keep the random <UNK> to a minimum , so that we can maintain focus ; we 've got "" circle of irony "" for that !"
"testing ... <#> ..... <#> .... <#> ...... tap , tap , tap ."
i will be there for the entire game this week .
"even funnier if you replace the guys with a <UNK> , a <UNK> , and an <UNK> ."
joke moved to circle of irony err ... actually not .
forget it ever existed these are not the <UNK> you 're looking for .
"the road to glory is currently a quiet <#> , it seems ."
"you <UNK> your <UNK> someplace else , pal !"
"man , that was like <#> of the best games ever ...."
this makes me want to run a <UNK> crawl again : urllink <UNK> - <UNK>
"also , the blood of <UNK> is no longer present ."
only <#> witnesses remain of the winter 's edge festival that <UNK> the long road to glory .
"including the <#> new <UNK> , the campaign has produced <#> unique player characters so far ."
"what new , future souls may join the present struggle remains to be seen ."
"... but the spirit of the fellowship remains , so long as we hold true to the purpose of the <#> we sought and found ."
"given the discovery made after the <UNK> on <UNK> 's heavily protected auction , it is <UNK> if the party succeeded ."
"security concerns mean there is little opportunity for such contact with ordinary iraqis . """
"this kind of "" <UNK> "" sounds like the <UNK> in <UNK> ."
"once the use of force and terror stops keeping the <UNK> at bay , these "" <UNK> "" may have to seek <UNK> somewhere ."
this approach is killing americans in iraq every day ; will it also <UNK> the seeds of its own destruction here in november ?
urllink <UNK> tom 's usual excellent work is raising a couple of questions for me this afternoon .
"<#> . when some suggest we need to ' stay the course ' in iraq , what is the ' course ? '"
can iraq be a democratic nation when we are building <#> permanent bases there ?
is n't anyone interested in challenging the bush administration into asking for a little more detail on what a ' totally <UNK> ' iraq looks like ?
"these pictures have been out for about <#> weeks , and they have already convicted the first private ?"
are these guys taking the fall while <UNK> runs free ?
here 's another <UNK> gem from this morning .
"but we will seek to obtain that in the future through normal intelligence channels . """
"the next line of the story says , "" u.s ."
"officials have said they had doubts about the intelligence the inc provided and about whether <UNK> was motivated <UNK> by a desire for power . """
"so there are doubts about the quality of the inc 's intelligence , but <UNK> said it was "" very valuable . """
"this makes the administration look like that cop in <UNK> , shocked to learn that <UNK> might not be a <UNK> source of information ."
why are these guys always the last to know ?
""" president bush said an <UNK> iraqi president , prime minister and other top <UNK> should be selected in the next <#> weeks ."
he plans to lay out a detailed plan this week for the <UNK> he called ' full transfer of <UNK> . '
""" i 'm reading over the last sentence of each paragraph ."
"how exactly does a country have "" full <UNK> "" when the security forces within its borders are under the control of another country ?"
"urllink <UNK> tom 's work ( and here , that of robert <UNK> ) reminds me of reagan 's deepest influence in america today ."
"then came reagan , reminding us of those glorious new deal and marshall plan days , and we got to forget ."
"unable to defeat a <UNK> nation in asia , we challenged the <UNK> to <UNK> us on <UNK> ."
"wounded from congress ' checking the president 's power , we <UNK> to see the white house <UNK> again ."
damn if it did n't feel great to be in america again .
now we live with the consequences of those <UNK> .
"now the world hates us , and we refuse to see it ."
"now we are more addicted to oil than ever , but we have done nothing to get off the black junk ."
"now we <UNK> personal liberty , and we say we feel safer ."
"it might feel good inside that bubble , but it 's sealed pretty tight and we 're running out of air ."
"in november <#> i was <#> months shy of <#> , so i missed getting to vote against ronald reagan ."
reagan 's death last weekend has left me with <#> reactions .
"first , listening to politicians fall over themselves <UNK> the great <UNK> , i realize just how far richard nixon had fallen from grace ."
i do n't recall his death getting nearly as much <UNK> respect .
nixon = national institutions <UNK> ; reagan = <UNK> <UNK> over purple waves of grain .
"if i were bush , i would n't be <UNK> too closely in that reflected glow ."
had a bad dream last night - need to process .
"mostly it was <UNK> and i screaming at each other , mostly about money ."
things are so tight right now i feel like screaming for real .
"i would do whatever , but i was trying to get across to her that she had <UNK> expectations ."
"of course , all the while , yelling at the top of my lungs ."
"while i was "" explaining "" my position , she just turned and walked away ."
"it <UNK> help , that the first thing she asked me after we were both up was"
""" so can i still not go shopping for school supplies today ? """
"i did n't yell , but i have been a bit cranky this morning ."
the dream really hits on my feeling inadequate - esp .
"i work hard at a job i enjoy , but i just do n't make enough money ."
"we could live on what i make , but not where we are now ."
we would have to <UNK> all of our <UNK> except the house in order to make it .
"<UNK> probably wo n't be able to work much longer , and then it 'll all be on me ."
test today <UNK> <#> su <#> <UNK> <UNK> fuck .
"feeling a real need to write tonight , but i do n't know about what ."
"<UNK> is on the phone with her mom , having a hard time , and does n't want me near ."
"she has to go to work , has to do church , thinks she has to put on for the world ."
"i 'm hoping she wo n't , but i get afraid she may - being in as much pain , and as much pain , as she is ."
a long time ago <UNK> asked me what sign i was .
""" what ? <UNK> , or that you 're a <UNK> ?"
""" "" both "" "" ' <UNK> ' means that i was n't sure ."
""" i thought for a moment and let it sink in . """
"to this day , i do n't now why ."
"mom called to wish <UNK> a happy birthday , and i did n't tell her to fuck off ."
"i felt like it , but i did n't ."
"i did tell her that the <UNK> had denied my case , so once again the bastards get away with it ."
"but , i told her i expect her to keep a close eye on the kids ."
"maybe it 's better this way , rather than just cutting her off ."
<UNK> still thinks i 'm mad ( or should be ) at her .
"what makes me mad is her trying to decide what my emotions are , and telling me i 'm not facing things if i do n't appear to agree ."
"so , do i continue to communicate my thoughts , or do i go back to letting her put emotions in my head ?"
my days do n't seem as <UNK> as they have this past week .
"it is not a feeling , but an act of the will ."
"as neil anderson has written , "" do n't wait to forgive until you feel like forgiving ; you will never get there ."
"feelings take time to heal after the choice to forgive is made . """
"we acknowledge that it hurt , that it mattered , and we choose to extend forgiveness ( to the <#> who hurt us ) ."
"this is not saying , "" i probably deserved part of it anyway . """
"forgiveness says , "" it was wrong , it mattered , and i release you . """
"all right , i know why i was so <UNK> today ."
", it 's still over <#> at almost <#> pm , but that only <UNK> the <UNK> ."
"the little <UNK> on the way home from <UNK> and andy 's may have been a bit out of the way , but it was right on the map ."
"* * * * * * in the morning , after some sleep ( shut up , <UNK> ! )"
* * * * * * * * * feeling a bit <UNK> today .
what the hell am i supposed to say ?
"i 'm building this damn thing to correct an organization problem , and i want to do it ."
"if you hate it , tough shit , it 's my house , too . """
"i feel no sense of ownership , no power to make decisions around here ."
"then she wants to know why i do n't ever <UNK> , or <UNK> , or do serious cleaning ."
i just wish she 'd trust me to do something that wo n't suck .
now i do n't even feel like doing it at all .
"the cd cases we have are not very well organized , she wants to put them on the wall ."
i wonder what would happen if i just said what the hell and did it ? without permission ?
"ooh , the <UNK> ! the real hell of it"
"is , i was nervous before i approached the topic , wanting to do it so she 'd agree with me ."
"but damnit , i want to be right , completely right , just once !"
"well , i do n't know what i 'll do , ok ? ! ?"
"... and speaking of pissing off parents , ( or getting pissed on by said )"
i got a * wonderful * email from dad today .
"i did n't feel her ' pain ' , i felt like <UNK> ."
"he was a marine , i wonder if he can "" handle the truth "" ?"
. no wonder my life is so screwed .
i just re - read my previous entry .
why do i let my mouth ( in this case fingers ) go so off ?
"i wish i could express my frustration without <UNK> to <UNK> , but sometimes it is the only thing that fits ."
"but if i say ' fuck ' to mom , she 'll probably have a heart attack ."
"lord , forgive the way i vent my frustration ."
"i know feeling frustrated is not wrong , but what i do with it <UNK> my current relationship with you ."
"right now , i feel like everyone around is having dinner with you , and i 'm the <UNK> under the table <UNK> for <UNK> ."
"i know you did n't make it happen , my abuse was the result of someone elses ' <UNK> actions , but i am still stuck with the pain ."
is it wrong to wish some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ?
kind of a taste of the eternal ones waiting ?
"forgive my <UNK> , at this point i 'll be really upset if i see them in heaven ."
turn this wicked crap ( i have no other word for it ) into <UNK> .
grow something so beautiful that people wo n't believe what kind of shit it 's grown in .
"<UNK> you that i can be honest with you - bone - <UNK> , gut - <UNK> honest ."
"if my language <UNK> , i 'm sorry ."
help me to develop a new <UNK> to fit the new creation you 're making with me .
i saw a bumper sticker that offended me today .
"it said "" if it ai n't king james , it ai n't a bible ! """
"after all , do they really believe that god speaks king james english ?"
"well , if you read certain famous fiction writers in the christian world , it must be so ."
"not only god , but any prophet so <UNK> , even !"
"when i get to heaven , will god look at me and say , "" well done , thou good and faithful servant "" ?"
"<UNK> , i rather think he 'll say something like , "" hey guy , ya done good ."
"have a seat . "" to a good ole southern boy he might say "" y'all come on <UNK> <UNK> and set you down a spell ."
"to the bud guys , he 'll just scream "" <UNK> ! """
"after all , there are other <UNK> of the bible , earlier ones , better ones ."
<UNK> translated from greek into spanish even before <UNK> did english !
why does <#> remain the <UNK> of bible translation ?
i just ca n't seem to trust someone who will put their whole <UNK> focus on when a bible was translated .
it is a slap in the face to all of the scholarship and hard work that has been done in the last <UNK> years .
"then again , according to the <UNK> , i do n't even have all of the scripture !"
guess i need some of them golden <UNK> or something .
all of this <UNK> makes me wonder about myself a bit .
what do i expect to gain from it ?
* left turn * i ca n't stop being pissed at mom .
"i want to ( so i tell myself ) , i want to do the right thing , the christian thing , the thing christ himself would do ."
"but then , christ himself <UNK> those who would harm children ."
"does that extend to not actually <UNK> , but allowing harm to come to and not doing shit about it ?"
"i hate when i get this way , i just seem to go round and round and go no - fucking - where ."
"out there , walking free , are <#> cold hearted bastards who fucked me over ."
i reported it to the police - got <UNK> .
but what i did get wo n't keep those <UNK> away from any kids .
i tortured myself for months ( still am ) and their <UNK> seem to rest easy .
"if i do , it 'll have to be an <UNK> ignore - send the presents back ."
"i told her i 'd do it , but i do n't know if i have the guts to stick to it ."
"i guess they got fucked out of me a long , long time ago ."
i 've run across this quote <#> times in different places in the past <#> days .
"the credit belongs to the man in the arena , whose face is <UNK> by dust and sweat and blood , who <UNK> <UNK> . . ."
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * gotta ponder that . . .
i just realized - if <UNK> wants to find this page she can with little difficulty .
"duh , the <UNK> is right there on the desktop !"
<UNK> asked me what the next step is .
"it kinda threw me , i thought we were still exploring the first <#> !"
"i told her i wanted to start dating again , but it 's difficult to plan anything when i have no control over the budget ."
"we may ( budget allowing ) have worked out a solution to that , and rather <UNK> , too ."
"she liked the idea , i have n't told her it was the only thing i could find the <UNK> bit positive about <UNK> ."
"i still think the whole idea sucks , but we seem to be putting it on a very back burner ."
i just want to push it off the stove <UNK> .
we seem to be heading toward the path to healing .
"what worries me is that whenever we seem to be on the right road , something <UNK> us right back off of it ."
i 'm not likely to put anything really <UNK> in either .
"i operate my private life like a spy , nothing in writing , destroy any evidence ."
"it 's a little hard to destroy my brain , though ."
* * * * later in the day * * * * * * * * just woke up from a nap and my head 's still fuzzy .
spent the morning cleaning ang fighting with beth .
why is it that she can so easily push my buttons ?
<#> years of this shit to go . . .
"i should go to sleep , but i ca n't , and i do n't want to ."
"been chatting w/ <UNK> and mark , both at different <UNK> of the same conversation ."
"what happened , where did it go wrong , how to fix things ."
"i pray every day things will get better , and if i could will them better , they would be ."
but do i have the will to act ?
.. seems to be the <UNK> of the problems .
"i found something i wrote <#> years ago , i think it 's what i want ."
"a wise <#> once told me : "" if it 's just bodies , it 's not making love ."
"if it 's just minds , it 's friendship ."
"if just souls , a connection . until you <UNK> all <#> my child"
", you 're just going through the <UNK> ."
so how do i connect with someone who feels they 've betrayed all of that ? . .
"well , did n't run , but got posted ."
i 'm telling mark about the troubles <UNK> .
"i guess he might know how it feels to be asked to split , but then again , i 'm not going anywhere ."
the real reason i hate <UNK> is that you ca n't bullshit yourself .
we 'll see how this goes . . .
"i guess eventually i 'll get over the idea that i need to write for someone , rather than just to write ."
"i mean , * i * have my thoughts , why should i write them down ?"
"they 're in my head , after all ! '"
"your honor , the <UNK> for the defence is <UNK> , attempting to enter side tracks to avoid the truth ! """
"speaking of <UNK> , i just found my poetry journal ."
"reading these , i realize how hard i tried to be anything but me . '"
though this <#> is cool : upon my teeth and tongue words slip and bubble <UNK> around until they meet with a thought and become meaning .
i guess i 'm trying to say that i babble a lot .
"yeah , anything to avoid getting to the heart of a matter ."
"well , i want to write more , but <UNK> will be home soon , and i need to get the kids put to bed ."
"maybe i 'll get back tomorrow , if i have the time ."
"i needed a journal , and here it is ."
"this is mostly for my benefit , a way to sort out without having to leave the computer ."
"if anyone gets frustrated because i 'm not posting fast enough , get over it ."
"this is my brain , and if you wanna peek , you 'll do it on my time and my terms ."
when does <#> of us ( me ) try to <UNK> everything ?
"i ca n't decide if i really need to write every day , or not ."
"sometimes there 's not much that seems like needs to be said , sometimes there 's so much it <UNK> up and wo n't come out ."
right now i 'm just so busy and tired that i ca n't seem to want to spare the time at the end of the day .
"the stress is <UNK> a bit , but i think i 've just decided to keep my head down and <UNK> through ."
"it 's safer that way , and we 'll get through ."
i wish i knew why i am so on edge .
"i feel just about ready to snap , and god help the <UNK> ) who are in the blast <UNK> <UNK> that happens ."
it 's not like i 've had a stressful time lately or anything .
i really have no reason to be bitter .
"i 'd like to have a good reason to completely trash someone , like i did before i went to <UNK> ."
"you 're not a <UNK> anymore , <UNK> ."
"so , i have to find out how to get a hold on the <UNK> and stop this <UNK> fury before it gets loose ."
"oh , that it would be someone who deserves a real ass - kicking !"
it 's getting more and more difficult to just take a deep breath .
"lately i feel like all i 'm doing is deep - breathing exercises , like some sort of anger - management <UNK> technique ."
random musings : * i do n't understand american television 's obsession with the show american idol .
is this like the survivor of <#> years ago ?
"why have n't i ever seen this show , other than the "" top story "" on entertainment tonight ?"
* i ca n't wait for amazing race <#> .
amazing race is an extremely entertaining and well produced show .
"anyways , ca n't wait for it to be on ."
* i would n't be surprised if that was it for the <UNK> .
"it was still an ok show , and anderson cooper has moved on to cnn or something as a real news man ."
he probably is hoping <UNK> <#> never gets made .
* can not wait for football season to <UNK> love will <UNK> 's <UNK> williams jr .
impression ... they should replace the real <UNK> williams jr with <UNK> for at least <#> of the monday night football games ! )
"<UNK> reality recently , so - called "" reality tv "" has contained less and less reality ."
"i can see why they wish to do this - after all , people will tune in when there is a lot of <UNK> and drama ."
imagine if the nfl introduced a new rule during half - time at the super bowl that <UNK> affected the game ?
or if the finish line to a marathon were suddenly <UNK> during the race ?
"survivor , big brother , and all the copy - cat programs are , after all , a contest for real money ."
these producers must clearly spell the rules out to the players before the game begins .
"they can keep the tv audience in <UNK> , if they must , for tv ratings ."
but the players should not be surprised by some mysterious twist the producers dreamt up the night before to improve ratings .
"mark <UNK> , if your reading , please take note ."

"am about to quit smoking , do n't tell anybody since i might fail ...."
urllink why you should never urllink post your picture on the internet
is it just me or is anybody else having problems with urllink blogger and urllink firefox ?
"it sometimes stops to load the page , <UNK> code up and comes up with document / not found ."
"as you can see below , you can now use photos with urllink blogger without having a server , where you can upload your photos <UNK> ."
"you just have to download urllink hello select your blog , select a photo and <UNK> ther you go ."
"nice to have that , even though i will not use it for personal photos ."
"i installed a <UNK> , since i did n't like the "" last <UNK> , since they showed <UNK> the same entries as in the main column ."
my wife does not want anything blue or <UNK> in the garden .
"i found that a bit strange , but she was very firm with that ."
"seems strange , that i did n't know that , since we have been living together for about <#> years . wondering what else i might not know ..."
she is supposed to create a layout for our garden .
what was really strange was the fact that she just <UNK> say anything that we could get a grip on .
"it seems that everybody who wants to sell you something , that they <UNK> find a bit too expensive they will avoid the price like hot water ."

i request a major weather update including features a dry sunny weather :-)
"<UNK> , is all i can say about the new urllink blogger ."
"a complete new design , a brand new set of features ( like comments ) and a great set of default <UNK> , which where created by great <UNK> ."
"to make this blog semi complete , i have added comments and <UNK> ."
"i am quite sure , that i wo n't be needing them at all , but it feels awkward without them ."
"everybody keeps wondering , what the actual us army report about iraqi prisoner abuse is stating ."
the wonders of the internet have urllink made them available .
so this is going to be my home away from home ( meaning my other blog ) .
"some of them are not my best friends , so there are quite a few thing , that i would rather keep hidden ."
"after watching the urllink <UNK> last night , i am not <UNK> what to make of it . on the hardware side"
", there are urllink the new displays , which are nice but not terribly <UNK> ."
"there is urllink tiger ie <UNK> x <#> , which will be available in june <#> ( yes this is <#> year from now ) ."
"most of the new features seem to be a copy from existing tools : urllink <UNK> rss is nice , but the features are already covered by urllink <UNK> ."
"its nice to be able to <UNK> to an rss feed with the browser , but that s it ."
urllink dashboard seems to be a copy of urllink <UNK> .
urllink <UNK> is just an interface to <UNK> by click .
"that is nice and new and its totally integrated in the os , which is really cool ."
urllink <UNK> is a spoken interface for those with visual and learning <UNK> .
it is great that apple tries to make the os barrier free .
"not a feature for me.. urllink <UNK> av looks like fun , but i do n't think i have the <UNK> for that ."

"<UNK> created a great commercial , that they run on tv here for the time of the em <#> ( european soccer championship ) ."
"the server is very fast and <UNK> , spam - filter seems to be trained quite well , pages are not crowded with graphics and seem very clean ."

i like that <UNK> and the response to critique .
the urllink itunes music store is available in europe .
"currently eagerly awaiting urllink itunes music store for europe , which should be urllink announced in london ."
it will enable us to <UNK> download music ( hopefully for a price below <#> euro per song ) .
update : <UNK> europe will be hosted in <UNK> to benefit from their tax laws [ urllink <UNK> ]
urllink google has found this site and seems to index the pages .
"it took them about <#> <#> month , which i find remarkable , since urllink blogger is currently owned by google ."
"i would have expected instant <UNK> of new blogger sites , since the urllink technology is available ."
have yet to receive a urllink gmail invitation .
"it seems , that they are sending out invitations again ."
"since google has ignored this blog to date , i do n't expect an invitation any time soon :-("
"i love the way urllink apple creates just the product , that i have waited for ."
even though it 's been a month google is still ignoring this page .
i have created a <UNK> on <#> of my other pages just to speed the process up ;-)

"the label "" <UNK> "" is being tossed around quite a lot recently , usually by people who make no attempt to define what it means ."

"<#> handy insight from the article : no , <UNK> are n't <UNK> <UNK> ."
"<UNK> and said interestingly , christopher <UNK> and edward said maintained a friendship for years ."
here are links to articles by <UNK> that offer a much more <UNK> portrait of said than the <#> i wrote on <UNK> .
from the atlantic : urllink where the twain should have met .
<UNK> displays a sympathy for said <UNK> by a disappointment that he failed to live up to his beliefs .
in the nation <UNK> <UNK> said against <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ( update to my <UNK> entry ) that said urllink had <UNK> parts of his <UNK> .
"and in <UNK> <UNK> offers his urllink <UNK> <UNK> for said , a man he admired for <#> years ."
<UNK> and said also worked together on a book : urllink blaming the victims : <UNK> scholarship and the palestinian question .
"martin <UNK> wrote a short introduction to said and his theories at his excellent blog urllink <UNK> ( click on "" said 's splash "" ) ."
from what i can tell said deserves our <UNK> .
"in the end , said and the <UNK> <UNK> surrounding his theories can fairly be charged with promoting a dangerous ignorance that has cost lives , western and arab ."
said died at age <#> after a urllink long struggle with <UNK> .
update : edited the above to correct the use of post - <UNK> where post - <UNK> was appropriate .
"adding a link to urllink a story in salon describing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 's attack on said 's <UNK> , out of place : a <UNK> ."
see entry above for christopher <UNK> 's take on said .
the most hated person in america is ... ... osama bin laden ?
"no , not anymore ; the most hated person in the country is the <UNK> judge who handed down urllink this decision ."
maybe that 's why the story does n't identify him/her ...
"prediction : davis <UNK> by a thin margin , <UNK> elected by a similarly slight amount ."

i 'd forgotten what a <UNK> experience it was to travel by air on a <UNK> .

"they said the individual is <UNK> with officials , and they stressed he has not been arrested or <UNK> ."

she walks over in front of me and asks me a question .
i take my headphones off and ask her to repeat what she just said .
she goes up the stairs and i see her coming down the stairs on the opposite platform .
and it was <#> of those slow motion moments .
if it was in a film there would be some really cheesy music playing while the guy sees the girl of his dreams walking down the stairs .
she 's pulled up long skirt a bit while she walks down the stairs .
"now see , if she would 've had a short skirt on , it would n't have worked at all ."
"but the fact that she had a long skirt on and she was pulling it up , showing her knees , <UNK> and ankles ."
and i think i see the tag on her panties through the skirt .
the skirt comes down to just above her ankles .
the backs of the ankles were <UNK> and <UNK> .
the girl with the magic legs so i get on the q train this morning .
i look across from me and see this boots .
black boots that go up almost to the knee .
"jesus , this was all to <UNK> for me ."
i was terrified to look at the rest of her .
"so i get out <UNK> 's "" notes of a dirty old man """
i just use the book as an excuse to look at her knees and thighs .
"i mean , i 'm trying to appear as if i 'm reading ."
i like to be <UNK> when i 'm looking ...
"anyway , i just keep <UNK> at the words on the page ."
i finally get the courage to look at her face .
on first glance i think she has the face of a <UNK> .
the face did n't seem to go with the rest of her body and outfit .
"and with each quick glance at her face , the more sexy she became ."
at <#> point she pulls back her skirt a bit and <UNK> her thigh .
"meanwhile , i 'm thinking that this is the kind of woman i could look at for long periods of time ."
"i 'd go <#> subway stops past mine just to look at those thighs , knees and boots ."
i 'd come in an hour late for work .
"jesus , anything to look at the legs ."
at the trains pulls into the canal street stop she <UNK> her legs .
"she starts digging through her purse , which gives me longer time to look at her ."
"just before she gets up , she opens her legs just a tiny bit and i was incredibly close to getting a <UNK> shot ."
i would have much rather had her sit directly across from me so i could look those magic legs . and
not <UNK> of guys on the street looking at those legs ...
please bear with me while i try to get this bitch rockin ' ...
something was tell me i needed bust out from under that <UNK> shadow that i 've been <UNK> in . and
"as a wise man <#> said , "" we already have <#> <UNK> ."
"for those of you who do n't know about little mary , get thee to the urllink <UNK> zone immediately ."
sometimes i try to figure out who 's more mildly insane - me or the rest of the world ...
"but i think about it sometimes . and maybe "" mildly "" is too mild of a word ."
"hell , just plain insane is more like it . then , at times like this i put on "" pet sounds "" and grasp for clarity ."
maybe i do n't where the fuck this going ... and sometimes that 's a good thing .
"most of the sound is travelling through the vent near my kitchen , which i 'd imagine <UNK> the to the kitchen upstairs ..."
"there 's a lot of screaming , <UNK> and bullshit ."
"i think i need to put the headphones on , maybe some "" pet sounds "" and sleep ."
"but hell , every day it 's a search , man ."
"oh yeah , something i forget to mention was seeing urllink a skin too few , a nick <UNK> documentary that recently played at cinema village in nyc ."
"and while i did learn a few more thinks about nick , i felt like the director could 've tried a bit harder ."
"granted , the guy did n't have much to work with as far as video goes , but i think he could 've interviewed more people ."
"paul <UNK> talked briefly about how nick influenced him and whatnot , but he was the only musician interviewed ."
nick influenced a hell of a lot of people ...
"ya know , the orders pay for the printing and all that ..."
"found these <UNK> in a notebook , not sure what it means ."
glued down coat <UNK> looked like <UNK> <UNK> .
you should try believing in something bigger than yourself .
"” just keep on looking , something ’s bound to turn up ."
i just came across a recent <UNK> magazine devoted solely to the clash .
a wealth of articles that span the history of the band .
"there 's a <#> - part story by <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> appeared in <UNK> , which i thought was especially cool ."
"here 's a bit i found quite interesting : "" joe kills the dull van hours with <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> is just about to start reading"
"the bit about <UNK> in the piano would later turn up on the big audio <UNK> song "" hollywood <UNK> . """
"well , it 's the first time in a week ."
i 'm trying not to make it too much of a habit .
"and for a sunday , a wonderful place to be ."
it 's raining - <UNK> thomas sat back down at the bar .
looked at <UNK> girls . stumbled out of the joint around 12:30 . walked down 1st ave .
"found out the l train was n't running , which really bummed me out ."
c and houston . still tempted to grab a cab . walked up houston to clinton street .
"it reminded me of the film "" stranger than paradise "" and <UNK> <UNK> 's song "" famous blue <UNK> . """
"i pass the <UNK> lounge where i first heard <UNK> 's "" so broken ."
""" i thought about the girl i was with when i heard that song ."
"i took a left on <UNK> , walked a few blocks to the f train ."
it must 've been around <#> am by now .
there i sit on a bench in the <UNK> station .
there 's a girl with a red shirt a few seats down .
i start to write what i 'm writing now .
i get on the train and sit across the girl with wonderful red painted <UNK> .
"i play <UNK> <UNK> 's "" famous blue <UNK> "" and i think about clinton street and i wish it was december ."
another gal on g train late friday night on the g train .
she looks like this chick from chicago i met when i was <#> .
but then again i 've got <#> of those crazy musical memories where a song can immediately take me back <#> years .
the memory 's as fresh as yesterday ... but back to this chick sitting across from me .
but it 's gone the second time i look at her .
"speaking of passed out chicks , that reminds of another girl i knew in high school , but i 'm not gonna go there now ..."
"i would n't you , dear reader , to get the wrong impression ..."
"from "" full metal jacket "" : <UNK> you write "" born to kill "" on your helmet and you wear a peace button ."
"what 's that supposed to be , some kind of sick joke ? !"
"<UNK> you 'd better get your head and your ass <UNK> , or i will take a giant shit on you !"
<UNK> now answer my question or you 'll be standing tall before the man .
"<UNK> i think i was trying to suggest something about the <UNK> of man , sir ."
"i felt an urge to explain the title of the blog . "" lazy , flawed and hopeless "" is the name of a wonderful song by urllink <UNK> ."
"the tune is off an equally great album "" <UNK> . """
"while i know i can be quite lazy at times , and i know i 'm flawed in many ways , i would n't exactly say i 'm hopeless ."
"maybe the year before that too , but i 'd like to think i 'm beyond that now , though at times i might say i 'm hopeless . or"
"this blog used to be called "" notes of a dirty young man , "" an obvious <UNK> to <UNK> 's "" notes of a dirty old man ."
""" then i realized there were a few more blogs out there with the same name ."
it 's like walking down the street and seeing a guy with the same exact shirt you 're wearing .
"i do n't wanna be like everyone else , dammit ... all right enough bitching and bullshit ..."
so i 'm still searching for a more <UNK> title .
"in the meantime , i 'd like to thank the <UNK> dudes for the title inspiration ."
it opens in ny june <#> at cinema village .
"i knew sean penn , <UNK> and others were in it , but for some bizarre reason i did n't know my boy tom waits was in it ."
a review of the film is urllink here .
ended up at doc <UNK> 's for the first time in about a year or so .
he wanted to go to some bar with a hottie behind the bar .
next thing ya know we 're <UNK> $ <#> <UNK> while george jones plays on the <UNK> .
it was slow so the bartender asks if anyone wants to shoot pool .
"out of about <#> guys at the bar , no <#> goes for the <UNK> , so my cousin jumps on the opportunity ."
"so the bartender is <UNK> over the table , lower back showing and it 's a wonderful ."
"would find out later she 's from <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"my cuz beats her , which i consider a bad move ."
i tell him he should 've let her win .
"anyway , after a <UNK> , this guy shows up ."
"big guy , long <UNK> , <UNK> around his head , tattoos all over arms and on the side of his face ."
<#> minutes later this guy sounds like a very cool guy .
so then somebody left a plastic crab and <#> <UNK> girl dolls at <#> of the tables .
"jesus , i can not escape the <UNK> thing ."
there are just time where the bastard is like an older brother or a drinking buddy or something .
"so now the title of the blog is "" the insane always loved me , "" a great fucking poem from "" love is a dog from hell . """
and i hope i 'm not coming across as some <UNK> wannabe and all that bullshit .
i know i 'm influenced by the guy a great deal .
"no doubt about that . and if the shit gets tedious , <UNK> and all that , i hope somebody calls me on it ."
"so from no on , i 'm just going to let the flow as it will ."
and i 'm going to write about me too .
"i know i 'm mildly insane myself , sometimes more than mildly ."
"but hey , i can embrace it , accept it and <UNK> it ."
you ca n't just stuff the madness into the <UNK> garbage <UNK> .
"so i ended up at the <UNK> poetry club last night for this "" <UNK> : born into this "" ny <UNK> party ."
"they showed some clips from the film , which opens tomorrow in ny at cinema village ."
then people took turns reading their favorite <UNK> poems .
"it started with people reading on the stage , but then someone got out the wireless and it got passed around the bar ."
"i had "" tales of ordinary madness on me "" and i read my favorite passage from the book ."
"aw shit , i can not do it justice by <UNK> it ..."
"i 'll just give you the entire paragraph i read : "" and speaking of shit , <UNK> has always been a greater fear to me than cancer ."
"and if you 've ever tried to suck your own cock then you only know the terrible strain on the <UNK> , <UNK> , every muscle , everything ."
"god , or whoever the hell , knew just what he was doing when he put us together .... "" but back to the insane . """
"basically she flat - out said , "" will you kill me ? """
there were a few times down in <UNK> where many drinks in a few hour span <UNK> any <UNK> of time .
and i would somehow end up in the beds of large - <UNK> women .
so back to this chick who wanted me to kill her .
"i 'm realizing that i could fully develop this whole thing into a short story , but i 'm feeling a bit lazy , flawed and hopeless now ."
so i 'll just give you the good parts .
i 'm not going to give you some henry miller babble <UNK> about the world in the crack of a woman 's and all that .
i do n't think either <#> of us would appreciate that .
this chick says she wants me to kill her right after we fuck .
she says something about how i 'd just fucked death and that she does n't feel anything any more .
she wants to float down a river and die .
meanwhile i 'm all sweating and <UNK> and bullshit .
"this is all too much to take right after some heavy pumping , all right ."
"still sweating , still <UNK> like the hairy , sweaty , <UNK> bastard i can be ."
i imagine her pulling a knife out from under her pillow and <UNK> a big chunk out my lower back .
then it seems as though she 's gone to sleep .
i try getting out of this <UNK> her bed was on .
"but it starts <UNK> , which wakes her up ."
she asks me to throw her <UNK> up to her .
she puts it on and comes down the ladder .
i 've got my shirt on by the time she gets down .
i 'm just eager to get the fuck out of her place .
i look at the skinny poster on her wall .
it was n't the same as this : it looked like he 'd <UNK> shit all over himself .
i would find out later it was peanut butter .
"<UNK> already did the shit - <UNK> thing , man . ..."
"anyhow , so i 'm sitting on the couch with her ."
"whatnot , saying i was too "" warm "" of a person to do what she 'd just done ."
then she starts talking about how death just passes from <#> person to another .
then i remember she 'd told me she was a social worker for kids who 'd been <UNK> abused by their siblings .
"i get my bike out of her car , which i was fully prepared to leave if i had to ."
"i get on my bike and <UNK> as fast i can back to my house , an old <UNK> <UNK> house i 'd heard was once a crack house ."
"holy fucking jesus , that whole thing did n't just happen ."
sunday night is always a good night to go in there .
"and when i say "" kids "" i 'm talking about the college <UNK> that fill up the joint on weekends and after <#> pm ."
"that silly fucking tv show that 's a <UNK> of "" american idol "" was on the <UNK> network ."
"never use it unless i 'm watching <UNK> , <UNK> or max hardcore videos ."
"but if a tv is on in bar i ca n't help but watch it , especially if there are n't any <UNK> in the place ."
they 're each big in all the right places .
"jesus , i ca n't believe i just wrote that sorry ass fucking sentence ."
but i 'm gonna leave it for now .
i find out i 'm right a few minutes later .
"turns out they came to the holiday because the bouncing souls wrote a song called the "" holiday cocktail lounge ."
""" i tell them madonna used to hang out in the place ."
"then i tell them that her song "" holiday "" was an <UNK> to the bar , but i 'm not sure if it 's entirely true ."
"anyway , then it turns out that band is from the same part of florida the girls are from ."
"all right , it 's time to get down to some real shit ."
<UNK> ai n't no fucking good unless you 're a porn star or some bullshit .
"anyway , a few needed rounds at the holiday have <UNK> this ."
that 's going <UNK> the flow . or what 's ever left .
"this may now seem entirely <UNK> , but that does n't matter ."
i 'm going to try to get down something somewhat <UNK> and all that .
"<#> of my favorite scenes from "" blue in the face """
"i know there was a reason i posted that "" full metal jacket "" scene ."
"that whole "" <UNK> of man "" concept has been fascinating me lately ."
"i 'd like to go into further detail about it now , but i do n't know if i 'm fully equipped ."
"i 'm not sure if i should listen to "" pet sounds "" or the "" <UNK> orange "" soundtrack . but"
"then again , maybe all this shit is just for effect ."
"there has n't been much insanity lately , that 's why i 've been focusing on the music lately ."
"but i have a feeling something really strange and beautiful will happen tonight , hell , at least i hope so ."
"i need insanity to keep me sane , or something like that ."
i 'm not sure if that makes much sense .
i 'll have to think about that for a while .
"i 've been listening to michael blake 's latest record "" blake <UNK> "" and i 'm digging it , man ."
i first caught blake a few years ago at the knitting factory .
"he was <UNK> with this bass player , whose name <UNK> right now , steven <UNK> ( of sex mob fame ) and a few other cats ."
i was instantly drawn to blake 's <UNK> playing .
after the show we were trying to figure out who was playing <UNK> on the cd that the bartender was playing .
i thought it sounded a bit like <UNK> gordon .
"blake <UNK> it might 've been <UNK> <UNK> , who played on quite a few <UNK> records ."
"i 'm not sure if we ever found out who it really was , but i 'm guessing it was probably <UNK> ."
"the first track on the record , "" dick 's <UNK> , "" always <UNK> me out ."
so i 've seen blake quite a few years in the past few years .
the title is easy to remember since i 'm a big fan of <UNK> 's films .
"so i was quite happy to see that the song is included on "" blake <UNK> ."
a <UNK> of <UNK> dudes also do some great stuff on the disc .
"<UNK> <UNK> ( piano , <UNK> <UNK> ) , drummer <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> play some heavy stuff throughout "" blake <UNK> . """
""" blake <UNK> "" is a damn fine album ."
"for more info , check out michael 's urllink web site ."
"man , it 's <UNK> ' my heart that all these amazing musicians have passed away recently ."
i feel like it 's kind of pathetic to see <#> of the world 's greatest jazz <UNK> just once .
but then again i 've seen a lot of jazz <UNK> just once .
i 'm just glad to see these guys live .
so i saw <UNK> in boston a few years ago .
and he was back there smiling the whole time .
"and if you have n't heard <UNK> play , i 'd recommend most of the <UNK> <UNK> he did with <UNK> , especially "" <UNK> . """
"and of course there 's the <UNK> "" a love supreme , "" which is <UNK> as <#> of the greatest jazz albums of all time ."
and now for <UNK> reason i 'm struggling with more words to say about the guy .
i could go on and on and praise the guy for days .
let me just say he was an incredible drummer . and
"<UNK> <UNK> , man , he was a fine jazz guitarist ."
"maybe a bit <UNK> , but a great guitarist ."
"he did quite a lot of studio work , namely the beach boys epic "" pet sounds "" record ."
"<UNK> played the opening guitar line to "" would n't it be nice . """
"he also played with <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , charlie parker , <UNK> young and sat in a few elvis <UNK> studio sessions ."
i had a <#> gibson <UNK> <UNK> model guitar for a while .
"i held on to it for a years and then sold it , partly because i did n't feel worthy playing it ."
"i was first drawn to the album because of his version of the song "" reflections , "" <#> of my favorite monk songs ."
"a few years ago i was at the <UNK> jazz cafe in <UNK> and this <UNK> player <UNK> <UNK> was playing "" reflections ."
""" he did a beautiful <UNK> of the tune ."
i talked to him after the show and he said steve <UNK> taught him that song .
<#> of them has this short <UNK> white skirt .
"all right , it 's the perfect skirt for looking up on subway stairs ."
a wise man once told me the secret of seeing up a girl 's skirt while walking up subway stairs is keeping a distance .
if you 're too close you ca n't really see anything .
someone said about <#> stairs is a good distance .
so i 'm trying to keep my distance but i 'm not seeing anything .
it does n't really matter that much to me .
if i see some <UNK> it <UNK> up my day .
then it 's up the second flight of stairs that lead outside .
sometimes you have better luck with this set of stairs because the breeze kicks up at the top of the stairs .
i 'm about to climb the stairs when this guy comes running past me .
he gets about <#> stairs from the girl in the white skirt .
"then , get this , he <UNK> down , as she gets to the top of the stairs ."
i was impressed by how bold the guy was .
"she 's on the pavement , walking by the <UNK> , the guy goes back down about <#> stairs ."
"hell , that skinny , shaved - head , bright - white <UNK> - wearing <UNK> just needed to see some <UNK> ."
he did n't give a fuck if people saw him trying to look up her skirt .
the <UNK> who sells stolen <UNK> . at least i 'm pretty sure he 's a <UNK> .
was pretty sure when his pants fell down just before he entered the door .
he put down his shopping bags as he slowly pulled his pants up .
"steve has seen the stolen steak guy dealer before , and he does n't want any stolen <UNK> ."
the guy wants $ <#> for $ <#> worth of steak .
"but he wo n't take "" no "" for an answer ."
"there are <#> guys at the bar , including me , and <#> lovely girl ."
i 'm afraid the steak dealer is gonna scare the chick away .
"hell , it 's just nice to look at something other than the tv and a bunch of guys while you 're drinking ."
and i ca n't help but looking at them while she writes in her little notebook .
and the steak dealer <UNK> <UNK> is getting in the way of my high .
here i am just wanting to get lost in the beauty of a single girl at the bar while drinking a beer .
i think putting my hands behind the guy 's head and forcing it into the bar repeatedly .
i think about doing this because this guy is a <UNK> <UNK> .
"jesus , <UNK> fucking stolen <UNK> to support your habit ."
"i try to be good , but <#> of these days i feel like i 'm going <UNK> and pull billy jack on someone ."
"it 's back to whole <UNK> of man concept that i touched on last week with that bit from "" full metal jacket . """
i think we all have a bit of that in us .
"i could go into this further , but i think the results might be futile at this present time ."
"anyway , so the <UNK> asks steve for some more ice for his ice tea ."
"why ca n't this fucker just leave , man ?"
"just grab your <UNK> 's bags full of <UNK> and get the fuck out of the bar , man ."
he picks up his bags and heads for the door .
but first he stops right near where the girl is sitting .
"i 'm <UNK> my ass off the <UNK> , ready to <UNK> on the fucker if he tries any bullshit with the girl ."
"fuck , just let the girl drink in peace ."
i 'm sure she does n't appreciate some <UNK> - ass stolen steak dealer rubbing up against her bare shoulder .
takes a good few minutes to light his cigarette .
more insanity ... sunday night in the holiday .
it had been a week since i 'd been there last .
"<#> guy is really skinny , <UNK> jeans . probably in his early <UNK> ."
but i would find out later it 's the way he talks .
it reminded me of the first time i heard joe <UNK> speak .
"i thought he was quite wasted . anyway , his buddy next to him is wearing a baseball cap ."
nose looks like it 's been broken at least once .
"about half down , his nose <UNK> to the right ."
"so then i find out the skinny guy , we 'll call him george , used to hang out with this chick ginger ."
it sounded like it had been a while since he 'd seen her .
"so he and buddy came to drink and talk about ginger , among other things ."
i would find out later ginger was once a <UNK> .
"i think she married a few times , but always had guys on the side ."
"as it turned out , most of the guys she married died ."
someone else said she was a serial killer .
"and if i heard correctly , i thought his buddy said ginger tried to poison him ."
""" the guy with the hat , big ears , and <UNK> nose says that 's <#> of his favorite song ."
he says he likes <UNK> ' jay <UNK> too .
then he says he some madonna tapes that he thinks are worth at least $ <#> .
i ask him if he ever saw madonna at the holiday before she was famous .
"george says that <UNK> the bartender "" is a nobody ."
then he sits down in the back and tries to talk to <UNK> .
meanwhile the guy with the hat and the ears starts talking to me about music .
"<UNK> 's still pissed that she was called "" a nobody ."
""" i 've got people trying to talk to me from both sides ."
then there 's fucking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around in his <UNK> skin shirt and his gold pants .
"holy fucking jesus , i need to get out of here , i thought ."
i felt like these freaks were taking my oxygen .
"then i think of a story about a ginger , with a <#> - <UNK> diamond on , punching some guy in the face ."
"she blamed <UNK> , but he was at the other end of the bar ."
and i begin to wonder if she really did kill these guys .
"well , the weird shit did n't go down saturday night as i hoped ."
i ended up drinking for an hour at the nancy <UNK> pub in <UNK> while i waited for a friend to show up .
"man , that place seems a bit out of place among all the hip bars and clubs and whatnot ."
"it 's the kind of place that should be either the east village , near penn station or in hell 's kitchen ."
it was a great thing that there only a few people in the place at 10:30 on a saturday night .
the last thing i need when i 'm drinking by myself and waiting on a friend are a bunch of drunk <UNK> .
"she sounded rather fascinating , but i do n't remeber the guy getting in more than <#> words ."
i 've been in that situation many times before .
"sometimes it was because i felt like i did n't have anything to say , other times i did n't have any other choice ."
but the bits i do remember out the gal was that she had a <UNK> when she was a teenager .
but she did her homework and then got stoned .
recently she 's been teaching some sort of martial art .
then i sort of tuned out after that .
someone put <#> <UNK> songs on back to back .
had a <UNK> jack thing going on his vocal delivery .
sounded like he was trying to <UNK> up <UNK> with every <UNK> .
it was more like he 'd just taken a big <UNK> hit
and he was trying to hold in the smoke while talking .
i got tired of waiting for the friend so i walked down <#> blocks to where the party was .
biggest apartment i 've been in while living in new york .
a few minutes after i got there the friend i 'd been waiting for called .
she was at the bar i 'd just been at .
i talked to a drummer friend who i had n't seen in few months .
"his dad played <UNK> with some heavy <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , including his great song "" spanish grease . """
"so then my friend and i cut out , caught a cab and headed to the east village for another party ."
"it was dark , man , candles and whatnot ."
"i could n't tell you what was playing , since <UNK> is a genre i have n't had the urge to explore ."
"sure , i can get down with some electronic , <UNK> and whatnot , but i ai n't too hip on techno , industrial and the like ."
"but then again , i much of a dancer ."
"but i have been known to get down on the funk , especially if it 's that dirty funk , man ."
that 's some shit i can really bug out to ...
"around <#> am , i was starting to wear down a bit ."
and i 'm getting too old to be really hanging tough at parties and shit .
i started off drinking too fast in the beginning and did n't really slow down .
we talked about the new metallica documentary that 's coming out soon .
"i said i 'd just seen the preview that afternoon when i saw "" <UNK> <UNK> ."
""" oh yeah , so speaking of that flick , i was amazed at the amount of <UNK> at the movie ."
i was tempted to get up in front of the screen and ask just how many people came in from <UNK> .
"actually i have n't seen too many <UNK> hats in the last few months , which i think is a wonderful thing ."
fucking <UNK> hats are the work of the devil .
"i 'm hoping they 're on their way out , along with <UNK> jeans , <UNK> vans and big belt <UNK> ..."
"i did n't find out exactly what they got the shut down for , but they 're open again ."
so then we got to talking about chinese food and how there 's an old myth that use <UNK> and rat in place of chicken and beef .
"i thought about how the "" chicken "" was sort of an off grey ."
"yeah , i know it did n't seem quite right ."
"i was paranoid for the next few hours , thinking i was going to get food <UNK> ."
", i had a <UNK> to that rag for about a year ."
did n't read nearly as much as i should have .
"but i felt cool holding it on the subway , looking at the cartoons and bullshit ...."
he 'd heard about dogs being something of a <UNK> in china and whatnot .
"so throughout the article he <UNK> around for restaurants that might serve dog , even though it 's against the law in the u.s ."
he <UNK> there might be some underground joint or <UNK> .
"again , i read this article at least a year ago and what i remember could be way off ."
"but what i do remember is that he finally found a place , maybe in queens , that would cook a dog for him ."
the only catch was that he 'd have to bring the guy a dog .
"he thinks about them getting <UNK> up and whatnot , turned into food , and then he chickens out . or at least i think he chickens out ..."
i 'm gonna see if i can track down the story ...
""" music is the best means we have of <UNK> time . """
thought about smashing heads against the wall and all that .
and then i started thinking about all the other shit that 's happened to me over the years .
all the people who have taken advantage of me .
all the people i 've let take advantage of me .
a guy sacrifices his own happiness for someone else .
a guy can bit his tongue for only so long .
a guy can only go so long with his balls squeezed between his legs like a bitch .
sure it 's a bit fucked to think these things .
i 've been writing it about it the whole weekend to try and flush some of this fucking anger and resentment out of my system .
and it 's working a bit . and getting drunk helps for a few hours .
but in the morning it 's there again .
but let me say i 'm a peaceful guy .
then the toss in the fact that i got <UNK> a few blocks from house .
"got punched in the jaw , shoved on the ground and my wallet stolen a few weeks ago ."
"jesus , all this shit <UNK> evil in a guy ."
"jesus , i think i just need a weekend alone in the woods of <UNK> ."
"just listen to <UNK> , read and think happy thoughts ."
"yeah , i know i can be a sick fucker sometimes , but i gotta come clean on what i saw today ."
so before work i stopped in the coffee shop near my crib .
it was quite crowded for your average thursday morning .
"while i 'm waiting for the gal to make my tea , i see this gal with an <UNK> ."
"jesus , almost everything i could want in a woman , at least as far as looks go ."
i get me tea and look around for a seat .
i sit down and realize i 've got a great view of the girl 's legs and skirt .
there 's a guy who 's blocking the view of the rest of her .
"so i stared at her legs for a half an hour , then left ."
i got on the subway and started writing the following in my notebook :
i just spent the last half an hour looking at this girl 's legs .
"jesus , i have n't had a girl do that to me in a long time ."
but the fact that i could just stare at her legs without her seeing me was fucking <UNK> . and
"like <UNK> has said , he could stare at a pair of woman 's legs for hours ."
"hell , if i did n't have to go to work i would 've stayed there as long as she sat there ."
"it was truly a magic thing , man , the legs crossing , the rubbing of the thighs , the scratching of the <UNK> ..."
"this gal just had amazing legs , <UNK> , ankles , feet , toes ... fucking beautiful ..."
i have a lot of good stuff to throw down ...
"in the meantime , think about these great words from charles <UNK> : "" if you never <UNK> , you 'll never win . """
"and speaking of music , another thing i 've been wanting to mention is writing about music ."
"there was a time , about <#> years ago , when i actually considered myself something of a music journalist ."
for some reason i 'm struggling with writing anything profound about music these days .
"lately , all i can really say is if something is good or bad ."
i just do n't have the energy to listen to something a few times and really analyze it .
when i try to critique something it just takes away from the overall listening experience .
"and sure , i 'd like to bust out some <UNK> <UNK> kind of <UNK> ."
"hell , i just want to listen , man ."
listen and not think about what to write about it . or think about who else it sounds like . and
try to plug in some hole so someone else can get some kind of handle on it ...
"so let me lay off the <UNK> thing , and talk about music for a bit here ."
"i picked up <UNK> <UNK> 's "" <UNK> <UNK> "" cd today ."
"as far as i know <UNK> was <#> of the few , or maybe the only , <UNK> on the jazz scene ."
"i 've never played <UNK> before , but i ca n't imagine it being that easy to play a <UNK> <UNK> ."
lets just say the gal <UNK> on the <UNK> .
"and while she got down on the some hard <UNK> on in "" in a minor groove , "" she got a bit more funky on "" <UNK> <UNK> ."
"all right , i think i just need to come clean here ... first thing is to quit <UNK> for being somewhat of a <UNK> ."
now i can move on to more <UNK> <UNK> .
"i had the day off today , so i had plenty of time to look at women ."
"bottom line , i just have n't had the chance to really look at them in the last few ."
but i have n't really been taking them in .
"i did look at the gal 's legs and feet and <UNK> for a good half an hour a few days ago , but that 's an exception ."
the main thing i took note of today were all the bra - less women .
"but then again , it is a bit <UNK> to look at ."
i was standing next to this blonde on the l train .
"so what if she was wearing red <UNK> <UNK> and purple let <UNK> , i was intrigued ."
"so what if she was about <#> inches taller than me , and i 'm almost <#> feet tall ."
i did n't want to be <UNK> about checking her out .
my main <UNK> was the red <UNK> and the purple leg <UNK> .
"oh yeah , there was the <UNK> mini - skirt , which <UNK> to my english <UNK> <UNK> ."
"jesus , i ca n't believe i just said that bullshit about the <UNK> thing ."
"but hell , i sure as fuck know that i 'm not the only <#> ."
"then , in <UNK> vision i saw that she was holding something with both hands ."
and i want to say it was white and <UNK> .
but i could n't bring myself to look over again .
i wanted to think she was holding a <UNK> . and
"as i said before , i 'm not going to apologize any more for being something of a <UNK> ."
", i really fucking doubt she would be actually holding <UNK> <UNK> on a brooklyn - bound l train on a monday night ."
"a few more quotes from "" a <UNK> of <UNK> "" : "" i am an <UNK> ."
"since man 's fall , his proper position in the universe has been <#> of misery . """
""" when <UNK> <UNK> you <UNK> , go out to a movie and get more out of life . """
""" in the beginning there was nothing , but it was kind of fun watching nothing grow . """
"these words open the cd "" total lee ! the songs of lee <UNK> . """
now i 'm listening to the <UNK> brothers play the tune .
it 's quite faithful to lee 's version .
"so let me go back to the "" <UNK> <UNK> "" soundtrack ."
i 've held off on seeing for a few months now .
it took on <#> of those <UNK> beautiful <UNK> for me .
because the music you listen to you and the groceries you buy at the supermarket say a lot about a person ... more on the grocery bit later ...
but it 's kind of like reading a book and then seeing the film .
"jesus , i my thoughts are all over the place now ..."
and i remember nearly everything she had in her shopping cart .
"see , on <#> hand seeing all that shit in her cart was turning me on ."
and something else told me that she probably would n't appreciate the subtle magic of a <UNK> film .
so i just went home and wrote a poem about her .
i think they started filming last winter in new orleans .
"and ya know , i really do n't know if will <UNK> could do justice to the role of <UNK> ."
i read somewhere that john <UNK> <UNK> to play <UNK> .
i 'd also heard that john <UNK> was up for the part a while back .
"hell , <UNK> 's from new orleans and all ."
the <#> writers did a pretty good job with <UNK> together <UNK> 's life .
"there 's an interesting bit in the book about robert <UNK> , the original editor of the book ."
"from what i recall , <UNK> was working with <UNK> on the book , and apparently <UNK> told <UNK> he needed to basically re - write the book ."
"not too long after that , <UNK> disappeared for <#> weeks ."
a garden hose running from the tail pipe through a small crack in the window .
"i might be a bit off on those facts , since i 'm just going from memory ."
but that 's the way i remember it .
"incidentally , <UNK> also edited bill clinton 's new <UNK> ..."
"oh yeah , i had something of an <UNK> yesterday ."
i could smell his <UNK> <UNK> for a good minute after he passed me .
the this is what i came up with : <UNK> are the new <UNK> .
they 're the <UNK> of the new <UNK> .
i have n't had time to really flesh this idea out .
<UNK> as fuck while i waited for the q train .
by the time the train pulls into the station i 'm a sweaty bastard .
the <UNK> of sweat of <UNK> <UNK> on my forehead .
there was a seat next to this girl that i will mention later .
but i 'm not a big fan sitting right next to people on the subway .
i need my space . especially when i 'm sweating like a <UNK> .
"you 're not supposed to that , or at least that 's what the stickers say on the doors , but i do it all the time ."
and i 'm still sweating even though <UNK> is pumping .
sometimes it takes me a while to cool down .
things that i should 've done over the weekend for work .
there 's just something about riding <UNK> that does this to me sometimes .
it <UNK> thinking about all kinds of shit at once .
i start <UNK> on a section of the subway floor .
this morning i figured some <UNK> on the headphones might help .
i turn it up almost as loud as it will go .
"i close my eyes , take a few <UNK> ."
i 'm <UNK> the sweat from my head with both hands .
"then a guy gets up from his seat , but he ’s still standing in front of the seat . and it ’s bugging me ."
why ca n't he stand near the door if he 's going to get off the train .
i’m sweating and i just want to sit down .
"i feel like i’m going to pass out , or have a nervous fucking breakdown ."
i look at the girl with the blonde hair across from me .
she didn’t do that thing that most people do when they catch you looking at them .
"i close me eyes , still trying to concentrate on <UNK> ."
"i’m still <UNK> the sweat off with both hands , then <UNK> off my wet <UNK> on the legs of my jeans ."
"hell , chicks dig that kind of shit ."
"after i’ve calmed down a bit , i look at the gal again ."
"i notice she ’s wearing a unity t - shirt , obviously inspired by larry young ’s incredible “ unity ” album ."
"if you know the album , you’d recognize the shirt ."
"yeah , i think it 's a damn fine album ."
"larry on organ , joe <UNK> ( <#> of my favorite <UNK> players ) , <UNK> <UNK> on trumpet and <UNK> jones on drums ."
"anyway , i was quite impressed this gal was wearing the shirt ."
so i pull out <UNK> <UNK> ’s book of short stories and start trying to re - read “ <UNK> .
” but i couldn’t read because i was having a near - breakdown again .
"well , i don’t know if it was that bad ."
i’ve been thinking about this concept for quite some time .
and i’d like to think that i’ve been closer to that before .
and that was when i wasn’t really doing much with my life .
"to much time to think is a horrible thing , hell , unless you’re a <UNK> or some kind of bullshit ."
at least i can go to work and stop thinking about myself for the entire .
"that ’s a sad fucking thing to sit around and worry about shit , especially your own bullshit ."
"makes a guy want to write his own version of "" <UNK> "" or "" notes from the underground "" of something ..."
too much thinking is what makes a man go mad .
"oh yeah , i forgot to say what happened with the chick on the train ."
i took out my headphones as i walked up the stairs .
i just followed her through the farmer ’s market .
"now , that i’m thinking about , i think the main reason i didn’t say anything to her was that she didn’t give me enough to go on ."
"<#> of those shits where you can feel it in your gut , where just know the shit 's gonna come pouring out fast , <UNK> and clean ."
not <#> of those <UNK> where you 're it feels your <UNK> is getting ripped open too ...
so lets just say i think i 'm going to sleep better tonight .
it 's been quite hard to sleep with all this shit floating around in my head .
fear has really fucked me up for a long time .
fear <UNK> my in the gut on a daily basis .
"hell , i 'd think i would 've learned by now ."
you 'd think i would 've learned a lesson or <#> from all the thousands of times i 've been afraid to do something . and
"what 's funny is that i got the urge to watch "" donnie <UNK> "" again ."
it 's been a year or so since i saw it last .
"i 'm even tempted to check out the director 's cut of the flick , which opens in ny this weekend ."
"anyhow , fear has really fucked me up with women for years ."
"when i look back at all the women i 've dated , a majority of them were gals that i knew liked me <UNK> ."
"mostly i 've opted for the sure thing , or at least the almost sure thing ."
"hell , you never grow if you do n't challenge yourself ."
"yeah , it 's easy for me to say ."
i do n't why it 's taken me this long to realize what a genius <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
"and i say "" is "" because my notion is that writers never really die ."
or when i read books i always imagine the writer as still being alive .
. it 's the same thing when i listen to music or watch a film .
"although these artists might technically dead , they are <UNK> very much alive through their "" art . "" so back to <UNK> ."
i 've read him off and on for at least <#> years now .
""" <UNK> "" was the first thing i 'd read of his ."
it might 've been for a college english class .
"i thought it was a "" nice "" short story , but it took me years to realize what an extremely well - <UNK> piece of writing it is ."
i just got to thinking about this woman i had dinner with nearly <#> years ago .
i 'm guessing she might be <#> years older than me .
i 'd just started to get into writing and over dinner i asked her who her favorite writers were and she mentioned <UNK> .
i know i 'd read a few of his stories at that time . and
i might 've even said that <UNK> and <UNK> were my favorite writers .
i always appreciated a writer who did n't use all the <UNK> <UNK> to say something simple .
"i mean , who needs all the extra fat ."
"i think it might have been around this time that i read <UNK> 's "" hollywood "" in a college english class ."
it must have been ' <#> or ' <#> .
and it would take me a few more years to realize what a genius he was as well .
but this girl i knew from denver was in l.a .
so i picked her up and we had dinner .
she told me how she looked <UNK> up in the phone book .
many years later i was reminded of this when i read his poem about being listed in the phone book .
"he 's the reason i started writing this , not <UNK> ."
"and while i could easily start comparing <UNK> and <UNK> , i 'm not going to do that now ."
i think i 'll just stick to <UNK> .
""" i might already have a copy somewhere in my apartment ."
but i saw the book and i had the urge to read him .
so this particular copy i picked used to belong to a gal named <UNK> kelly .
"she wrote her name on the first page , not too far from that picture of <UNK> ."
"when i got to the l train station , i opened the book and flipped through the pages to see which passages she 'd <UNK> ."
"the only story she 'd really concentrated on , or at least as far as the <UNK> goes , was "" a small , good thing ."
"and as i read it this time around , i was reminded of the film where a boy gets hit by a car on his fifth birthday ."
so tonight i was sitting a bar in park <UNK> .
"tom waits was singing "" invitation to the blues "" on the <UNK> ."
there 's a girl by herself a few <UNK> down .
i look at her a few times in the mirror behind the bar .
i glance over and notice she has these amazing liquid blue eyes .
"i flip through the pages and stumble upon the story "" where i 'm calling from ."
as i read i 'm reminded of what an amazing writer <UNK> is .
fell into a well when he was <#> years old and the terror he suffered <UNK> and looking up at the mouth of the well .
graduates high school he had no idea what to do with his life .
it was then that he knew that he wanted that gal and wanted to be a <UNK> sweep .
i do n't think i 'm really doing the story justice by trying to <UNK> it .
but there was something quite beautiful in the way <UNK> tells <UNK> .
while reading this story i think i truly realized what a great writer <UNK> is .
i think i 'll leave it at that and hope you will read the story as well ...
they say people have about <#> or so dreams a night .
the thing is a lot of people rarely ever remember their dreams . but this <#> i had last night was hard to forget ...
"i had this feeling that she borrowed my electric <UNK> , and <UNK> off a huge bush into her purse ."
"all that was left was <#> of those <UNK> silly "" landing strips ."
""" i 'm not a big fan of those , or fully - shaved bushes . but in the dream the landing strip was working for me ."
so skinny her <UNK> bones are sticking out and all that .
she 's turning me on and all that . and
then i see her open purse on the bed with all these <UNK> hair <UNK> and it 's kind of freaking me out .
"i 've been listening for almost <#> years , but i 've never had the chance to see the guy live ."
"yeah , it 's easy to say the guy <UNK> ."
"i 've been playing guitar for <#> years and i 'm pretty good , but some of the stuff <UNK> was doing was downright <UNK> ."
i just got to the point where i figured i would n't try to understand it any more .
"step aside any <UNK> reasoning and just try to listen , man ."
"it 's <#> thing to listen to the guy on cd , it 's another thing to actually see him play ."
and then it 's whole other thing trying to put the <#> together .
"his fingers <UNK> across the <UNK> in a frenzy , <UNK> a <UNK> of notes ."
"yeah , i know that last sentence is cheesy as fuck , but it 's the only thing i could think of <UNK> ."
and i do n't want to get too heavy and <UNK> about watching him play and shit ...
"but then you 've got brain on drums , <UNK> and rapid fire . and house holding down the fort with the solid bass <UNK> ."
""" so we shall let the reader answer the question for himself ."
i 'm nothing but a stranger in this world ....
it 's been a while since i 've listened this extraordinary jazz <UNK> .
i had the urge to listen to him again after to talking with my cousin the other night .
i think all these <UNK> were made on the <UNK> label .
for some reason i was thinking they were on the <UNK> label .
"hell , it 's easy to get the <#> mixed up because they 've both been part of <UNK> for quite some time now ."
and then bill <UNK> hit the junk for a while as well .
"there 's <#> album cover , i forget which <#> , but you can actually see tracks on the dude 's arms ."
"for some reason , all this shit <UNK> me ."
i wish i could 've been in my <UNK> back then .
"anyhow , moving on with some more jazz stuff , i was doing some research on <UNK> lee morgan ."
i 'd heard rumors that he was shot by his woman while he was playing a gig ...
"then i found this ny times article that <UNK> it : new york times , feb ."
"she left , but returned a short while later ."
"the police said the argument was renewed , a shot was fired and mr ."
morgan fell to the floor with a bullet in his heart .
"miss more , whom the police said was mr ."
"morgan ’s common - law wife , was held without <UNK> for action by the grand jury ."
"spent a good portion of the day <UNK> through hunter s. thompson 's "" hell 's angels . """
just finished reading about some angels hanging out ken <UNK> 's crib .
hunter and <UNK> getting pulled over as they left <UNK> 's place .
but that 's just a small piece of the book .
some crazy fucking tales at the bass lake run and whatnot .
"anyhow , the angels have intrigued me since watching "" gimme shelter "" many years ago ."
i 've seen the flick at least <#> times since then .
i stopped reading it about half way through for some bizarre reason .
""" i 've tried to watch the flick and can never get through it ."
"i remember digging "" rum diary "" a few years back on a solo trip to europe ."
it feels like i have a grain of sand under my upper <UNK> since friday .
it hurts to blink and my eye keeps tearing up .
"from what i gather , these things usually clear up in a few days , or at least i hope so ."
"things could be worse , like <UNK> , which really fucks me up ."
but i have n't had to deal with that thanks to some stuff my cousin turned me on to
... it really rocks the <UNK> good clean <UNK> ...
"it 's been a while since i mentioned the holiday ... hell , a year or so"
"hell , i thought about writing a book about my experiences there ."
"anyway , somehow i started to this guy about the cameron <UNK> video that 's been floating around the net ."
i know it 's really fucking pathetic to admit to seeing the thing .
it 's even more pathetic to talk about it .
"but he was saying how he liked cameron and all , and i was surprised he did n't hear about the thing ."
"for those of you who have n't seen it , you 're not missing anything ."
so i stopped in a <UNK> on 12th and picked <#> of the black composition books .
lets just say it had to do with an ex - girlfriend .
"i 'm not going to get into details , because i plan to <UNK> what i wrote this weekend and really <UNK> on it ."
"but ya know , it really felt good to <UNK> in that fucking notebook ."
""" <UNK> "" by death in vegas on the headphones . and then looking at girls feet on the subway platform in between word <UNK> ."
<UNK> ' over the <UNK> ... ( photo taken last year )
"that 's <UNK> , <UNK> from behind the laptop ..."
<UNK> . and the true love of <UNK> 's .
"i have hundreds of books on my "" to be read "" <UNK> ."
"this is a <UNK> of the fabric for the set : i love my chair , <UNK> and the lamp !"
"thanks to the comfy chair and the reading lamp , i 'm reading a lot more these days ."
"hm , i think you can see <UNK> and her white <UNK> <UNK> from behind the chair ..."
i took this pic in pitch - black darkness and the result is brilliant .
best place to be during spring and autumn days .
"that is , when <UNK> is n't smoking his beloved <UNK> in front of me ."
he 's <UNK> <UNK> into a barking fit by <UNK> faces at her .
"do n't ask me why , but this was my very first sight of the <UNK> state capitol ever ..."
"the <UNK> window in our room at <UNK> bed and breakfast , in <UNK> , ma ."
it was taken through the windshield and it came out pretty good .
just had to get rid of pre - travel nerves ...
poor <UNK> <UNK> on the backyard deck in the <UNK> weather .
"yep , that 's <UNK> <UNK> next to my baby !"
nothing like a great book and great pasta for lunch at the mall after shopping .
"my sweet baby , miss <UNK> , enjoying the morning sun ."
"the pic was taken with the camera sitting on the floor , so she was looking at it , not at me or you !"
"an <UNK> - eating plant , in happier days ."
"the smallest , the <UNK> , and the sweetest of all ."
i enjoyed the feel of warm sun rays mixed in with <UNK> of cold air on my shoulders .
"then , <UNK> , i had to get up and go walk ."
"at least , it was a perfect walking weather ."
it 's a perfect place to be at early in the morning when it 's too chilly outside .
driving along the virginia <UNK> ... this building stands at the beginning of a village that is only <#> block long .
<UNK> <UNK> wine list in the <UNK> room while we wait for our table .
the drive back home the photo does n't do justice to the beauty of the <UNK> sunset back at home ... hope you all had a nice holiday !
hard to believe she 'll be <#> in january !
urllink this week 's challenge at urllink <UNK> ...
"urllink tiger and <UNK> love to lay on the <UNK> , however , <#> of them can only be on it or there 'll be a <UNK> ."
"but just for me , they <UNK> posed together for this <UNK> ."
"a second or <#> after this photo was snapped , <UNK> suddenly came out and i had to chase them off the <UNK> ."
urllink what a way to start the summer season ...
"urllink when i let <UNK> outside , she immediately captured a huge <UNK> that was <UNK> on our deck ."
"i never ever noticed the <UNK> , and i was so <UNK> that i made <UNK> release it from her mouth ."
"it was still alive but <UNK> hard in the sun , so i brought it out of the sun into the dark <UNK> ."
i started it last fall after receiving an order from a <UNK> wanting a cover for her halloween album .
"i was to finish it on december 1st , but i was <UNK> by injury and holiday plans and was n't able to finish it until now ."
"of course , the <UNK> is no longer interested in it ."
"i 'll probably put it up for sale at ebay in the end , but for now , i just want to hold on to it and enjoy it ."
urllink i have to sweep dead <UNK> off the front porch every morning before i can sit and relax with my book .
"urllink in case you ca n't figure out what the photo is about , that 's miss <UNK> covering her delicate nose with her <UNK> white <UNK> ."
"she always sleeps in this way , for some reason ."
urllink i collect <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dressed animals <UNK> .
"i prefer the <UNK> # <#> - <#> series , which were printed in the <#> 's and <#> 's ."
i first discovered these <UNK> while surfing on ebay back in january of <#> and immediately fell in love with them .
"by early last year , my collection of <#> <UNK> was complete ... except for the <UNK> <UNK> # <#> ."
"for some reason , the <UNK> <UNK> had never shown up on ebay , though the other series of the same <UNK> is not so rare ."
"to make sure , i emailed the <UNK> to see if the <UNK> was really printed in <UNK> and she assured me it was ."
i then won it via the last - second <UNK> .
"it arrived in the mail over the weekend , and now my collection is officially complete ."
urllink my sweet boy tiger grabbing some early - morning rays in the kitchen ...
"urllink ... and then my darling little girls , <UNK> and <UNK> enjoying the mid - morning <UNK> between clouds ."
"i also had no idea how to <UNK> of it properly , so i just stuck it in the <UNK> drawer ."
"it 'd been raining all day , and as <UNK> was about to arrive , there was a sudden <UNK> of sun ."
it was so bright that <#> could see it reflected on those leaves .
"urllink miss <UNK> "" helping "" daddy pack his stuff for his summer job ..."
urllink that 's where <UNK> will be working this summer .
it 's really a very pretty campus and all the buildings on it are <UNK> .
urllink at <UNK> 's aunt and uncle 's house .
"like <UNK> , <UNK> does not tolerate cameras very well ."
"urllink every monday , i 'll post a <UNK> ( work in progress ) photo of my current cross stitch project ."
"i go <#> , <#> , <#> days without touching it ."
"next goals : flowers , plants , <UNK> and <UNK> . here 's the model : urllink"
urllink <UNK> and i <UNK> sitting in the new <UNK> lounge .
"can we say , "" <UNK> ! "" now i gotta clean the <UNK> and dry it in the sun for a few hours ."
"well , <UNK> was stuck under the bed again this morning ."
i 'm aching all over from the <UNK> activity of <UNK> the king - sized bed yesterday .
<UNK> would be fine where he was ... it was n't that life - threatening .
"when the dishes were ready , i let the older <UNK> in ."
he managed to <UNK> himself all by himself .
urllink <UNK> almost scared me to death this morning !
i realized he was missing at feed time this morning .
"come to think of it , i did n't see him last night either when i went to bed !"
"i finally found him under <#> of the guest beds , totally stuck ."
i had to <UNK> the bed so i could release him .
poor baby ... he <UNK> for a long time and then <UNK> his food .
president reagan was the <#> who had the greatest impact on where i am today ...
"yet , i 'm very , very grateful for this <UNK> direction that led to my present happiness ."
urllink seeing those <UNK> like this <UNK> my heart in a <UNK> way because i know this moment is so fleeting .
"besides being elderly , between them they have <UNK> , <UNK> , diabetes , heart <UNK> and <UNK> ."
urllink birthday girl <UNK> urllink birthday boy <UNK>
"urllink this is <UNK> , an adorable <UNK> belonging to a <UNK> couple we are friends with ."
"so far , she 's doing all the stuff that i 've trained my own <UNK> not to do so ."
"sliding <UNK> under the <UNK> in a playful way is the worst ... apparently , <UNK> likes to "" bury "" her toys under the sheets ."
"oh my gosh , but she <UNK> at night ."
"she 'll be with us until august 16th ... so far , i 've had nothing but sleepless nights and endless fetch games every night ."
"because <UNK> and <UNK> , who are dominant types do not appreciate <UNK> , <UNK> has to stay in our bedroom behind a closed door ."
"urllink <UNK> 's sounds ( heart , lungs , etc . ) are still normal ."
but the vet did point out that her left <UNK> seems quite <UNK> from <UNK> .
"other than that , <UNK> is doing pretty good for her age ..."
urllink a <UNK> birthday card i got from my sister kathy .
"it has the things i love ... cats , books , <UNK> , etc ."
"there are <#> cats , which is what i have <UNK> ."
"being a "" tree - <UNK> "" , this is always a very <UNK> time for me ."
"however , being in a near - tropical climate , it 's a necessity if we want to keep ants and other <UNK> away from the house ."
urllink i took out the bow that the orange <UNK> was wearing in the model .
"why cross stitch <UNK> always put those ridiculous <UNK> on cats , i do n't know , but they do n't wear them in real life !"
"though the kit does n't ask for much <UNK> , you can tell from this photo that it badly needs it ."
"i 'm now working on the blue <UNK> , so will post another photo as soon as i finish it ."
"urllink today marks <#> whole years since we lost <UNK> 's sister , <UNK> ... <UNK> is sitting behind a <UNK> pillow ."
"it was given to <UNK> in <#> after his cat , samantha was put to sleep . like <UNK> and <UNK> , samantha was a <UNK> <UNK> ."
his grandmother was the <#> who <UNK> in <UNK> a love of these cats .
so <UNK> grew up with <#> pairs of <UNK> <UNK> .
"<UNK> was run over by a car at a very young age , and <UNK> lived to be about <#> years old ."
"though <UNK> has been gone since the <#> 's , the family still talks about him ."
"<UNK> <UNK> was put down at age <#> after she was bitten by some <UNK> , and samantha lived to <#> years old ."
urllink a while ago i read in a cross <UNK> forum about <UNK> mystery <UNK> .
"i rarely read mysteries anymore , but i was very , very intrigued by them ."
"so when <UNK> said he was heading to the library , i asked him to check out <#> of these books"
so i could see whether i 'll like it or not .
"well , he brought home the entire series ! !"
i have to admit they look really interesting .
"oh well , you know my plans for this week ! :-)"
* <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> on my deck lounge *
"always the very first in the kitchen at breakfast , i could n't interest her with her dish for a while ."
we 're expecting a hot and humid 4th of july holiday weekend !
"urllink on a hot and humid day like today , <UNK> likes to cool off on our glass coffee table in the living room ..."
urllink it contains the full <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> set .
"it was a steal at only $ <#> , rather than the $ <#> per <UNK> = $ <#> that the local <UNK> shop normally sells ."
"i ordered the set in a <UNK> fit after finding a great chart , only to find out i was out <#> colors ."
it 's <UNK> am going to the <UNK> ( and all trips <UNK> ) ! !
"no more messing around , it 's plan making time ! <UNK> ! ! !"
"<UNK> , where are you with all <UNK> , everything info ? ? ;)"
"ok , i 'm a <UNK> virgin and am <UNK> excited about the trip ! !"
"we 're good for the first <#> nights , but <UNK> will be arriving a needing a place to sleep ."
i have a tent that sleeps <#> ( but really <#> comfortably ) that i can bring if i need to .
love that you can edit somebody else 's post .
its a good time tonight come maybe with you and do n't believe there 's a light that 's brighter than the <#> that shine 's from you .
", you got to shine on shine on ."
"gotta shine on , shine on , yeah shine on , shine on ."
do n't worry about what 's on your mind .
"rob , this is why you need to be around ."
how the fuck did i forget about that ? ?
"<UNK> , it 's you and me night <UNK> tickets ."
"i 'm all by myself night <#> , but i will probably just lawn it then ."
"ok , so i stole it from urllink nerve 's weekend review ."
"i have no idea who this is , but he appears to have affection for his christmas tree and <UNK> ."
as i mentioned in my last post i slept on and off last night .
this is opposite of the high i was on about <#> hours ago when i met rick for lunch ( rick snapped the pic below .
a <UNK> like that is too good not to photograph ) .
i was all <UNK> and excitement . still <UNK> .
i also got the <UNK> tour of his law school .
i have a second interview for an admin job which also includes doing some print and web stuff .
"had a nap while watching lost in translation , but i chalk that up to being comfortable on the couch ."
i 'm asking everyone i know to cross they 're fingers and wish me well .
"so , around <#> am <UNK> send some good energy my way ."
i also need to find rick a present for sending this lead my way .
"something in the way of a dvd , <UNK> ?"
something <UNK> <UNK> with a post <UNK> <UNK> ?
in the meantime check out how a <UNK> <UNK> travels the globe : urllink <UNK>
i was wondering when i 'd get to the blood and guts ...
:) the painting i have delayed in starting - started .
made some movement on getting a grant for my urllink <UNK> .
"so , i decided to take the bike out for a spin ."
this is the bike that was given to me that rick has taken the time to tune up for me .
"now , i have n't been on a bike in prob <#> years and everything was fine ."
i got going w/ no <UNK> on balance or steering .
i hit a wall and recovered quickly mind you .
"it 's working well enough to type , obviously , but the skin on my <UNK> is hamburger ."
everything is fine until i actually take the time to look at the blood and cuts .
that 's when i got really <UNK> and sat down in my <UNK> .
got upstairs to wash the cuts and got <UNK> again and laid down on the floor in the apartment .
i 'm guessing this thing i have with looking at blood ( my own ) <UNK> that i wo n't be working in an emergency room anytime soon .
"anyway , i 'm <UNK> up and the delayed pain has started ."
""" i 'm happy to confirm the rumors ."
"urllink madonna will be going out on tour this spring and summer , "" her manager , <UNK> henry , said in a statement ."
"she 's goes on and i 've never actively sought out tickets , until now ."
then i can sit in the audience and scream like it 's <#> all over again .
i did a quick run to urllink design <UNK> at <UNK> and saw the featured flash site .
holy man : <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> : i am not going to scan a <UNK> .
: <UNK> me will not warm my ass up !
my excuse - i got friends that work for the evil empire and they have jobs where as i do n't .
you decide which product you would learn if you could get it for cheap .
another beautiful day in colorado - <#> days and counting without a job - is <#> going to be lucky for me ?
is it bad when the entire days ' worth of conversations are with your <#> month old son and you are still wondering exactly what he was saying ?
( please see the urllink <UNK> project if this makes no sense to you . )
originally the <UNK> part was going to be driven from the web but
"but where 's the challenge and besides i am building it and you 're not , so leave me alone ."
"urllink <UNK> is doing their best to help me accomplish this with their <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
i will let you know how this thing turns out .
if anyone has any good <UNK> that i should take a look at let me know .
might as well learn how to do this right the first time .
urllink <UNK> home <UNK> : <UNK> skills required for security <UNK> this article brings to point something that has bothered me off and on for awhile .

"hi big , yes as a matter of fact i have run into this in dealing with my own family 's care , i know"
this is hard to deal with a <UNK> in this manner and all i can offer you is this .
"do not waste your time <UNK> him , he is <UNK> to lazy and <UNK> to deal with the fact that <UNK> is real ."
"you may even want to research the <UNK> a bit , before you make a choice ."
i actually recieved a letter from a <UNK> at the center concerning <#> of the kids that i get in the mornings saying the same darn thing .
yes dealing with people <UNK> <UNK> can make us very angry
", i have been <UNK> with a few here for a while you just can not get through ."
i have learned they are just not <UNK> the argument .

<UNK> <UNK> pm | stephen <UNK> ] well today i was at dr .
<UNK> 's and managed to do some real good work with feeling accomplished .
also richard from the <UNK> took me to <UNK> street and broadway to try to get into the new course through the vancouver school board .
this is to complete the grade <#> math that i have to complete and it 's better to do this in a <UNK> setting .
things that are not right for me : <#> . i sometimes have difficulty with <UNK>
". <#> . i do have trouble with relationships that are close to me , <UNK> ."
<#> . i have trouble with working with people who are close to me <UNK> .
<#> . i have trouble with personal awareness many times .
i feel that i have to ask questions to feel at ease with others so that they will accept me and so that i will stay in their <UNK> .
<#> . taking risks is difficult for me sometimes .
"<#> . feeling comfortable with others has always been a <UNK> , and sometimes doing the basic requirements of life is difficult for me ."
<#> . sometimes i have trouble with procrastination with things that i do n't want to do .
<#> . <UNK> and future planning is a <UNK> for me .
"organizing is fine if i have the tools to do so , and time planning usually is the most difficult because it takes the most time to do ."
i have difficulty using the telephone correctly sometimes esp .
when it comes to personal <UNK> with family .
"i find myself being very able to handle a restricted lifestyle , but when it comes to a more <UNK> i tend to run into problems ."
"i find knowing and using skills that i have already quite enjoyable but learning new skills seem to take time developing , especially person to person skills ."
"i have to say to mom that , i need to claim my independence of family even though i am almost <#> years of age at the moment ."
"mom , you have done this yourself , and have continued to do this over time ."
i on the other hand have a non - grown child inside of me that is not fully a developed child .
so obviously i could not learn about this world since i was apart from it .
my difficulty now is that i need to know more about this world and understand more fully what this world means to me personally .
"inside my confidence has not grown in the world , since i was not in the world but kept apart from the world ."
"you , mom , have claimed your independence , and are a fully developed adult , and i need the chance to become <#> myself ."
i am just now comming to the point where i am comming out of the house emotionally as an <UNK> .
i can feel <UNK> and say that i feel <UNK> good that this time has come .
i now have to learn about the world around me much more than others who are already fully developed adults .
"yes , i have asked for help from you , mom , and asked you to be my coach , but you have to understand something ."
"a child does whine , and cry when they are not feeling safe and a teenager does go against the wishes of their parents ."
"i never really <UNK> , i never really stated my independence from you ."
"i feel that i need to claim this independence , and state my position and claim my <UNK> as every adult has done ."
i understand that nobody really <UNK> <UNK> most of the time but they do claim their space and their own area of personal development .
"this need for freedom , is very important for me ."
"i need to feel free enough to be able to state myself , and be free thinking . as well as this motion is very important to me ."
"i need to be able to get away from things physically , and <UNK> energy to this end ."
"i also need to have home as a place of rest and relaxation , and a place to get away from the world and escape into my own reality ."
"i ask for your help , and for ron 's , but i need this in <UNK> ."
the problem for me is figuring out what <UNK> is .
"what i need help with is finding out the middle ground , and the moderate ."
i tend to do the <UNK> thing whatever it may be .
"i tend to go beyond what is normal , and i do n't do enough of what is within the <UNK> of normal ."
"the idea here generally is that i need to be <UNK> , but in a way that is not so direct maybe ."
"i can never remember to get my blogs in on time , i keep forgetting about doing it !"
"i really want to be doing this on a daily basis , but life can be too <UNK> at times !"
"the house needs so much electrical work doing on it , i thought it best to try and make the task as safe as possible in future ."
"problem is , all the <UNK> you are n't legally allowed to change , were too short !"
never mind got round it in the end !
what a difference a bit of sunshine makes !
"temperature must be about <#> degrees , which in the scheme of things is really quite warm , giving that it has been <UNK> for the last few weeks ."
"anyway i have just kind of realised that blogging , potentially is a flawed medium - by this"
time to blog - why - why not - it seems to be the done thing of course !
but hey that s never stopped me before .
also found out today that my boys <UNK> operation has been delayed - what s the point of going private if the operation still gets delayed ? !
urllink information awareness office : how 's this for paranoid ? in <UNK> 's total information awareness system

"but if <UNK> off means more time for training yet no <UNK> for anything else , well just another <#> of lifes catch <#> 's ."
"things been a bit <UNK> for me <UNK> and kinda taken a back seat for the last few days trying to get my head <UNK> ,"
but alas i m back and ready and <UNK> to go .
wot was once a dream for me is going to be now a real adventure and for a good cause .
that s me done for now will add more after i ve calmed down a bit and get sorted ! ! !

"<UNK> huge thanks to dave my other half for that , when it comes to web design he s second to none :) ."
".... ... waited so long for you to come in my life , to save me , to see me , to simply understand me ."
only for the words that stumble from my mouth to be <UNK> attempts to rob your attention .
"to find us wrapped in the <UNK> of the passion that has yet to be experienced , awaiting for us to <UNK> into each others pleasures ."
revealed in time normally not to many things bother me .
because i chose to not let things bother me .
"normally , i jsut sit and ponder my thoughts about the things that <UNK> in me life ."
but anymore even my own <UNK> seem to be out of whack .
reality and illusion has seemed to have drawn a fine line in my life .
"seems everyone in my life has some sort of lie , some sort of thing they feel they need to hide from me ."
"or is everyone really out to get me , lol ."
"oh well , gonna try to not dig to deep in it ."
"as they say , everything is revealed in time . and the most important thing has been revealed to me today ."
new look okay this is the new look lol exciting huh .
new <UNK> find my self back on this journal today .
at least i know things here will be private .
"seems everyone around me is so full of shit anymore , just makes me sick ."
"i do nt get it . and its not for me to get , or i would get it ."
"ever sit back and think about things you have done in the past , feeling regret ."
"but thinkin about it today , i only realize there are things that i regret that i did nt do ."
i held back when i should had went for it .
i ran when i should had stayed and fought .
"if you run , you cry , if you stay and fight , and loose , you cry ."
"and if you win , and find out a few years later , there is no such thing as a happy ending , and you cry ."
"so , is it better to not have known happiness ? ?"
or is it better to have had it for a short time ? ?
is it better to sit here and day dream of what if ? ?
or is it better to sit here and morn the did have 's ? ?
old blog is at this link urllink <UNK> this is now my backup blog .
well my husband the geek is now trying to get his blog up and running .
he is working so people can comment on it .
<UNK> just got back from <UNK> yesterday afternoon .
i recommend it to anyone who has not gone .
i leave early tomorrow morning for my vacation to alabama .
movies i went to the movies last night .
we saw minority report and i thought that it was very good .
as i said we do not go to many movies because they are so expensive these days .
i highly <UNK> this movie if you want to see a good movie out now
my husband has set up another blog for me to post pictures of my niece .
i have not posted much but here is the link urllink <UNK> - <UNK> enjoy and feel free to comment
vacation well in <#> and half weeks we go on vacation .
we are going to alabama to see our family .
i will get to see my <#> yr old niece olivia for the first time since <UNK> of <#> she was not even <#> months old yet .
i know that she has grown quiet a bit .
arts blog and piercings well my husband now has his blog up and working .
it is urllink arts blog check it out see his new piercings .
well here i am posting on this blog again .
kind of a crazy story but the site that he uses is lost their <UNK> contract due to a <UNK> denial of service attack .
"how fun is that anyway , i think it is kind of messed up if you know what i mean ."
<UNK> is the alabama arkansas game check it out on your local cbs station
well here i am using blogger again to see if i like it as well as <UNK> type .
the only thing i can say right now is that i like the ability to post comments with <UNK> type and wonder if it can be done on blogger
as i have said before i also like <#> 's music and the urllink soundtrack is full of <#> 's music .
urllink art thinks that i am a nut job for liking <#> 's music .
urllink adam <UNK> is hysterical in this movie and so is urllink steve <UNK>
urllink <UNK> ( <#> ) i am sitting here changing the channel on tv and guess what is on <UNK> that s right <UNK> .
it is hard to believe that this movie came out <#> yrs ago .
anyway as i was looking on urllink <UNK>
i see that there is supposed to be a urllink <UNK> of this movie and it is from the producers of chicago .
nothing has been updated on <UNK> since last year about this .
speaking of <#> yrs ago it is hard to believe that urllink this show is <#> years old .
"anyway , as i was driving home from work this afternoon i decided that i would not leave the house once i got home"
but i really wanted a tomato sandwich but we had no bread and no tomatoes
so i went to <UNK> and bought bread and <#> tomatoes .
art thinks that a sandwich should have meat on it .
"anyway , who thinks that i am crazy because i wanted to eat a tomato sandwich for dinner ."
urllink king arthur ( <#> ) this movie looks like it might be pretty good .
"art and i do not pay to see many movies at the theatre , but king"
arthur looks like it might be worth going to a <UNK> sometime .
art and i went to see urllink this movie this afternoon .
i enjoyed it more than i thought that i would .
you learn quiet a bit about what happened after <#> .
if you are a supporter of president bush you may not like the film as it makes president bush look pretty bad .
art and i just started watching urllink this movie a few moments ago .
i have seen it numerous times but i just love urllink <UNK> cage .
urllink sean <UNK> is not bad looking either .
i was listening to a urllink local country station and urllink this song was playing .
it sounded remotely familiar so i came home and looked it up and to my surprise urllink john denver originally did this song .
well as soon as heard the tune i knew the name of the song and all the words .
it amazes me how i ca n't remember what i did <#> minutes ago
but i can remember lyrics to a song that was originally released <#> yrs ago .
no wonder art calls me the fountain of useless knowledge .
the version that i heard today was done by urllink billy dean .
i have never been <#> to like covers of older songs but i really liked billy dean 's version .
i know a geek that likes country music is not very common .
art and i rented urllink this movie the other night .
urllink johnny <UNK> makes a good pirate in the movie .
i remember when he was on urllink <#> jump street .
the show was <#> of the first to be on the urllink fox network .
well here i am wanting to rant about mt and how it gets <UNK> .
we have been unable to blog due to reasons that are being worked out as we speak .
it is hard to believe that june has come and gone so quickly .
we went to a <UNK> last weekend with art 's coworkers in port <UNK> il .
i met a few people who i had not before .
they all asked why he did n't have urllink his new toy with him .
i know i have said it before we are to <UNK> for our own good .
let me just start by saying that i am officially on vacation .
"i 'm not sure , but ask me in <#> weeks and if i have figured it out , i 'll let you know ."
"( by now you 're probably thinking "" what do you mean ' what * i * need to do ?"
"i 'm paying you to do things for me , not the other way around ! "" )"
"but if you fail to do a few things to make my job easier , we both get screwed ."
"believe it or not , we laugh , we cry , and most of us really care about our clients ."
"we make the best decisions we can based on the information that you give us , and on whatever evidence we get our hands on ."
":) <#> . when you hire an attorney , you are an <UNK> part of the attorney - client relationship ."
"tell me <UNK> the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth !"
"if i know the whole story , i can prepare for any scenario ."
your duty as a client is to <UNK> anything and everything that could affect the outcome of your case .
"<UNK> do not control how fast a case moves through the system , especially if it will definitely end up going to trial ."
"we can do our best to request trial dates and <UNK> , but we are ultimately at the mercy of the court <UNK> ."
your case is not the only case your attorney has .
your attorney has to work their <UNK> in <UNK> with what has been scheduled by the courts and what <UNK> are <UNK> .
"they will not touch your case every day , and they will not call you every day to give you an update ."
"that does n't mean they have n't looked at it at all , it just means that there is nothing new to report ."
please realize that your attorney is working for you and doing their best .
"calling your attorney once every <#> weeks to check the status is okay , but any more than that is n't necessary ."
"we have to pay our staff , our rent , your filing fees , our <UNK> and phone , etc ."
", and if you do n't pay your bills , we ca n't pay ours ... and we 'll most likely withdraw from your case ."
"hopefully , this little semi - rant will give you a little insight as to how you can make your experience with an attorney a positive <#> ."
"and , i 'll post more tips as they come to me , but right now it 's time for vacation ! ! ! !"
random <UNK> has moved to urllink <UNK> please update your <UNK> !
"well , the sun has just started to shine after a particularly heavy shower ."
i can see it <UNK> through drops of rain on the garden chairs outside the window .
"<UNK> the kitten is sat with his nose pressed up against the glass , and jess the dog is standing over him like a protective older brother ."
the top cat is <UNK> in the flower bed .
jan is <UNK> on her laptop and i can hear jamie playing upstairs with his friend sophie from up the road .
alicia has just been told to brush her hair so she is <UNK> upstairs .
"i think i shall save this , and maybe fire up <UNK> 's gate ii for a bit of hack and <UNK> ."
"it 's <UNK> it down with rain , it 's <UNK> , cold and gloomy ."
"sunday afternoon , and we 've just been out to see spiderman which has just been <UNK> to allow children under <#> to see it ."
"an excellent film , but the cinema was packed with <UNK> kids , <UNK> sweet <UNK> and talking during the quiet bits ."
it was more violent than i was expecting - hopefully some of the <UNK> will have been <UNK> and have nightmares tonight ... :-)
kitten news - <UNK> has <UNK> in the corner by the tv again .
"right , must go and get the washing in off the line and make sure that alicia has some school clothes <UNK> for tommorrow morning ."
"i have no sense of visual composition whatsoever , and i do n't think instruction will help ."
i did n't cry for <#> years <#> time .
"ever since i took it up again , it 's never been <UNK> or <UNK> or anything ."
it just makes me <UNK> and gives me a headache .
"i moved <#> times between <#> and <#> , mostly not because i wanted to ."
i do n't recommend it unless you already live in a tent .
being semi - <UNK> made it really hard to <UNK> and get settled in .
or maybe i 'll just give all my stuff away and go live in a tent with my cats .
not making that sarcastic comment when i feel it <UNK> up inside .
"i think this is related to # <#> , saying the right thing in quasi - romantic situations ."
"in any case , it 's <UNK> , and it 's gonna blow ."
early <#> ) had the best story about this ever .
i 'll get to that in a minute .
"first , let me <UNK> on his <UNK> ."
"eric was unbelievably hot , probably the only boyfriend of lisa 's i ever actually <UNK> ."
"he played <UNK> on <#> of those little plastic electric organs so beautifully , he actually made it sound like a musical instrument ."
"plus , he was apparently , er , gifted in other delightful areas ."
"i think he eventually turned into a freak and went away , but i do n't know the details ."
"the redneck cop says , ( picture the <UNK> )"
""" <UNK> goes through * mah * state that <UNK> - est . "" to which eric 's friend replies , "" <UNK> did . """
<#> . turning the other cheek when challenged directly .
"some aspects of my personality are a little , well , <UNK> ."
i <UNK> up a few folks when i was <UNK> president just because they invaded my territory and pissed me off .
<#> poor <UNK> from the business school ( <#> % of those who need a good chewing at <UNK> .
i 'm sorry to say i went alpha bitch on his ass .
"i 'm not proud of it , but he was belly - <UNK> submissive every time i saw him afterward ."
<#> . saying no in the face of <UNK> .
"i ca n't believe how many things i 've been <UNK> into by cheap <UNK> , even when i see right through it !"
"no , it 's not what you think ."
"so <UNK> , i like to touch everything ."
"i was at the <UNK> gardens today , and i could n't keep my <UNK> off the plants ."
"some of them were so <UNK> or <UNK> or strange , i just * had * to find out what they felt like ."
"and , hey , if there is anything around to pet , i 'm <UNK> ' it !"
"i frequently want to , but i almost never do it ."
"i 'm sorry , i ca n't get over all those <UNK> shoes !"
"remeber * why * we wore those <UNK> in the 70s , folks ?"
"that 's right , to hide those <UNK> bad shoes !"
"and i 'm not sticking my tv in an <UNK> , either -- it 's okay if people know i have a tv ."
"i 'm not growing my <UNK> out , so there !"
i do n't have the forehead for it and i 'm not going to have an addition built onto my forehead just so i can grow my <UNK> out .
"oh , and i hate the color <UNK> ."
"apparently , i 'm "" as bad as a man "" in this department ."
"when my environment is <UNK> , the system begins to break down and my <UNK> begins to show through the cracks in the <UNK> ."
"as many opportunities as i have had to learn this valuable skill , i 've blown them all ."
"i mean a "" <UNK> "" is just a <UNK> that cost more than <#> <UNK> , right ?"
"you 're still just going to put some dead plants in there and let them get <UNK> , yeah ?"
"it 's true , i 'm an insanely picky <UNK> ."
"also , many of the things i hate the most are really common , like <UNK> , tomatoes , and <UNK> ."
i could n't choke down a lovely <UNK> if my life <UNK> on it .
"i consider myself an "" active beauty "" ."
you never know what kind of goofy position i 'll be <UNK> in .
"you did n't think i got to be <#> - foot - <#> by waiting around for someone to make me a sandwich , did you ?"
"but i stopped eating meat ( okay , occasional seafood <UNK> ) before i started cooking for myself , so it 's a skill i 've never really acquired ."
i made <UNK> a turkey once when we were living in maryland being starving lovers .
"it grew a giant fat bubble under its <UNK> while it was cooking , and puzzled and <UNK> me before i called"
everyone i knew whom i suspected had ever cooked a turkey and <UNK> <UNK> .
"not movies , not <UNK> , just films ."
"i was <UNK> by being forced to sit through "" <UNK> and alexander "" as a child , and i have never been the same since ."
"i fear film may waste my time and my money and not entertain me , ever ."
"when i go to the movies , i like raw <UNK> : <UNK> , ridiculous <UNK> that test the "" <UNK> "" factor ."
"if i want heavy and slow and meaningful , i 'll go look at my own depressing life for free ."
anyone who has ever shaved her legs before going to the beach could tell you how effective a move that would have been .
"the cut - covered <UNK> - ee would almost certainly be <UNK> and screaming like a little girl in no time , but no ."
"no , just a little sand , no salt water ."
how come i have to have a relationship ?
how come nobody has <UNK> or love affairs anymore ?
i do n't want to talk about my feelings and communicate and behave like <UNK> quizzes are some source of wisdom .
", here 's lookin ' at you , kid ."
"of course , i 'm not a member of the wives union on account of i 'm more of a <UNK> than a <UNK> ."
although i am also pretty good at table repair .
"hey , maybe i can even come up with <#> of these ..."
"passing for half - whatever some of us who are odd ethnic <UNK> like to play a game called "" passing for half - whatever ."
"my friend mark is a <UNK> <UNK> of uncertain <UNK> ( he 's adopted ) , and he 's terrific at it ."
part of what 's fun about this game is of course that you get people to think about their own internal ethnic <UNK> systems .
"and then of course there 's the <UNK> factor , where you get to test the limits of human <UNK> . all in all , very entertaining ."
how anyone can mistake this blatantly <UNK> chin and <UNK> for anything else is a mystery to me .
mark kind of reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> ( <#> of my heroes ) and has also passed for having a number of exotic half - <UNK> .
but chuck recently knocked it out of the park when he got a bar full of people to buy that he was <UNK> .
i should probably begin by saying that chuck * might * be <#> pounds soaking wet .
"he 's sort of tall and <UNK> , with very long straight dark hair and dark eyes ."
"i would consider him attractive , and i 'm sure he gets hit on all the time when he 's behind the bar . if he were a dog"
", he 'd probably be something like a <UNK> , pretty and <UNK> with delicate feet and <UNK> ankles ."
"at the shop , he 's also my favorite <UNK> on "" i 'm not your <UNK> therapist , "" but that 's another story ."
let 's just say that being a bartender has made chuck a good listener .
"so anyway , chuck goes in to work and finds this old <UNK> behind the bar that says "" paul "" ."
"he whites out the "" l "" so it just says "" <UNK> "" and tells everyone in the bar he 's <UNK> . and they buy it ."
that beats the hell out of my half <UNK> .
i have a few high - profile talents that make it look like i 'm good at a lot of things .
"however , i want to assure those who keep asking me if there are things i 'm not good at that there are plenty !"
stuff i suck at in no particular order :
"<#> . <UNK> golf i like it , but i 'm lucky to break <#> ."
"<#> . anything <UNK> vertical depth perception ( basketball , volleyball , playing <UNK> , etc . ) seems to be <UNK> ."
"i look up , i have no idea how far away something is ."
"i can eventually beat it with excessive skill - specific practice , but i just do n't like volleyball that much ."
<#> . talking about my feelings ca n't i just have root canal instead ?
"i 'm interested in other people 's feelings , though ."
i 'm usually better off just looking at the logic of the equation and guessing .
rather re - invent the wheel than ask for a pump ... <#> .
saying the right thing in a quasi - romantic situation .
"me : man , do you have a shitty memory ."
"me : eh , what do you know ?"
i <UNK> my ankle in june attempting to skateboard for the first time .
"it was like the thing was equipped with an <UNK> system , <UNK> that i was over <#> and <UNK> me right off ."
"* looks * like i remembered that important meeting , and to go to ballet class , and your birthday , but i did n't ."
i wrote it down because i knew i would n't .
"no kidding , i 'm still <UNK> after all these years ."
<#> . being polite when i 'm trapped listening to a really annoying lecture .
"if i ca n't get away , the sarcasm is coming out ."
even the things i do for fun are just a different kind of work .
"i can sit there with the tv on , but i 'm usually happier if i 'm doing something else , too ."
"okay , i do n't really suck at this anymore , but i have no natural <UNK> for it either ."
i can do it because i work really hard at it .
look for my <UNK> rant in a later posting ... <#> .
"doing <UNK> things with <UNK> girlfriends i did n't start having real girlfriends until late in life , and in a pack , i 'm still <UNK> by them ."
"i 'm still not down with jewelry shopping , but i can be talked into girls ' night out ."
"an <UNK> is a system , not a collection of parts ."
and you must <UNK> the system ( or break it ) .
"their only crime was ignorance , but i just ca n't leave these <UNK> alone ."
it 's <#> thing to be ignorant but willing to learn .
"but it 's something completely else to be reasonably intelligent , ignorant , and want to stay that way ."
", i feel a <UNK> coming on : ignorance is bliss ."
"you do n't know , do n't want to know ."
"oh yes , even the <UNK> , <UNK> kind ."
i ca n't tell you how many times this <#> has gotten me into trouble .
"<UNK> , <UNK> from buses , playground battles , having security called on me , court appearances ... as a small child in daycare"
"i was the only <#> with the <UNK> to do it , but the fact that every adult in the room froze was pretty satisfying ."
"ah , it 's that time of year again ."
i had just become the president of the graduate student association .
i found out a couple of days before <UNK> that i was expected to throw on some academic <UNK> and give a speech to the whole freakin ' university .
i was starting to get that what have i done feeling .
"this year , i 'm the vice president of that organization , after an <UNK> <#> years as president ( and <#> the year before that as <UNK> ) ."
"i 'm enjoying watching someone else in the role do it differently from the way i did it , and i 'm trying to be available for questions ."
"i was hoping i was non - control - freaky enough to sit back and enjoy , and so far , so good ."
"in <UNK> , i could n't really have made the organization any worse off , and once i realized that , it was pretty <UNK> ."
"i think i made some positive contributions to the university community , and i may be able to make a few more before i graduate ."
"<UNK> speech , october <#> , <#> when i was in third grade"
", my teacher asked my class how old we would be in the year <#> ."
"although i was <UNK> at the outcome of my figuring , i was soon relieved ."
i would never be * that * old .
"now , as i contemplate the many <UNK> birthdays still ahead of me , i can safely say that the future is what we make it ."
"this year , i have <UNK> a strong and <UNK> organization : <#> that <UNK> meets its long - term goals despite annual changes in leadership and membership ."
<#> good example is that the graduate student association council now <UNK> and funds <UNK> organizations as part of its ongoing commitment to building community among graduate students .
"perhaps "" <#> can never step in the same stream twice , "" but certainly the stream <UNK> patterns and characteristics that make it <UNK> ."
i think about how george <UNK> first demonstrated video <UNK> .
we are already looking at the future and participating in <UNK> it on a daily basis .
"i urge you to take advantage of this exciting stage of community construction , to talk to each other , to begin sharing ideas and <UNK> ."
only in participating in what we <UNK> imagine do we create our collective future .
well now its the next day and my head is hurting ! argh !
<UNK> medicine is n't helping so this really sux .
well i am just starting to <UNK> with this <UNK> thing .
gotta go since my oldest needs to use the <UNK> .
i have n't been on here in like forever <UNK> !
25th . my oldest will be <#> on april <UNK> .
my lil <#> will be <#> on june 5th .
god i wish all the work from home ads were n't <UNK> .
i 'd love to have some extra money that is just mine .
urllink <UNK> # <#> ohh i 'm bored no <#> to talk too <UNK>
but i trashed it since someone <UNK> me and was rude .
urllink <UNK> - shops and <UNK> i love <UNK> lol !
"urllink the weather <UNK> : <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> airport : "" urllink """
can i tell you about the kitchen nazis at my job ?
"first of all , we have an <UNK> , extra - fabulous cafeteria , better than the <UNK> ones ."
"we 've got a grill , a <UNK> , pizza section , and hot ( home cooked style ) food section ."
"technically , they close at 3:00 , but the <UNK> have taken over the schedule ."
sort of like black folks working in retail .
"within <#> minutes , it 's <UNK> time ... bring yo shit to da <UNK> !"
today only to find that all the <UNK> have been broken down .
we got <UNK> <UNK> the grill and <UNK> <UNK> wrapping all the <UNK> .
"how could they get away with that . obviously because of the holiday , the <UNK> ."
they were all looking at me as if they were wondering why this big <UNK> gal got an attitude .
you 'd have <#> too if you got all the shit carried out of you on <UNK> friday .
so i 'm forced to settle for this <UNK> little lunch .
"my stomach hurts , my <UNK> is low , and if i pass out here i 'm gonna go and slap the chef 's hat <UNK> <UNK> 's ass ."
"please send all food <UNK> to : <UNK> bitch <#> potato chip way <UNK> , idaho <#> anything help is greatly appreciated ."
i was only taken to the urllink gate once and could not return .
"why was it that everytime i thought i was going in the right direction , i ended up at a dead end ?"
seemed like i got dropped off and left with nothing to show me the way .
if only i 'd left popcorn behind the first time i went .
the first time at the gate last night was amazing .
"i wanted to stay forever , but was asked to leave by the head of the urllink turtle department ."
my <UNK> was a direct result of my behavior the past few weeks .
turns out the rest of the <UNK> did not appreciate how i handled my time .
i did n't get enough sleep in and i did n't follow through on what i promised .
my penalty was <#> entrance to the gate and i do n't ever want that to happen again .
i wonder if i can file a complaint against the turtle department .
tell them i was treated <UNK> and that just because i did n't rest should not mean restricted access !
i took my <UNK> urllink school shopping last night .
it amazed me to see kids running about getting things for the new school year .
i was <UNK> with satisfaction by merely the look in the boy 's eyes as we filled the cart with cool school stuff .
i remember when i was a kid and did n't have the <UNK> of your typical elementary school aged child .
"my brother and i were forced to wear used clothes , <UNK> tough <UNK> , and packed <UNK> containing grilled cheese and tuna sandwiches ."
i do n't know what was wrong with my mom back then .
"she had this <UNK> with putting <UNK> <UNK> in our <UNK> , which meant being the center of attention at lunch because kids would clown us ."
because everything a child does has something to do with running and jumping .
"well , i 'd run and jump with my little <UNK> urllink holly hobby <UNK> in tow ."
so kids looked forward to <UNK> just to see my lunch explode .
"it was n't that she was "" on "" anything , she did the best"
she could so her lil <UNK> could eat .
the only thing was she just did n't understand that <UNK> <UNK> .
she never said she was a <UNK> so i 'm not bitter .
stumbled across these lyrics by urllink alice in chains .
i really need to pay more attention to what i agree to .
"work from <#> - <#> , which ran an hour late ."
i was invited to go to kayla 's new schools fall <UNK> carnival .
kayla is my <#> year old neighbor and she is just <#> of the cutest kids .
"her brother , john , will be <#> in january ."
"i am lucky enough that their parents , tina and pete , let me play with them ."
we moved here when he was only a couple of weeks old and it has been a blast watching them both grow and change .
i view it as my duty to make sure that little boys know it is bad to make her cry :o ) .
i had a great time with kayla and john and the carnival .
she was running around telling kids and their parents that i was her friend and
she always makes me feel like a hero .
"so i came home , changed <UNK> , and was off to my <UNK> school 's halloween party ."
standard greeting is a hug and kiss on the cheek .
ca n't help but feeling at home with this group .
i started <UNK> about <#> weeks ago now .
"good exercise , good fun , and i get to beat people up twice a week ."
i did n't get back to the house again until 11:00 so i decided to stay home .
i had wanted to go to my friend <UNK> 's <UNK> party .
his parties are always great with a <UNK> mix of people .
just going to people watch is a blast .
i just was n't in the mood to haul my cookies up to <UNK> city for it .
this afternoon i helped tina get party <UNK> and such made up for kayla 's <UNK> party tomorrow afternoon .
i had blown <#> hours before i knew it .
it is nice having another chick around to <UNK> with .
"i can play with hers , have all the fun , and no need to be having my own yet :o ) ."
tomorrow i will probably go over and help finish the <UNK> and help with the party .
looks like she will have around <#> kids !
never had stuff that cool when i was a kid .
"then again , everything kids have now is a lot cooler than what i remember there being ."
i will try to get better at writing and keep pretty regular updates .
a few months ago i crashed at <UNK> .
at the time it appeared all i had done was get a small <UNK> and <UNK> my left arm a bit .
"well , the shoulder never stopped bugging me and all the <UNK> and <UNK> in the world was n't helping ."
when i started <UNK> a few weeks ago it really started bugging me .
i finally broke down and saw an <UNK> doctor .
"her solution , <#> weeks of physical therapy twice a week and some heavy duty anti - <UNK> drugs ."
"my thoughts on the whole thing , <UNK> ."
i went to my first pt appointment yesterday having no idea what to expect .
he did some tests to <UNK> exactly where the injury was and decide what to do about it .
then he came back with a big book full of excellent <UNK> of everything under your skin .
turns out i have damaged a <UNK> that is part of a <UNK> of muscles and <UNK> that make up the <UNK> <UNK> around your shoulder .
"do n't ask me the name , i ca n't remember ."
it goes <UNK> bones and <UNK> an exact fit .
if it <UNK> up due to injury then <UNK> !
i am thinking i am going to have to do a mess of boring exercises and all .
they put <#> types of warm <UNK> all over my shoulder and then do this heated ultra sound thing .
"then they top it off with a few minutes of the worlds largest , <UNK> ice pack ."
going by the restrictions they gave me i may as well just tie the arm off .
no lifting anything over a pound or <#> with my left arm .
he also did n't say i had to stop <UNK> .
"of course , i did n't exactly ask either ."
"classic case of "" do n't ask , do n't tell "" ."
mark has managed to come down with a wicked little cold .
i think the sudden weather change caught him .
"his band , <UNK> <UNK> , ( <UNK> ) will be playing their first public show november <#> ."
he plays so well and he has so much fun .
i had a whole thing written here and i clicked the wrong button .
mark and i had both forgotten to get candy all week
and so we both ran in a grabbed a bunch on the way home form work .
we ended up with some <#> or <#> bags of candy .
mark was looking around at the neighbors and decided we had to do something or we would be lame .
we grabbed <#> of the <UNK> 's that was in a state of <UNK> and laid it down on the lawn .
then we stuck a light under it to give it that <UNK> bike wreck look .
the we tossed the <UNK> from the bike around the lawn .
the candy was put in this huge bucket we use to put <UNK> on ice in and we had so much it was filled half way up .
"i put a big sign on the bucket that said "" candy "" and put the bucket towards the top of the bike wreck ."
mark dug out his messed up <UNK> and his messed up helmet from his big crash at <UNK> and put it all on .
i took some red food dye and we <UNK> it on his <UNK> like blood so he looked pretty gross .
then he went and laid on the lawn with his head near the bucket .
even the adults were n't sure or were positive it was a stuffed <UNK> !
"mark spent the evening laying on the lawn and making boys and girls , young and old scream ."
we managed to give away almost all of that candy and he had a blast .
tomorrow night is the big night for <UNK> <UNK> .
so i am gonna have to take a nap saturday afternoon or i will end up falling asleep during the show .
we will be out well past my bed time .
plus i am pretty sore from <UNK> class .
i got to <UNK> for the first time wednesday night .
it is a <UNK> thing and a lot of fun .
you could tell by all the hair on the mat from everyone in the class .
i feel like a giant <UNK> factory with no temperature control on the <UNK> .
just what is up with the cough that <UNK> this years flavor of flu ?
"they 've been together less than a year , but more than <#> months ."
since getting together with <UNK> <UNK> mark has <UNK> a great deal more instruments and built a very cool digital studio in <#> of the rooms of the house .
he 's even been making some original tunes that sound really good !
"if you are in the san jose area mark saturday , november 2nd , on your <UNK> ."
"<UNK> <UNK> will be performing live and in public at the fifth quarter , <#> <UNK> , san jose , at <UNK> ."
up until now they have only been doing private parties .
whenever someone i know travels <UNK> 's i always ask them to steal me something .
the rules are that it can not be purchased and must have country or city name on it .
i have gotten some fascinating things this way .
i have a whole collection of ill gotten booty from around the world .
my most recent was a really neat bottle <UNK> from the <UNK> hotel in india .
"the thief broke the must not purchase rule and also brought me home some beautiful silver <UNK> from the market in <UNK> , india ."
it is beautiful and it feels good to know i am thought of .
"they moved the entire it group , ( all <#> of us ) , into another area this week ."
instead of having a real cube with real walls i am now stuck in a <UNK> .
"it is a "" think tank "" <UNK> ."
"you know , te <UNK> that makes sure everybody is in your business ."
i spend my whole day with my phone <UNK> over <#> ear and my finger in the other .
"no walls , means everybody gets to hear everyone else 's conversations . whether we want to or not ."
"woke up late , laid around , showered , and then went across the street to help <UNK> for kayla 's halloween party ."
came home for a bit and made some <UNK> for mark and i was back to the neighbors to help out with the party .
"i know that a great deal of food was eaten , drinks were drank , and fun was had by all ."
we put tons of <UNK> temporary stick on tattoo 's on loads of kids .
a spiderman <UNK> was broken and children dove for candy and <UNK> .
i put blue and red stripes in kayla 's hair and she looked great !
"i am home now , with a load of junk food , and very tired ."
"he has a horrible cough that is keeping both of us up at night , a miserable headache , and is producing enough <UNK> to fill a <UNK> ."
he was supposed to go to rehearsal today but could n't make it .
i really hate it when he 's sick .
i always feel so inadequate because there is so little i can do about it .
the good news is that i have n't got whatever he has yet .
usually i manage to come down with everything he gets in no time flat .
i may actually beat it this time though .
i am getting tired of sharing diseases with him .
"so , due to families deciding to get married and travel great <UNK> and such mark and i will be staying home for thanksgiving ."
since we decided to stay home but still wanted a huge turkey dinner we are having <#> :o ) .
this year we have invited a few friends over and i am gonna cook a huge amount of food .
then we are going to live on left <UNK> for the next week or <#> .
<UNK> and turkey will be the key words for the day !
speaking of cousins weddings i am just about to be the last hold out among us .
i remember when i thought my oldest cousins were gods and then when i thought they were just <UNK> .
they are so much older than me they 've always been the big kids .
"of course , that made me the <UNK> tag along cousin . playing with me"
wa s a <UNK> you had to do at holiday <UNK> .
i ca n't remember them ever being mean to me . except for that whole glow in the dark <UNK> under the bed thing .
to this day i get the <UNK> walking in a dark room with a bed in it .
"the more i do my job , the more i hate it ."
i am truly sick of people who lack the common sense nature gave a <UNK> and insist that you know nothing .
well if you know so <UNK> ' much why are you calling me to fix your friggin ' problem ? ! ?
"oh , and why is english so friggin ' hard to speak ? ! ?"
"<UNK> , i spend half my day trying not to make a cultural <UNK> <UNK> with some of the end users ."
we behave according to your ways in your country .
what 's so damn hard about dealing with our ways in our country ?
i spend my whole day whispering and trying to look busy when i have nothing to do .
i have cleaned and <UNK> my space more times than i can count .
you hear everything in here and everyone else hears everything you are up to .
if a fly <UNK> we all hear it .
i am at a point where i will cry tears of joy when i lose this job .
"make no mistake , i will lose this job ."
it 's only a matter of time before they have more lay off 's and i am only <#> of <#> people left from the contract company they use .
they have decided to no longer supply cell phones to end users which <UNK> <#> more thing i was in charge of .
we do n't order any parts or pc 's anymore
i am also in direct line of sight of the director of <UNK> .
so i am forced to look terribly busy even when it is painfully slow .
i knew my days here were <UNK> as soon as they moved our butts into this friggin ' <UNK> .
it 's <#> thing to know people are keeping an eye on you .
"to feel the hot breath of the "" your position is being <UNK> "" dragon every day , every hour , is just wrong ."
having a crappy job i can deal with .
not having a job at all i can deal with .
waiting to not have a job is just too much .
many of our friends showed up and we packed the bar .
the bar owner was very pleased and everyone thought the band was great .
it was great to see so many of our friends and to know
we are thought well enough of to have their support .
i will get mark to write up a little report and post it here .
"i know , i know . i have been <UNK> my blog for a few days ."
i promise to sit down and update this thing for the few people who actually read it this week .
there just has n't been <UNK> to say and a whole lot to do .
today i drug my butt out of bed at <UNK> and went to take my test for my yellow belt .
did a little checking and i can get both classes i need online for my <#> <UNK> degree 's .
registration was sent this week for economics at <UNK> college and business communications at <UNK> college .
so by summer i will be a college graduate .
then i can complete my computer science <UNK> and transfer to a university for a <UNK> degree in that .
let 's just hope it does n't take as long as my <UNK> .
i try to do all my classes online now thru the distance learning offered .
"i get much better grades when attendance is n't required and i can do things my way , on my time , and my learning style ."
i never have done well with the standard way of education .
ca n't sit still for it and all that damn group interaction crap annoys me .
most people seem to run at a slower speed and less organized fashion than i do .
forced group <UNK> piss me off and i tend to fight them to my <UNK> .
"if i want to interact , i will ."
"if i do n't want to and you make me , everyone around me pays ."
i tend to make everyone around me as miserable as i am .
not a good idea but i ca n't seem to stop myself .
i expect <#> day i will <UNK> this but at almost <#> years old i doubt it .
last night i did a practice test for my <UNK> .
i am not real comfortable being watched yet when i <UNK> .
i got brave and asked mark to come to my test anyway .

the <UNK> body of canada 's <UNK> church is meeting to discuss the highly <UNK> issue of same - sex blessings ...
"bishop john <UNK> <UNK> , head of the <UNK> <UNK> of washington , was to <UNK> bless the relationship of a gay priest and his partner saturday ..."
do n't miss the june <#> edition of the advocate !
on page <#> is a brief story ( with photo ) of bishop <UNK> charles and <UNK> paris ' wedding .
"on may <#> , <#> <UNK> robin <UNK> of ireland spoke to the annual dinner of the church club of new york ."
"before his address , he met with <UNK> <UNK> director jan <UNK> , staff writer matthew <UNK> , and <UNK> of new york communications director neva <UNK> fox ."
the following is an edited <UNK> of their conversation ...
"a conservative <UNK> group will protest a same - sex "" wedding "" taking place today on church property in the rural community of <UNK> in st ."
"as <UNK> prepare to gather for their general assembly in richmond , va ."
", next month , a band of determined conservatives is <UNK> a plan to split the church along liberal and <UNK> lines ."
"another divorce proposal shook the united <UNK> convention in pittsburgh earlier this month , while conservative <UNK> have already broken away to form a <UNK> network of their own ..."
"may <#> , <#> a response to the <UNK> <UNK> board i appreciate your letter and the clarity it <UNK> to ."
let me take the categories that you raise and respond .
"when the headline of the san francisco <UNK> states , “ <#> year old <UNK> <UNK> same - sex partner , ”"
i either have to embrace that as a fact on the ground or distance myself and the <UNK> of california from the <UNK> .
mayor <UNK> took a <UNK> strike approach to <UNK> civil marriage .
"were i to embrace the <UNK> of bishop <UNK> marriage , i would be doing the same thing in <UNK> terms ."
i would be saying that the final <UNK> of the constitution and <UNK> and general convention is <UNK> charles .
"this matter has many <UNK> , but the essential <#> for me has to do with the <UNK> ."
"people who are gay or lesbian are <UNK> to the <UNK> or <UNK> regularly , and the <UNK> church hardly notices ."
"but when gene robinson is <UNK> as bishop of new <UNK> , the <UNK> of the <UNK> communion shake ."
"when a bishop takes a bold step , it needs to be well thought out , authentic , and the author needs to be aware of the consequences ."
"as long as <UNK> charles is an <UNK> bishop of the <UNK> of california , any bold thing he does , i do ."
he represents me and represents all of the people of the <UNK> of california .
"if this <UNK> - old <UNK> <UNK> , it appears that i have <UNK> the marriage of a bishop outside the authority of the <UNK> church ."
then i position this <UNK> and myself to be in the path of all the <UNK> that follows and myself to be <UNK> <UNK> by the church .
either i embrace his “ marriage ” or distance myself from it .
surely you realize that the <UNK> church has not <UNK> same - sex marriages of <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> .
i wasn’t sending any signal to the <UNK> of this <UNK> about our <UNK> .
this was entirely and only a bishop - to - bishop matter for me .
"obviously there are <UNK> , but the central matter is between a <UNK> and an <UNK> bishop ."
i wrote an anti - drug statement to the <UNK> to distance myself from his position .
"second , when i was asked , i told donald <UNK> that <UNK> could have a celebration of his relationship with <UNK> with <#> conditions ."
"by no means was it going to be called a “ marriage , ” and <UNK> was supposed to stay away from the press ."
i didn’t want him to use this moment to send <UNK> messages and/or to create a celebrity status for himself .
i just wanted him to gather with his friends and loved ones for a blessing and celebration .
"when i picked up the newspaper and read about his “ marriage ” and his comments to the press , i felt deeply betrayed ."
also it made me feel that i had betrayed the people of the <UNK> of california by <UNK> <UNK> charles .
it turns out that there was a critical moment .
bishop charles had been approached by the press for an interview .
"at that moment he could have <UNK> me out of courtesy , <UNK> , respect ."
but he chose to call a public relations expert instead .
to be dismissed by an <UNK> bishop as having no <UNK> <UNK> regarding the most <UNK> church issue of our generation is a gesture that hits its mark <UNK> .
this did not seem to be the way an <UNK> bishop should relate to a <UNK> bishop .
( <#> ) public relations you write that it was “ a public relations <UNK> . . .
"once a bishop of this <UNK> “ <UNK> ” in the newspapers , the mess begins ."
but this is the reality that was set in motion with <UNK> from his public relations expert .
"( <UNK> versus official policies concerning same - sex couples up to now , i think it has been important not to have a <UNK> policy ."
"the <UNK> of new <UNK> ( vancouver ) carefully adopted a policy a few years ago , and all hell broke loose ."
a great deal of the energy and resources of that <UNK> have since been used up in dealing with the <UNK> of having an official policy .
also the former bishop of kansas adopted an official policy for the <UNK> and quickly retired .
that <UNK> is still digging itself out from that action .
at the last general convention we voted in such a way as to make official policies acceptable .
<#> of the things it means is that every <UNK> is now free from having <UNK> conflicts over this matter or threats of discipline .
"if the <UNK> of the <UNK> of california would appreciate an official policy , i would be glad to call together a group to work on the details ."
"or if you would prefer guidelines , i would be glad to elaborate on the ones now in place ."
at <UNK> conference i will give everyone an opportunity to be heard .
i take exception to <#> point in your open letter .
at no time have i <UNK> to make same - sex blessings a “ dirty little secret .
” <#> of our same - sex blessings was carried <UNK> on abc “ turning point ”
what i have worried about is the possibility of <UNK> when the culture of the blessings services would be <UNK> rather than sacred .
<#> of my items was left out of the present guidelines .
i have always insisted that the couples have proper counseling prior to their commitment .
i am deeply sorry that oasis is not aware of that .
( <#> ) shame you would want me to feel shame because of what has happened . “ a little more shame .
sometimes people you trust prove not to be <UNK> .
i don’t intend for us to be a people of shame .
i am convinced that the day will come when the whole family of faith will honor in the best way the authentic relationships of love wherever they spring up .
"<UNK> in christ , the <UNK> . <UNK> ."
"only <#> days before our meeting , the right of same - sex couples to obtain marriage <UNK> had become legal ."
hundreds of people were responding to this unique opportunity and were already in the process of seeking the blessings of <UNK> .
"for those of us within the <UNK> church , however , there was a serious issue of <UNK> to the <UNK> which bind us into community ."
the <UNK> of massachusetts had asked its <UNK> to refrain from performing such marriages in keeping with the national <UNK> of the church .
"thus , we were in the midst of a time of both intense celebration and of equally intense controversy ."
"like all <UNK> , we were in the tension between matters of conscience and questions of community ."
"in short , we were in a time of need for <UNK> ."
our first response was <#> of deep prayer and deep listening .
"we invited men and women from our faculty , students , staff , and <UNK> to join us for dialogue and <UNK> ."
we heard the voices of our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters for whom this is a <UNK> personal concern .
"we heard the thoughtful opinions of ethical , theological , and <UNK> positions that <UNK> the <UNK> of justice on this issue ."
we prayed for the guidance of the holy spirit in making our shared response .
"we <UNK> the statement of our president and dean , the <UNK> ."
"john 's chapel will not be available for opposite - sex , <UNK> marriages until further notice ."
<#> . we recognize and will honor other christian traditions that do permit same - sex marriages .
we invite the <UNK> of massachusetts to join us in an <UNK> dialogue to consider options for justice in support of <UNK> persons .
"in conclusion , we know that our decisions will not please everyone ."
we accept that reality as a <UNK> to any meaningful effort at <UNK> .
"for the sake of that love , give us the gifts of your justice , your compassion and your <UNK> as we work together to build your faithful community ."
for it is in you that we trust and in your holy name that we pray .
"may <#> , <#> ny times op ed <UNK> day by andrew sullivan <UNK> today is the day that gay citizens in this country cross a <UNK> of equality ."
gay couples will be married in massachusetts - their love and commitment and responsibility fully <UNK> for the first time by the society they belong to .
the long march of african - americans to civil equality was and is deeply different from the experience and legacy of gay americans .
"marriage , after all , is perhaps the chief mechanism for <UNK> new families into old ones ."
"the ceremony is a <UNK> ritual , <#> in which peers and grandparents meet , best friends and distant relatives <UNK> ."
it 's hard for <UNK> to imagine being denied this moment .
"it is , after all , <UNK> in our civil religion as the "" happiest day of your life . """
and that is why the denial of such a moment to gay family members is so <UNK> and cruel .
it <UNK> people from their own families ; it builds an invisible but <UNK> wall between them and the people they love and need .
you might think from some of the discussion of marriage rights for same - sex couples that homosexuals emerge fully grown from under a <UNK> bush in san francisco .
we are born into families across the country in every shape and form <UNK> .
i remember the moment i figured out i was gay .
i would never have a relationship as valid as my parents ' or my brother 's or my sister 's .
"it 's hard to describe what this realization does to a young psyche , but it is profound ."
"you recover , of course , and move on ."
"but even when your family and friends embrace you , there is still the sense of being "" separate but equal . """
and this is why the images from massachusetts today will strike such a <UNK> .
"for by <UNK> on nothing more nor less than marriage , the massachusetts supreme <UNK> court has <UNK> that invisible wall that <UNK> families within themselves ."
this is an <UNK> of the deepest kind .
that is why the term gay marriage is a <UNK> .
"today is not the day "" gay marriage "" arrives in america ."
today is the first time that civil marriage has stopped <UNK> homosexual members of our own families .
what these couples are <UNK> is not something new ; it is as old as humanity itself .
"what has ended - in <#> state , at least - is <UNK> ."
we have taken a step toward making homosexuality a non - issue ; toward making gay citizens merely and <UNK> citizens .
this is why i am so surprised by the resistance of many conservatives to this reform .
"it is the most pro - family measure <UNK> - keeping families together , building new ones , <UNK> the ties between generations ."
"and it is a profound <UNK> to identity politics of a <UNK> kind , to the <UNK> that <UNK> our society into categories of gender and color and faith ."
"this is why some elements of the old left once opposed such a measure , after all ."
"how much more striking , then , that the left has been able to shed its <UNK> more successfully than the right ."
"conservatives , with the president chief among them , have said to these people that they are beneath the dignity of equality and the promises of american life ."
they alone are beneath the fold of family . but
"this time , these couples have said yes - and all the president can do ( today , at least ) is watch ."
it is a private moment and a public <#> .
"it is <UNK> made real , a love finally come home : after centuries of pain and <UNK> , the "" happiest day of our lives . """

i completely understand the logic of the <UNK> in this <UNK> in their decision .
the national <UNK> are clear in defining marriage as being between a man and a woman .
"and , <#> might rush to say that the prayer book is also clear ."
i think this is the <UNK> which <UNK> national <UNK> .
i want to stress the <UNK> nature of this <UNK> development .
i do not wish to create a situation of <UNK> which insists that the living waters of our faith be <UNK> from separate but equal <UNK> .

thank goodness mary said yes to god before the church could define the theology of the <UNK> or develop a <UNK> sound <UNK> of baptism !

what is it that god is calling us to do ?
"in the midst of this <UNK> moment in the church , what is god 's dream for this <UNK> and the role it will play in the church ?"
"at least , that 's what i learned here as a <UNK> ."
"and , i trust , this <UNK> response remains the primary lesson that this <UNK> teaches - by word and deed and example ."
gay <UNK> was the <UNK> horse <UNK> - we got <UNK> and it cost us blessings .

"when i left at <UNK> pm , <UNK> stood up and said he was hearing <#> options <#> ."
declare the chapel a <UNK> and open it for all weddings .

there was a good vibe in the room about that when i left .
my take is that ai n't nothing gonna happen like that at general convention .
bottom line : it 's a <UNK> from the <UNK> to <UNK> .
it would be wonderful if some of you might find the time to call and/or email him and give him your support .

the limits of <UNK> are <UNK> by the <UNK> of those whom they <UNK> .
the issue is the unity of all humanity <UNK> by god in the life and work of christ .
baptism is the <UNK> of that unity of all human life in god .
it 's particularly good to see <UNK> publishing this piece .

matthew <UNK> – now those are good old biblical family values !
remember that these holy <UNK> we treasure as part of our spiritual <UNK> have never offered a quick fix -- an easy answer –
and what is the teaching jesus offered them – and us – in this text from matthew ?
well “ peace at the price of justice ” doesn’t seem to be on the list .
rather it ’s about the cost of <UNK> – the task of truth telling – the hard work of coming out … as a christian .
christian values have gotten a very bad rap .
those my brothers and sisters are the biblical values we <UNK> – celebrate – are called to <UNK> .
priorities as clear as these final words jesus sends out with the disciples :
"“ whoever <UNK> you , <UNK> me ... and whoever <UNK> me , <UNK> the <#> who sent me ."
"” "" whoever <UNK> you , <UNK> me ."
""" i take this to mean that <UNK> is not an option for those who would love god ."
those who love god must first love their all too human ( and sometimes less than <UNK> ) brothers and sisters .
the reality of our faith is bound up in down to earth relationships – whether we like it or not .
here ’s a story shared with me years ago by a woman named <UNK> when i served her <UNK> as a brand new <UNK> .
<UNK> writes : “ i was raised in ohio in a deeply religious roman catholic family where bias against those of different faith or color was not <UNK> .
early incidents in my childhood had impressed upon us the fact that my father would not tolerate such behavior among us in his household .
” shortly after the start of world war ii our local <UNK> sponsored a japanese - american family <UNK> from california .
their <#> children – joe and amy -- were with our family until <#> .
"to me they were just another younger brother and sister to put up with … but to my sister <UNK> , amy was her best and closest friend ."
and it came to pass that a classmate of theirs was having a birthday party …
"when <UNK> <UNK> , mother forced to bring her face - to - face the harsh reality from which our family life had <UNK> her"
: there were places that amy wasn’t welcome because she was different than we were . because she was japanese .
<UNK> ’s response was to refuse to attend the party herself .
"“ if amy ’s not invited , i’m not invited ."
proud to be part of a family that took its stand against <UNK> and bias .
let us refuse to settle for being invited ourselves – let us not rest until “
the prophet <UNK> says it best : do justice .
"… that until we’re all invited everywhere , god isn’t finished with any of us yet ."
"· love kindness : like <UNK> , standing up when we encounter bias or <UNK> … speaking out on behalf of those without power to speak for themselves ."

michael <UNK> <UNK> and john clinton <UNK> was blessed and their relationship recognized by the church ...
"<UNK> implies emotional <UNK> , possibly <UNK> with therapy ."
"make no mistake , p was a great guy and i did ( and maybe still do ) love him very much ."
the problem comes from a common <UNK> with men : total lack of willingness to <UNK> any effort into the maintenance of a relationship .
"but , <UNK> , i’ll settle for a <UNK> card and some flowers every now and then ."
"my own pillow a week into dating , a <#> pack of diet mt ."
dew for easter and a <#> minute massage at a day spa for my birthday .
no “ let me run you a bath ” or “
"why don’t i get you a bottle of wine and rub your <UNK> he sat there , rarely speaking and watched tv both"
when i actually <UNK> i might need some comfort he had the <UNK> to act annoyed .
"<UNK> again , members of the jury : a pillow , some soda and a <#> minute massage ."
and i think we may have just arrived at that <UNK>
"in the last couple months , i have <UNK> my legal separation and <UNK> <UNK> into the dating arena ."
"as i was wrapping up the loose ends of my second failed marriage , i was <UNK> looking forward to <UNK> ."
i wanted to walk the fine line between free - <UNK> and total <UNK> slut .
"they must be <UNK> cute , very young and , frankly , not too bright ."
"you have <UNK> to great sex twice a week for about a month and then move on to someone you can actually take seriously , in terms of dating ."
"you know , someone you can use words with more then <#> <UNK> during a conversation ."
you get loads of frequent ( if very quick and sometimes <UNK> ) sexual encounters and don’t have to worry about “ where this is going ” .
"the kitchen counter , maybe to a parking lot or restroom stall but that ’s about it ."
"you know , just when you think that you’ve got it all figured out , life throws you a <UNK> ."
the punch - line to the <UNK> is that he ’s <#> of the managers at my favorite pub .
"<#> night i got the nerve up ( oh , alright , i had several beers and he looked good ) and"
"i confess i actually also <UNK> my friends ( male and female ) with some mixed results , but most of this is observation and personal trial and error ."
this is the premise with which i set out to <UNK> the not always smooth dating <UNK> .
"if he doesn’t call after <#> hours , he ’s an asshole or just not interested ."
"when he calls a week later and says he was in a car wreck , broke his arm and couldn’t dial , ask to see the cast ."
"if he doesn’t have <#> , feel free to provide the need for it ."
"when he says something like “ no <#> has ever gotten me off that way , usually i have to have actual sex ”"
it ’s a bullshit <UNK> to <UNK> you into more blow jobs .
"when it comes to sexual <UNK> , men under <#> typically provide <UNK> ."
"younger guys usually can get there more often , older guys actually care that you get there as well ."
"under <#> is only good for <#> am booty calls , particularly if you don’t want to wake up with them in the morning ."
keep cab numbers handy incase they think you’re making breakfast in bed for them .
most men like beer and they like women who like beer .
"specifically , most men like a woman who likes beer and doesn’t make an ass of herself in public when she drinks ."
real men are not impressed by any kind of <UNK> .
a girl who drinks the flavor of the month <UNK> has “ high maintenance ” written all over her .
"there is a specific , direct <UNK> between the amount of <UNK> performed and the amount of romantic <UNK> performed ."
simple math : more <UNK> = more <UNK> out .
it ’s more important to date someone because of who he is not what he does .
a doctor will probably have no time for you .
the ceo of a company will probably screw around on you and bleed your bank account dry .
"be aware that in the end , money does not buy you happiness and love , even if it buys you a <#> <UNK> diamond ring ."
"yes , some men are threatened by women who make more than they do ."
"if the guy consistently allows you to pay because you make more than he does , he ’s going to <UNK> you eventually ."
the sugar - momma he ’s been waiting for .
"men under <#> don’t care what you make , as long as there is sex involved ."
most consider it a bonus if you pay for everything and they get laid .
deal with it and don’t make a scene .
"that does n't let them off the hook , just be aware they hate it ."
he does not care that your $ <#> designer <UNK> matches your outfit perfectly .
"actually , he doesn’t care about your shoes at all ."
do not be insulted that he doesn’t react with great excitement at your fabulous taste in <UNK> .
"in fact , if he does react with great excitement , be afraid ."
it ’s not playing fair to wear them the first <#> months you date and then to stop .
that ’s called the “ <UNK> and switch ” .
don’t get mad if he does something that you don’t like especially if you haven’t told him .
"this goes for opening doors , making plans for the date , sexual <UNK> , etc ."
most men ’s behavior is <UNK> programming from their last relationship .
"<UNK> liked it doesn’t mean you do , but how the hell is he supposed to know that if you don’t tell him ?"
men don’t like a lot of “ relationship talk ” .
"what most men want out of a relationship is to enjoy it , not to talk about it ."
"when you feel a need to give him tips on your likes and <UNK> , make it clear , simple and straight to the point ."
"if you tell him point blank what you want and stil do n't get it , he 's probably not the guy for you ."
"finally , keep in mind , men are people , too ."
"while we sometimes forget it , they do have the same kind of feelings , <UNK> and emotional needs that we do ."
in many ways they have it much harder than us .
"if we’re uncertain about something , we have girlfriends that we talk to ad <UNK> about the details of our relationships and feelings ."
it is not <UNK> of for a <UNK> of women to <UNK> over <UNK> to spend <#> hours discussing the nature of a single phone call or email .
"men just don’t do that with each other , ever ."
"it doesn’t stop them from having the same needs women do ; love , <UNK> , laughter , passion , comfort , trust and respect ."
"you do n't want to have the same foods over and over , right ?"
"and if you never ordered anything but vanilla ice cream from <UNK> <UNK> , you would be missing out on a <UNK> of delightful taste bud experiences ."
"as with the fuel for our body , the fuel for our soul requires variety to keep it satisfied ."
"the blood friend : this is a sister , brother , cousin or someone in your actual family that you are close to ."
this is a person that shares your unique family history in a way that hours of sharing stories about your childhood ca n't match .
the childhood friend : these are the people you keep up with from high school or earlier .
"these are the friends that knew you and loved you through the days of <#> 's hair and <UNK> ; first kisses , first <UNK> , first loves ."
they are the ones who remind you of who you are deep down and do n't let you get too full of your own life 's <UNK> .
the soul mate friend : this is the person you call first and foremost whenever anything goes right or wrong in your life .
this person is the <#> you know you can call at <UNK> when your world falls apart .
they are also the person you can call at <UNK> just to chat .
this friend is <#> of those traveling buddies you know you can go on trips with and they wo n't make you nuts .
you do n't have to talk every day but you do begin to experience <UNK> symptoms after a week .
the party friend : this is the buddy you call to go <UNK> the town with on the weekends .
"typically you have similar personal situations ( single , married , <UNK> ) and you like the same kind of places to let loose ."
this is the kind of friend you can go out with but you do n't have to stay glued to each other 's side every minute of the night .
you split <UNK> and share <UNK> and always have a good time doing it .
he knows you well enough to know better than to want to date you .
"the fabulous gay friend : not to stereotype , but as carrie <UNK> said , the fabulous gay man is the <UNK> every single woman over <#> must have ."
these are the men who can help you pick out just the right outfit and shoes for any occasion .
"he 'll tell you that , yes , those pants do make your ass look too big and that the guy you are crushing on is bi - sexual ."
he may not be flaming but he 's definitely got the sparks workin .
"<UNK> : these are the <UNK> , the fudge syrup or the cherry on top of your life ."
"for every <#> of those regular and devoted friendships , we have a dozen of people that we know only casually ."
they are the outer circle of your life but no less valid to your support system .
you call up when you get the urge but it 's not a regular thing .
do you think that man is never going to piss you off ?
"more tales of action , drama , <UNK> , horror and hopefully true love to follow <UNK>"
so <#> of the first things you have to know about me is that i am a very socially active person .
we love our kids but we just do n't find <UNK> in letting our every waking moment <UNK> around them.. does that make us bad parents ?
"their "" we "" <UNK> <UNK> twins have more space between them than half the couples i know and tend to be way less <UNK> , in my opinion ."
"above , are some postings i made at another blog location ."
"unfortunately , that place , while lovely , did not run very well ."
i could n't get logged on half the time .
"so , we 'll see if this works any better ."
the first posting technically was done back in november .
kerry is not the do - all and end - all of the <UNK> to bush .
"the fact is , he is the current alternative to bush ."
"i would prefer to be passionate about who i vote for , as opposed to being passionate about who i 'll vote against ."
"<UNK> , the person who <UNK> emotion in me for this election is bush , and that is who i will be voting against ."
"gore <UNK> <#> <UNK> in my bones , while bush made my skin crawl ."
the little <UNK> liar gave me the <UNK> .
"from the day the republican ' party ' announced him as their candidate , i was not going to vote for him ."
"that being said , the party that puts a strong candidate in the running will get my vote ."
"as it stands , the parties are putting candidates out who they feel will offend the least ."
we do n't need products who are easy to <UNK> .
we need leaders who will do the best for america .
bush 's entire <UNK> can be shown in a <UNK> presentation .
that fucker is on vacation more than anything else .
too bad the democrats ca n't come up with a candidate who <UNK> more emotion than ' he 's got to be better than bush ' .
short for we b log ? or just another stupid semi - <UNK> invented for the 21st c. ?
"supposedly , these ' blogs ' are the new ' journalism ' or the new ' voice of a generation ' ."
"also , hopefully , this blog will allow me to argue with people ."
"i love to argue , and if a good debate is presented , then i may take the <UNK> ."
"i may just use this to post my drunken ramblings , but i may also use this blog for evil ."
there are folks out there that need to be taken down a notch .
ma <UNK> de <UNK> a <UNK> se <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> .
"<UNK> que <UNK> la <UNK> , <UNK> me <UNK> <UNK> ."

"i ca n't say it 's a bad day , but i ca n't say everything is going <UNK> either ."
first sign something is wrong is that i 'm writing this at work when i 'm <UNK> and drowned under <UNK> .
i 'm losing the little bit of faith i had in me .
"i 'm tired all the time and most of all , i do n't care if i do n't work correctly ."
"last time i did that , i was taking <UNK> off without telling anybody ."
i was self - destructive so other people would take care of the situation for me .
"i guess that to feel better , i have to "" <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> "" and take the situation in my own hands ."
"but i 'm not feeling very well and moreover , i do n't know what to do ."
"just not loving a job , it 's somebody hating me and doing all sorts of things to make me look bad ."
"if i could just not care , do my little things while listening to music ."
i do n't want to be sick again !
i 'm spending a week in montreal next week ... for music
... could it be that i do n't want to go so much that it 's playing a role in me being sick ?
"well , kinda , because i took days off to "" babysit "" my son ."
"then , on saturday , we 're driving him to the in - laws for a week ."
"because , even if i work , i will be able to go at my own <UNK> and stay at work as long as i want . stress free !"
"then , it 's preparation time to spend a week in montreal , studying music with daniel while taking care of <UNK> and my parents at night ."
can i say that i can not wait for july 9th to be there ? ! ?
"oh well , let 's go clean my desk then ..."
"i'm downloading a <#> hour <UNK> show ; after <#> hours , i have <#> % done ."
"it 's a <UNK> file , i * pray * it 's going to work ."
i read somewhere that friendship is the most important thing .
"feeling guilty , i sent an email to <UNK> , isa and sophie ."
i had decided a while back to stop being the <#> always trying to keep up the relationships .
"sophie has n't written to me since february and it was because i sent her a email for her birthday , because she had forgotten mine ."
"<UNK> writes more often , and she does n't even have a computer at home ."
"this week , i will send an email for jean 's birthday ."
"of course , * i * also remember partners and kids birthday ."
friends and family take for granted i will keep in touch .
"colleagues and boss take for granted i will do the work , but that i do n't need thank - <UNK> or compliments ."
guy takes for granted i 'm going to be there for <UNK> and the house .
even my <UNK> told me to get mad sometimes .
probably a side - effect of my low self - esteem .
i think that i wo n't win anyway .
"i do n't want to be nice anymore ! if isa and sophie do n't answer back , well f * * * off ."
it 's so tough to be all alone .
"i do n't have any close friends , people that i can actually talk to ."
i have to write in my journal or the internet .
i have to keep memory of urllink this link .
the 16th button starting from left is wicked ! nice way to <UNK> !
"not doing anything , reading and being on the net ."
"the weather is so - so , windy and <UNK> clouds ."
a quote that came to my mind : urllink music is soothing urllink and <UNK> impatient souls .
<UNK> question : should i or should n't i reveal myself to m. ?
"my interests are still music , literature , art , <UNK> and i still work in a library as a <UNK> while taking care of my son ."
"i liked watching him on tv , hearing his famous critics ."
"i will listen to him on radio , even if it means closing the computer and the tv early ."
i adore them and listen to them all the time .
"<#> ) why this blog is in english , since i 'm a <UNK> pure <UNK> ."
"well , english is the international language , so more people can figure out what i 'm writing if i get visitors ."
"moreover , i need to practice so i do n't lose my english ."
"and finally , sometimes , my thoughts come more easily in english ."
"but sometimes , i will write in french ."
it will depend how inspiration comes to me .
"for example , my site church of <UNK> is in french , despite its english title , because that 's how i imagined it ."
"hey , why not visit urllink my site ? :)"
"however , michael jackson was awarded a birthday cake from <#> of the village people ."
sorry if i 'm a little <UNK> today .
i had a run in with our infamous <UNK> today .
"i thought that christine had the all - time worst relationship with a door - <UNK> , but ours puts hers to shame ."
will someone please tell me about the highlights of the <UNK> ?
sorry i ca n't make it to <UNK> this weekend .
i need to help <UNK> move the rest of his stuff to cleveland .
but a trip is somewhere in the near future ...
"i can see it now : <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> enjoying a nice cold <#> at lee 's liquor lounge ."
that sounds like my kind of dream weekend .
"as long as <#> <UNK> plays something by <UNK> , of course ."
"oh , <#> more thing : panda , if you come to <UNK> , then i can meet you !"
i 'm guessing that will push it right over the top !
i went to the state fair last night . here

but the state fair people still made me pay my full <#> dollars to get in !

poor as a church mouse with writers block .
i 'm gonna start a sweep stake on my new <UNK> .
it 's usually off before it 's been on a month .
last night was <#> of the weirdest nights sleep i 've had for years .
i kept having these ultra vivid dreams that would wake me up .
no sooner than i put my head on the pillow i 'd have another <#> and wake up again .
but i do remember <#> dream which involved <#> suicide <UNK> in <UNK> .
hope that <#> does n't come back to haunt me .

a friend of mine who works in <UNK> in <UNK> met bill clinton in the toilets .
he could n't resist it and got a picture of bill 's old man with his picture phone .
i ca n't possibly post it . <#> .
i 'm a bit of an <UNK> <UNK> at times especially on the phone and by email .
"it 's not that i do n't keep in contact , it 's just that i 'm no"
good at small talk or idle <UNK> <UNK> .
i guess then that this <UNK> is a fantastic therapy .
i certainly feel alot happier since i started it and i hope it <UNK> someone 's day .
i have finally got my act together and will now attempt to post at least twice a week .
thanks to <UNK> for giving me the inspiration to actually share the inside of my head with the rest of the world .
"i am not an accomplished writer , nor am i even remotely hip ."
"i am a strange and <UNK> girl , living in a foreign culture ."
"this post is actually a trial run , so look for something more substantial very soon ."
i really thought i 'd have something to say to the world .
"i did n't , but now i do ."
i have <UNK> an incredibly bad patch of road this past year .
"the only thing i have left is a sense that the world is generous , both with crap and with amazingly <UNK> relationships ."
i am now ( really and truly for those who 've heard this before ) a single mom on the <UNK> .
"i am living by the skin of my teeth and the charity of strangers in <UNK> , nc ."
"i am back in the book business , working part time for a chain store ."
"i love the books and the people who read them , but am not sure i still support the company 's <UNK> ."
i 'm not sure where i need to go from here .
i have followed others ' trials via blog and have gained some insight as to where i need to take my life .
i just feel so un - capable and so isolated right now .
perhaps i can use this medium to make some connections or at least find a concrete way to solve my own problems .
i have truly become a person without much to say .
no <#> who knew me growing up would have ever thought that .
but i guess the point is that i am afraid that i have become too <UNK> or too stupid to say anything anyone would want to read .
then i think about my life and realize i need to say something .
"if nothing else , my views could be read as a <UNK> tale for young women ."
i guess a little update would be in order for those of you who are interested ...... i'm still in <UNK> .
i 'm even more financially <UNK> than ever .
"i did get promoted to management with the bookstore , but have had to step down ."
my daughter 's father left town suddenly in october .
he had lost another job and ran home to <UNK> .
"he was n't contributing financially to our daughter 's <UNK> , but he was watching her at night and on weekends when i was working ."
"when he left , that fell apart and i had to step down ."
so now i 'm back to part - time <UNK> and looking for work in an environment with <UNK> % unemployment .
"i'm trying , with help from my church and my parents , to hang on until fall <#> , when i hope to be going back to finish school ."
"i realize i 've said this before , but i 'll really be there this time ."
.... as to the other things in my life .... i've found comfort and <UNK> in returning to organized religion .
those of you who are familiar with my beliefs will be a little surprised .
i can only say that i know i am now where i belong .
i find strength in the community and in the individual growth i have begun .
i hope to give her the solid base for spiritual exploration i was given by my parents .
the peanut is showing signs of being <UNK> by the drama of the last year .
i am working with the staff at her pre - school and the church to help her be <UNK> and happy .

there is great reward in being a mommy .

he is familiar and fun and oh so creative with this medium .
i am leaving <UNK> to go back to <UNK> next weekend .
i just could n't hold everything together financially and am running back to the shelter and relative safety of an evil corporation . <UNK> ! !
"so , i 've decided to give up trying to be <#> ."
school and a degree are still on the table for fall <#> .
my daughter is still showing signs of being worse for the wear from this past year 's drama .
i am still trying to love her out of it and will hope for the best .

"i did however meet , in a manner of speaking , a psycho - in - training online ."
"yes , i was smart and kept my distance , but man , i 'm telling you , <UNK> is simply not attractive ..."
this guy turned from casual friend to possible cyber - stalker in the course of <#> evening .
"anyway , no more of that for me ."
i 'd rather be isolated from the opposite sex forever than go through that again.. ....
i want to say thanks to <UNK> and to <UNK> for <UNK> their respective souls on their blogs this past year .
i take <UNK> from their stories and hope to be as far down the path to recovery from drama as they are during the next year .
"again , i 'm <UNK> the "" kick my ass and make me post "" challenge to anyone out there ."

i signed the offer letter on may <#> .
"today , june <#> , is the first time i got any kind of communication about a transition date ."
"<#> weeks , like any normal establishment , <UNK> ."
i get the pleasure of split shifts <UNK> downtown and the <UNK> area .
then i finally get to be at my new job full time .
this will make about <#> weeks from the date i signed the stupid letter .
kinda make me wonder if being an <UNK> might have served me better .
"i have worked for this bunch since <#> , with a short <UNK> to the <UNK> ."
i have a work <UNK> in me from my family that makes me an easy target here .
"they pride themselves on <UNK> the most out of a penny in overhead they can so they can report "" record <UNK> "" to the <UNK> every quarter ."
for heaven 's sake it 's not even an industry i 'm passionate about .
i guess it 's for the paycheck and the insurance .
i guess it 's to tell myself that at least <#> person in the investment house really cares about how we take care of peoples ' money .
i guess it 's ' coz i ' m <UNK> stupid to tell the truth .
"i suppose i 'll feel better in the morning , but right now , i 'm just mad as hell ."
good morning or whatever depending upon where and who you are .
i am sitting in my kitchen wondering if i will ever have anything important to say .
i am just getting that smack on the head moment that it 's all important because we 're all connected .
so enough of my shy and self - <UNK> bs .
"by this means the encourage , assist and conduct <#> another to good deeds . """
"saint francis de sales see , it 's really all about "" who you know "" after all ."
i have been thinking about this for a year or more .
i understand it better than ever before in my entire life .
over the last year i have been walking in faith with new people .
i have said many times that i felt called to be here .
god has put me here and used my new family of faith to heal me .
he has given me a safe harbor in which to <UNK> for my journey into <UNK> waters .
i am so thankful for so many things and people that words escape me most of the time .
so here i am in that safe harbor .
"i am still tossed about when the winds <UNK> through , but i am able to right myself and move forward ."
"truly , i should have done this years ago ."
it scares me beyond the telling of it .
"i 'm afraid that when i go before the judge , he or she will examine my life and find me <UNK> . crazy ?"
but it 's my perception and it 's valid if it scares me .
", but people freak out anyway ..... you get me , right ?"
it just did n't come in some big burning bush .
"it came from a person , used by god , to tell me that the connection 's the thing ."
it 's what we need and crave and long for .
it 's what we miss when we live in the world and become part of that empty race .
"it 's what we are given the tools to create here on earth through the word , but seldom do ."
"thank you , jesus , for the gifts you have given me : the family , the connection , the body ."
your kingdom come ... through us in the here and now and for all time .
my best friend and i have struggled over an idea we have from scripture .
i had an <UNK> bad non - marriage relationship .
we are currently having an open dialogue about what scripture says on marriage after divorce .
"let me put it all out here and if there are thoughts , they would be helpful and appreciated ."
we have both come from church <UNK> where divorce and <UNK> seemed to be non - issues for our <UNK> .
"heck , my home church even called a <UNK> pastor at <#> point ."
"the point is we both grew up seeing it and understanding it as "" ok "" ."
"in the south , that 's a big difference ."
she started this whole conversation when things started to get really rough in her second marriage .
she had dated this man when we were all in high school and college .
they <UNK> <UNK> about <#> years after her divorce .
understand that they had maintained a friendship through the years .
we have a very close - knit tribe of about <#> of us from our teen years .
distance does n't matter very much and we are still all pretty close .
i guess i 'm saying this to explain that she and he had a <UNK> friendship upon which to build a marriage .
they dated for about a year and then he proposed .
we had a great time getting ready for the wedding .
they went through a very detailed counseling process at her home church with a pastor they both knew and respected .
he spent lots of time building a healthy relationship with her <#> year old daughter .
"he even got to know her ex - husband to a degree , thinking it could ease any parental <UNK> which might arise ."
"i felt like they were really doing it right , to ensure the health and <UNK> of the marriage ."
"things they had discussed , personality traits they had agreed to disagree upon , became sources of conflict ."
the real - child vs step - child thing <UNK> .
they became <UNK> and even counseling did n't work .
i wo n't go into all of the details here but it got bad .
they have come back together now and some healing has happened .
the thing is that my friend is now wondering if all of the work they did in the beginning was pointless because scripture <UNK> <UNK> after a divorce .
i got married to a non - believing alcoholic .
we left the country and lived in a crazy military community where <UNK> was the norm .
i was going through some big rebellion against any <UNK> thinking from my youth .
i was also <UNK> my self - doubt and <UNK> .
put those things in a <UNK> and mix well .
the marriage broke up and we both moved on .
i went looking for a relationship to prove that i was n't a failure .
most of the stuff that <UNK> me from forming a healthy relationship <UNK> from bad choices i made .
"but now , <#> years later , i would like to explore the possibility of a husband ."
so i do nothing and get engaged in living my life . raising my daughter .
but god is n't answering this prayer of mine .
and then i begin to wonder if there is no answer because that 's the answer : no .
we are both wondering if our troubles stem from the fact that <UNK> should n't be an option for either of us .
or is it really the enemy trying to help us into making the same bad decisions with the new relationships and therefore <UNK> <UNK> in the world .
"neither of us know , nor do we feel <UNK> by the word ."
she feels <UNK> and i feel lonely and we try to comfort <#> another .
i feel guilty and selfish for the time i put into worrying over my loneliness .
i pray for the burden to be lifted off my heart .
"we do realize though , that there is a gift in this for both of us ."
maybe <#> of you out there has a word for us .
maybe you could lift us up in prayer .
"whatever the case , we cling to our friendship and our faith ."
"why is it that late at night when i am alone , i end up feeling very lonely ."
is n't it enough that i have an amazing daughter ? or that i have some of the most <UNK> people in my life ?
"apparently not , because i just ache for someone to spend the rest of my life with ."
i want to be <UNK> and <UNK> and loved .
i want to cherish and love someone back .
i want to have the ups and downs of everyday life visit our home and find themselves worked out .
i want to have a partner in crime and plan crazy <UNK> to everywhere and nowhere .
i want to cook a nice dinner for more than <#> on a regular basis .
i want to come home to the prospect of adult conversation .
i want to be myself with someone else .
i want to have philosophical conversation at <#> in the morning .
he is caring and <UNK> and well - read .
he is handsome and charming and a christian .
he is also completly unaware of my crush or even that i think about him .
i read his blog and know some of his friends .
i have spent some time with him at functions and always end up wanting to spend more time with him .
"in my youth , i simply would have <UNK> him out for coffee or something ."
"now , later in life , i find my confidence gone ."
"i worry about "" how <UNK> it look if i asked him out ? "" ."
"i worry that i might not be the "" right sort "" or if i 'm damaged goods ."
"see , there 's my damage right there ."
how much freedom there would be if i could just let him know i 'm interested in getting to know him better .
i 'm getting really tired of feeling <UNK> by my <UNK> . who knows ...
"i'm another year older , am i wiser ?"
"wish me luck , i think i 'm gonna jump back in the pool . ...."
"dessert , coffee and a chick flick .... so relaxing and wonderful ."
"i do n't think they , or anyone else for that matter , really know how hard it is for me to let go and just enjoy the moment ."
the <#> of them were so gracious and easy to be around .
so if they are reading : thank you thank you thank you ! ! !
"oh , and also , i was <UNK> via cell phone for the first time ever ... mrs rains , you rock ! !"
i received flowers and a gift card for books from other wonderful people in my life .
it 's <UNK> and <UNK> to be remembered on your birthday and
i am still seeing the spirit move in my life on a daily basis .
last night we met as a community to worship and pray and <UNK> what the father wants us to <UNK> .... what a gathering .
"i come from a <UNK> church background ( <UNK> of the <UNK> variety , just in case you wondered ) ."
the idea of corporate prayer usually came in the form of the <UNK> .
we just did n't pray the way i 've experienced prayer here in <UNK> .
i think we just said the words because we were expected to say them .
i 'm not sure we all really meant what we said or understood it for that matter .
prayer was not as personal or as real to me then .
i did n't embrace the idea that we can and should communicate with jesus in a <UNK> way .
i do n't think i ever prayed with the expectation that there would or could be an answer .
or i would play let 's make a deal with god .
"you know , "" if you get me out of this , i'll ..... fill in the blank "" ."
but i never sat in the presence of god and lifted my voice to be heard .
"just me , just julie speaking to her <UNK> ."
i 've been blessed in so many ways since finding my way here .
so many that it would take days and days to blog .
<#> of the things i 've learned about prayer is that it 's not nearly as awkward as i thought .
"even though i do n't see myself as a great prayer warrior , i have been able to open myself to the spirit more fully ."
"it used to be that i would worry during prayer time that i would n't have the "" right "" words for someone or some situation ."
i would spend the time others were speaking running through what i would speak at the next pause .
always thinking it had to be big and intelligent and full of ripe meaning and perfect .
i would miss the opportunity to pray with my group and <UNK> the words they had from the spirit .
i did n't want to seem un - christian or whatever .
"he does n't want anything but "" our souls "" as <UNK> puts it ."
he wants our honest hearts not some <UNK> or mask we put on to look <UNK> .
that was a hard lesson in humility for me .
i have such fear of being little and <UNK> that i would puff up in the worst possible way .
i am so grateful for the chance to be an ass in safe environment and to learn this lesson with this new family growing inside and around me .
another thing i have learned is to be less skeptical of the <UNK> .
"years ago , i <UNK> at the idea of god speaking through us in this modern world ."
"in my view , that went out at <UNK> ."
i think i have a better understanding of the leading of the spirit now .
i truly believe we can and do receive wisdom from the father in this day and in this place .
"as the need for <UNK> ( <UNK> me , i am less and less a thomas ."
"i 'm still not sure where i fall on <UNK> and other <UNK> , but <UNK> words ring true for me now ."
"so diverse , yet so much of a tribe ."
we gathered and sang and <UNK> and prayed for guidance .
"i love you , brothers and sisters and i thank you for allowing the spirit to move through you ."
i am so looking forward to the next step in our journey together .
the following is from a letter to a friend in paris now on their way to tokyo .
"i think that most humans assume they have <#> , that we live our lives based on the assumption that we will be alive for some years ."
"if so , what do you see for yourself ?"
can you continue doing what you love into your <#> 's and <#> 's <UNK> significant health problems ?
i just wonder how i will be dealing with life later and of course that brings the question up for friends around me .
"it touches upon larger questions too , at least for me - the question of gee , what is it all about <UNK> ?"
"why and what are we here for and in the end , does knowing that answer make any possible difference in what we do ? should we even care ?"
"anyway , late night musings but i would love to hear from you about it ."
it is a late night beer drinking <UNK> <UNK> tropical night question over <UNK> bowls and <UNK> singing with the full moon rising and trade winds blowing .
"currently back at university , i am in transition once again to a new career and hope to start summer of <#> in a <UNK> assistant program ."
eventually i hope to <UNK> the peace corps again or work with <UNK> sans <UNK> .
"for now though , it is back to work ."
so now we have another convicted criminal heading up the information police .
i refer of course to <UNK> <UNK> who was <UNK> for lying to congress .
we live in a country where our leaders lie to us in the ' interest of national security ' .
"i find it so hard to believe that , i mean really . . ."
"gosh , what is the world coming to ?"
"i for <#> , feel safer from the <UNK> masses when ' <UNK> ' <UNK> is at the <UNK> of our great nation ."
he and oliver north are true <UNK> for standing up for thier beliefs .
"yes folks , the more things change , the more they really , really stay the same ."
how do we know if our species will survive ?
living in northern california i am <UNK> to <UNK> optimism from some quarters of our society .
take at a look at the population clock at <UNK> why do n't you for god 's sake !
<UNK> the spread of enlightenment ( <UNK> out there take note ! ) versus population growth .
"my point , <UNK> obvious of course , is that population growth far <UNK> enlightenment ( or learning ) ."
"most of us never become <UNK> and if we are , some of us do n't even give a damn ."
who has time for enlightenment when you do n't have clean water and are starving ?
at least we are doing our part in america where our society depends on consumption .
we are the <UNK> nation on the planet .
we have more <UNK> people per square mile on the face of the planet than anyone else !
i for <#> am proud to be in a country that can do that .
"it should serve as an alternate source of energy , we could have <UNK> processing plants ( <UNK> 's ) next to power generation plants ."
"not only that , we lock up a higher percentage of our population than any other country on the planet ."
it proves we are superior to everyone else .
i 'm not doing anything to make it better .
"hell , even <UNK> conservatives are doing more than i am !"
"so if you want some facts and the sources ? look them up yourself , read a little and learn how to <UNK> the web for your satisfaction ."
"by the way , nah , i 'm not bitter , just angry , cynical and a realistic <UNK> <UNK> ."
i think we all wonder at times about if what we write will <UNK> the test of time .
"obviously , some people do n't give a damn at all ."
"i wonder , but in the end am fairly sure of the triumph of <UNK> over much of what we humans do ."
"depending on my mood , very sure of it in my own case ! is n't a journal or a blog <UNK> <UNK> ?"
it went well and i interview well . still
", competition is fierce and i may not get in ."
i still feel deep in my soul that much of my short life has led me up to this point .
"the point of being able to apply , the chance to earn a decent living in an <UNK> profession that i feel passionate about ."
"medicine can be a profession that can either really help you , be of <UNK> use ( until you are sick ! ) or end up killing you ."
"still , the commitment is fierce and i <UNK> to have purpose , to contribute , to find meaning in a life ."
i will receive an answer by february <#> <#> .
"yes , there are , at least for me ."
i went on the peace march in san francisco last week .
i could not help but think it was a wasted gesture .
"i heard an <UNK> of the march say on <UNK> ( san francisco 's public radio station ) that the "" . . ."
"white house was <UNK> . . . "" ."
"that was the most <UNK> , stupid and <UNK> remark i have heard in a long time ."
she obviously has not spent any time in the federal government or the white house .
bush could care less and no <#> was ' <UNK> ' from a few <UNK> marching for peace .
want to make a difference ? give up <#> of your cars
volunteer a few hours a week to those who need help .
do n't be a pig when you eat .
develop a conscience for your sake and others .
"in short ( and as we all know ) , talk is cheap ."
i sure as hell need to do more .
i knew of my brothers neighbor who drive very expensive gas <UNK> cars and they march down to the peace <UNK> .
so get on those moral high horses people but do n't change your life
personally i think it sounds great unless you crash and burn which could screw up anybody 's day once you get down to it .
"still , the chance to do some medicine , eat good food and maybe see some warm water for once ?"
davis saw fit to reject my application to the <UNK> assistant program for this year .
a small entering class and another <#> % cut on top of that ( thank you governor gray davis and the <UNK> and <UNK> of the state of california .
"at any rate , the alternate ( note the decided <UNK> of the word , ' backup ' !"
) plan is a bachelor of science in nursing .
if the university gets it together and the budget is available there may be an <UNK> masters of science in nursing i could get through in <#> year .
meanwhile i hate the northern california winter and the incredibly <UNK> <UNK> new age crap that gets <UNK> here .
i did not understand when i was at <UNK> .
"now , thank god after years out of the country , i now know and understand ."
these people are so incredibly spoiled they have the time to indulge themselves in a frenzy of <UNK> and spiritual <UNK> .
"hell , i am guilty of it too , look upon these pages those who doubt my words !"
my hope is i will actually do something about it like i have in the past .
"being here for my dad as he lay dying was good , the right thing to do but"
for me it was home and i still feel no <UNK> with this place .
my whole life has always been moving in some way but <UNK> . . .
it is late and i am about to <UNK> into <UNK> once again .
"i long for the islands , not just hawaii but <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> and on ."
"i remain in america because of an incredibly loving , beautiful woman and her incredibly beautiful and loving daughter ."
"i had something deemed <UNK> , <UNK> and offensive here so this last paragraph was edited for content ."
"this is my new blog , in which i will deliver opinions , ideas , and advice to a grateful world ."
"the very first issue of <UNK> , a monthly magazine covering <UNK> arts and culture , is on the stands now ."
"i wrote a piece entitled "" saving <UNK> , "" about the new <UNK> music academy ."
"urllink read it , urllink comment on it , and then urllink <UNK> to <UNK> so i can keep writing for them ."
"<UNK> did n't run "" urllink the <UNK> <UNK> "" for any high - minded purpose ."
they threw it in during pledge week a few months ago to squeeze the <UNK> - older <UNK> for cash .

from the <UNK> to the <UNK> he entertained <UNK> with an act that was more cocktail party than concert .
the <UNK> and the occasional songs were just an excuse to show off costumes that leave <#> urllink <UNK> .
calling his costumes <UNK> is just inadequate ; it 's like calling the ocean wet .
"<UNK> may be an entertainment <UNK> today , but in the <UNK> the man was huge ."
"when the <UNK> television networks blew him off , he <UNK> himself and ran on more tv stations than "" i love lucy . """
time has n't been kind to <UNK> 's <UNK> .
the jokes fall flat and the music is <UNK> <UNK> .
"yet the costumes and <UNK> are so over the top , so beyond any fashion or style , that they never age ."
even more fascinating is <UNK> 's <UNK> with his fans .
it 's no mystery why those <UNK> ' <UNK> middle - american <UNK> went <UNK> over a <UNK> drag queen .
the urllink <UNK> foundation claims to be the official <UNK> web site .
the urllink estate of <UNK> does too .
the urllink <UNK> museum is the official animated <UNK> <UNK> site .
"the <UNK> museum site carefully <UNK> any mention of the man 's personal life or the cause of his death ( complications from aids , <#> ) ."
"the <UNK> estate mentions only his "" heart disease and <UNK> . """
"at least they said the word "" aids "" on the <UNK> show ."

"<UNK> miles of housing <UNK> , office parks , and strip <UNK> as far as the eye could see ."
"( okay , the eye could n't see very far because of the <UNK> , but you get the idea . )"
we then climbed a few <#> feet into the high desert of the <UNK> .
it was brown with patches of <UNK> and an occasional <UNK> splash of <UNK> .
"the <UNK> is beautiful in a <UNK> and <UNK> way , but not quite the grand empty space you might imagine ."
"<UNK> of thousands of cars <UNK> <UNK> every day between la and vegas , so it 's far from a lonesome desert trek ."
it 's more like city driving without the city .
"still , we were <UNK> by the <UNK> 's sheer scale ."
<#> valley in particular sticks in our minds : greg and
i topped a hill and saw the <UNK> stretching away before us .
"<#> lanes of <UNK> and endless traffic <UNK> to a mere scratch across the sand on the far horizon , where it disappeared over a hill ."
we used the trip <UNK> to determine how many miles stood between our initial view of the valley and that final hill .
the result : just over <#> miles in <#> <UNK> glance .
we got out of la without posting our impressions of that fair city .
today is the day i enter in to the world of computers .
"assuming things go as planned , i will post here often ."
i 'm hoping to eventually move this to my site once i get that started .
"so everyone , hop on and <UNK> your <UNK> ."
it 's going to be a <UNK> ride !
feel free to send your <UNK> or <UNK> : urllink here .
"if you do n't want them published , please let me know ."
"halloween . the second most <UNK> "" holiday "" of the year ."
people crawl out from under everything to get dressed up .
which is why i 'm going out this year as a cynical and <UNK> system administrator who dreams of telling his users to stick it in their <UNK> slot .
"( if you 're not a <UNK> admin , trust me ; that <#> 's a <UNK> . )"
we worked together for a while at a network operations center .
"eric was <UNK> , i was day side ."
"ironically , the person he got the advice from was actually someone that no <#> wants to associate with ."
"anyway , eric and i discovered we had all sorts of interesting aspects of life and personality in common and have become pretty good friends ."
"eric is gaining a reputation for being quoted in blogs , it would appear ."
i had a nice long post talking about how i liked how the page looked and about color - <UNK> all finished .
"then , when i went to publish it , i got a database error ."
i suppose that you get what you pay for .
i 'm a professional geek and i know that <UNK> happen .
"<UNK> with <UNK> , mustard , and extra <UNK> ; <#> piece chicken <UNK> , bbq sauce ; chili ; <UNK> diet pepsi ."
$ <#> . maybe the cute girl with the sad and pretty eyes will be working today .
so i wanted to see what this whole blog thing was about .
i decided to read a random <UNK> of <#> or <#> blogs from this and other sites .
"i do n't guarantee that i 'll spell everything right each time or be absolutely <UNK> correct , either ."
"in fact i write in a very <UNK> tone which frequently <UNK> itself to <UNK> license , so there ya go ."
but i 'm a self - aware sheep .
i do n't really know how often i 'll post .
"i 'm a lazy person by nature , so the simpler something is , the more likely i am to use it ."
but maybe that 's why i like simpler things in life outside of work .
"i 'm gonna stop now and post this , just to see what it looks like ."
a lot like taking a look at those <UNK> before we flick them away .
i promise my next entry will have nothing to do with <UNK> or poop .
did you ever stop to wonder how much <UNK> waste you produce in a lifetime ?
"and , it turns out , i produce a lot ."
how many times to you poop in a year ?
"i go about once a day , on average ."
"anyway , say i miss a few days here and there and go twice in a day here and there ."
"i 'm gonna guess it <UNK> out to about <#> times per year . also because <#> is a nice round number , as opposed to <#> ."
so we have <UNK> <UNK> about <#> times .
i know that when i was a baby i was a <UNK> machine .
"i probably <UNK> the number per year right out the window from <#> - <#> , and then got into a sort of <UNK> routine ."
"i wo n't <UNK> a guess as to frequency , though ."
so we 'll say that i started my ( approximately ) <#> times per year <UNK> routine at about age <#> .
"so i 've been "" in the habit "" for <#> years now , so far ."
"after that , it 'll be <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> time for me ."
"that 's a lot of <UNK> . as a side note , even with a minimal stay of <#> minutes , that 's <#> hours on the pot ! !"
"very difficult , as it 's always so <UNK> ."
but i got a precious few <UNK> ranging from <#> half to <#> full pound per .
so we 'll split the difference and say <#> <UNK> or <#> - quarters of a pound .
"when we grind that through the <UNK> , we arrive at a figure of <#> pounds of poop in <#> years ."
"amazing when you think about it , eh ?"
but i ca n't even get into that <#> right now .
"plus , pee is way more <UNK> than poop ."
"there 's a lot of that going through the <UNK> , too ."
the ancient romans used to use a <UNK> .
middle eastern peoples used their left hand ( which helps to <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> ) .
but <#> tons of poop in <#> years .
i can only imagine the <UNK> if i live to <#> .
and people laughed at me when i said i was gonna start writing in a blog .
more than a month since the last entry .
"i 'm not <#> of those "" i need to update <UNK> so i can tell people about what i had for lunch "" people ."
"i write when i feel like it and , i suppose , i feel like it . much has happened and a little is new ."
i took a <#> mile road trip to phoenix and back all by my lonesome and i liked it .
"i 'd do it again in a minute , with about as much advance planning as i 'd done this time ."
i left on <#> november in my nice rented dodge <UNK> and set out west .
i chose the southern route as i wanted to go through oklahoma city .
"a friend , jon <UNK> , is a grad student at oklahoma u in <UNK> , just outside of <UNK> ."
if i could make it there i had a free floor to sleep on .
"so in the course of a single day , i put nearly <#> miles on me in <#> hours or so of driving ."
i do n't recommend it unless you 're either insane or are stubborn or are really cheap .
you get to decide which <#> out of <#> i am .
got to <UNK> about midnight local time and pretty much collapsed .
"it was a floor to sleep on , sure ."
but it was possibly the <UNK> floor i 've ever had the pleasure of <UNK> on to .
got up the next day and treated jon to his first <UNK> house experience .
i 'm a big fan of 'em and firmly believe that people should really eat there once in their lives .
"the food is good , pretty cheap , and the people watching is superb ."
"left <UNK> and headed west again , down oklahoma and into the texas <UNK> ."
let me just say here that oklahoma city is as different a place as i could have imagined .
"trees and grass everywhere , very standard <UNK> architecture ."
texas is exactly what i thought it would be like .
a lot of open <UNK> land without much of anything between gas stations .
the roads are well maintained and traffic was pretty light .
they just needed to improve the speed limit .
i <UNK> the cruise at about <#> or so and settled back and listened to the cd and watched the world go by .
"i stopped for a late lunch in <UNK> , texas , at a mcdonald 's ."
i do n't know if i can even remember everything that happened on my trip but i did promise myself that i 'd write it all out .
so here i 'll try to finish some more .
"<UNK> , texas is a small town on the map of texas in the <UNK> ."
"texas ' <UNK> goes north and south , rather than east and west like oklahoma 's ."
i 've always thought of it as more the <UNK> of the piano but i do n't think that sounds quite as ummm ... <UNK> as ' <UNK> ' .
"i just looked up <UNK> , texas on <UNK> and find that there apparently is no such place ."
"there 's a <UNK> in new mexico , but i 'm almost positive i stopped for lunch in texas ."
"anyway , wherever it was i stopped , there was a mcdonald 's ."
"i ordered my lunch , which i remember was a big mac ."
she was wearing a thin <UNK> <UNK> that showed way too much of her middle .
"while not fat , really , she certainly had enough extra that the part not covered by cloth was coming out for a peek around ."
she was also <UNK> <UNK> around her chest and arms and upper back .
there were probably more but i was trying to keep my brain from imagining those possibilities by digging my <UNK> into my <UNK> .
"she had the <UNK> "" <UNK> "" look all around ."
she walked into the mcdonald 's <UNK> a greasy mcdonald 's bag and asked to see the manager .
the manager looked <UNK> and i ca n't say as i blame her .
so she went in back and was looking through the manager 's log for any mention of this .
she was being a <UNK> person and trying to make sure that the store was n't getting ripped off .
but that 's why i 'm not a mcdonald 's employee anymore .
so i sat back and watched while the manager went and looked in the log for a note which explained what was going on .
apparently she could n't find such a note and was <UNK> in getting hold of the manager from the previous night .
"again , in my book , this is going above and beyond the call"
and i would have definately done whatever it took to get her out of my store .
but the manager was not to be fooled .
she continued to try to find out what was going on .
"maybe she had knowledge that i did not regarding <UNK> and her boyfriend , who was waiting in their car ."
"amazingly , i finished my lunch before this whole ordeal was closed ."
if i had n't been in a hurry to get back on the road again i might had stuck around to see what <UNK> .
"as i left the store , the manager was on the phone and <UNK> looked ...."
"i 'll leave you , gentle reader , to draw your own conclusions as this was what i was forced to do ."
"i never know what to think of these sorts of things , but this seems to be fairly on the money for me ."
"with a score this balanced , it is likely that you would have slightly different results each time you complete this self - assessment quiz ."
"you are a well - rounded person , <UNK> <UNK> and artistic , an active and <UNK> <UNK> ."
"at the same time , you are logical and <UNK> , can operate well within an organization , and are sensitive towards others without losing <UNK> ."
"although a "" thinking "" individual , you "" take in "" entire situations readily and can act on <UNK> ."
you sometimes tend to <UNK> in your learning styles .
"learning might take you longer than someone of equal intellect , but you will tend to be more <UNK> and retain the material longer than those other individuals ."
"overall , you should feel content with your life and yourself ."
"you are , perhaps , a little too critical of yourself -- and of others -- while maintaining an "" <UNK> "" which <UNK> that tendency ."
and i can almost name the presidents in order .
so i 've promised <UNK> that i 'll write to her more often .
"heather has <UNK> lit a fire under my butt , having written something only slightly shorter than urllink the <UNK> ."
"i , however , am going to content myself with sending her <UNK> for the moment . and"
"my little niece , <UNK> jane <UNK> , was born yesterday , friday , september <#> , <#> ."
she 's <#> lbs <#> oz and <#> inches long . and has black hair . and is a very cute little girl .
let me see if the help menu can help me .
let me check out the support page on the web .
"we 're taught to use a <UNK> , but not how to add or <UNK> ."
"we 're taught how to use our computers , but not how they operate ."
"we do n't need to know these things , because somewhere out there a computer or machine can do it for us ."
"monday night football the game was a bust , the <UNK> were getting their butts handed them on a <UNK> ."
it was <#> - <#> when i left part way into the fourth .
did n't really have much at stake in the game since i do n't really follow either team .
"i like jerry rice , though , so i always hope for a good game for him ."
"he was n't being used to his potential tonight , unfortunately ."
<UNK> looked like a high school <UNK> out there too at times .
i 'm not quite sure how they made it to the <UNK> but they really started falling apart during that game and i think it 's continued .
the bay has fallen on some hard times this season .
brett is n't as strong as he used to be .
"they 're opening the "" new "" soldier field , too ."
i drove by it when it was nearly done about <#> months ago .
they just <UNK> kept the outside walls of the old soldier field and built a new stadium inside .
except there 's no <UNK> to bind the <#> together .
well .... they built a new football stadium inside an old <#> and forgot to take the walls down .
the good thing is that it 's a classic <UNK> of <#> old nfl teams .
"they 're part of the black and blue division , which detroit is also in ."
they tend to play a much more <UNK> style of football and they have a long <UNK> <UNK> back <#> or so years .
"plus , they both sort of suck so the <UNK> will be a little more even ."
i 'll predict green bay takes this <#> .
there are times i just ca n't figure out how the hell bands come up with names .
".... "" dude ... what would be a good name for a band ? """
""" well ... it 's a metal band ... we 'd better have the name ' dead ' in there somewhere . """
""" <UNK> .... and , like , we 've got soul , so we should put that in ! ! """
""" <UNK> ... this is some <UNK> shit ! !"
"we 're naming the band ! .... what else ? """
""" well ... we 're , like , <UNK> and shit .... like on survivor , where that guy ran around naked . """
""" yeah , they have <#> <UNK> ... so we should be a tribe , cause we 'd kick their ass totally ! ! ! """
""" dude ... this is some real good weed ! !"
"stop <UNK> my <UNK> ! ! "" "" dude ! !"
"shut up and listen ! ! "" "" how about ' tribe of dead souls ' ? "" "" excellent ! ! """
"* * * * * cut to next day * * * * * "" dude ..."
""" yeah , we could tell ... but only until we got high , too ! """
what did we decide on the name of the band ?
""" there was ' dead ' in the title ... and i think ' soul ' ... and , what , ' survivor ' ? """
""" no , man ... ' tribe ' ! ! that was mine ! !"
""" "" yeah ... "" dead soul tribe "" .... that must have been it . """
""" we 're gonna be bigger than <UNK> <UNK> ! ! """
""" dude ... you need more weed ! ! """

that hour would make a world of difference .
so the west - <UNK> have time to get <UNK> the bar after work .
"would it be so hard to have it on a <#> hour tape delay , though ?"
"i mean , they did it for the olympics , and it 's likely that the people watching the game would n't cheat . but"
"even if they did cheat , so what ?"
<#> hour tape delay to the west coast .
let the <#> of the american population who does n't live there get to bed at a reasonable hour .
last night 's game went into ot ( a shitty team like the <UNK> forcing ot .

i did n't leave mitch 's place until a little after <#> am .
"i got home , checked my email -- i 'm obsessive that way , and went to bed at 1:30 ."
"if abc would <UNK> that these games start at <#> pm est , i would have been in bed at 12:30 ."
that extra hour can make all of the difference .
"to top it off , the damn <UNK> won it ."
what kind of a team only makes field goals ? ?
"you must like to <UNK> or be <UNK> , because your romance is <UNK> of secretary ."

i take the elevator when i 'm going more than <#> flight up .
i take the stairs if i 'm going <#> flight down .
"many times , i take the stairs down all the way ."
i have a problem going up because of bad knees and back .
"i can do it if i have to and sometimes i do , when i 'm feeling good . or <UNK> ."
i ca n't figure out people who take <UNK> up just <#> floor .
"they will wait , literally , for minutes ."
<#> or <#> at times when the <UNK> are busy .
"( oh , forgot to mention that <#> or <#> are usually broken at any <#> time )"
"then , when the elevator goes up only <#> floor , they realize their mistake ."
it 's the people who do it all the time .
"who are just there , waiting , because it was easier than going to the <UNK> and using their legs ."
people drive a quarter of a mile to go to a gym so they can walk a mile on a treadmill .

"the urllink <UNK> of flight is december <#> , <#> ."
i suppose it 's <UNK> but people today are so unaware of history as it is that i like to see it correctly represented .
"i got to see <UNK> on tuesday , which was a great and wonderful thing since she 's been in <UNK> since last june ."
"she came here , as opposed to me going to <UNK> ."
heather and i met her for dinner at chili 's to catch up on what life is like in a poor west african nation .
it turns out that we 've got it pretty good here .
"no killing our own chickens for dinner , flush toilets , reliable electricity , no <UNK> or <UNK> in bed , and flush toilets ."
") anyway , there was much good chatting and catching up and a huge amount of <UNK> over not mailing her ."
"i need to do better and i realize that but , as i said to <UNK> , my life is <#> long boring cycle ."
the cycle continues in a regular monday through friday schedule .
"the weekends have a little more <UNK> , in that i do n't work"
"( and when you 're a <UNK> fan , watching football is work ."
"anyway , heather -- who also has a blog urllink here and i agreed that we would regularly send our blog entries to <UNK> ."
regular readers of my blog ( all <#> of you ) will note that i mentioned i was sending her the link to this page for her to read .
she 's a great person with an outstanding sense of humor .
"but she 'll be back by next august , only to go back to michigan tech to finish her thesis work . but"
having her in the same state will be a good thing .
i 'm also more likely to drive to <UNK> than to go to africa .
they 're getting flush toilets at <UNK> sooner .

"recommended , of course , by steve <UNK> ) getting a transmission flush and fluid treatment ."
then i 'll treat myself to an early christmas present and have a decent stereo put in with a cd .
having the truck with it 's cd has spoiled me a little .
"speaking of the truck , i still have it ."
tomorrow i 'll have had it for <#> weeks .
i 'm keeping it until they tell me to give it back .
that truck sucks it down like there 's no freakin ' tomorrow .
i do n't know how people can afford to drive them .
"speaking of which , the <UNK> shop called ... it 's fixed and the shudder is gone ."

"<UNK> concert <#> : like i said , it was awesome ."
"joe <UNK> is a nut , but in a good way ."
there were a lot of songs from the solo works of all of the group but i think joe had more . which is not a bad thing .
"his version of "" life 's been good to me "" was cool ."
"i was working late , preparing for a presentation to a group of kids on the <UNK> of the <UNK> ."
"around <UNK> , i saw a guy coming at me flashing his lights ."
so i was slightly below his hood which made the <UNK> that much brighter .
"anyway , i was trying to figure out why he was flashing his lights at me when i saw the deer in the middle of the road ."
"there was at least <#> buck and <#> or <#> others , though i could n't tell how many ."
i did n't have but a second to react .
i hit him on a <UNK> blow to the front <UNK> of the car .
his chest broke the mirror and his <UNK> shattered the window .
i spun him around and his <UNK> <UNK> the rear door .
"i went into the ditch , where i must have hit something that broke the <UNK> on the bottom since that all <UNK> out and <UNK> everywhere ."
i thought for a minute the car was on fire . not a good feeling ! !
so i got to make my first insurance claim ever .
"the good thing was that i got rental insurance a year or so ago , so i have a nice <#> dakota <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> ."
they have n't told me how much they 're going to give me for it .
"i have <#> days of rental coverage on it , so they 'll have to do something by thursday the 13th of november ."
i 'm not too impressed with their quality of service .
the search for a new car <#> - <UNK> ? ?
this plays well into my plans for a fairly cheap car which will get me around for a few years at least while i get a house .
right now the front runner is a crown vic from <UNK> <UNK> lincoln mercury which is beautiful in all ways .
which is not a good <UNK> it 's being checked by my <UNK> and transmission guy today .

makes me wonder how many people really did complain .
"( fortunately , they will still give you the details if you contact them and ask because , after all , this is public record . )"
we can not <UNK> that which makes us uncomfortable .
we can not pretend history does n't exist .

you can see the urllink home page here .
he 's got just <UNK> of cool content there .
he 's really into <UNK> and put together an amazing guide on weight loss .
he also has a reading list urllink here .
the purpose of this post is to focus on this section .
i went through his list and added <#> or <#> books to my urllink amazon wish list .
( feel free to buy me something from it .
":) if you do , and you go there from john 's reading list , he 'll get a little bonus money ."
anyway i thought this would be a good place to list books that i 'm reading .
i certainly wo n't have the <UNK> of john 's list ; he has <#> listed for january and it is n't even the end of the month !
"i likely wo n't have the quality , either , since i still have childish and <UNK> interests aside from my intellectual and <UNK> ones ."
daddy always said to keep your interests broad ! :)
i just checked out stephen <UNK> 's urllink nothing like it in the world from the library .
i 'm a huge <UNK> fan and definately looking forward to reading it .
it 's the story of the building of the <UNK> <UNK> as told in <UNK> fashion .
sometimes its hard to ponder life without trying to get all deeply philosophical and self - <UNK> .
that 's <#> of the <UNK> to having parents who are older from the start .
"when i was born , mom was nearly <#> and dad was nearly <#> ."
all of my grandparents were born in the <UNK> century .
my mom was an only child and my dad had <#> brother .
"in a time where many children was the norm , i end up in a family who are the poster children for the urllink negative population growth society ."
"my parents produced <#> children : me , jim , and sue ."
i 'm <#> and still <UNK> ( of my own ; i still consider michael my son even though <UNK> and i are divorced ) .
sue has kept the genetic fires burning with <UNK> and <UNK> .
"from my earliest memories , i was told how it was up to me to keep the <UNK> name alive ."
my dad 's brother only had a daughter and my great uncle arthur never had any children of his own .
there was a chance that my brother would get married and have kids but because of his medical problems it was unlikely .
"that left me as the "" man "" ."
"anyway , so i start out in life with little doubt that i 'd have kids eventually ."
suddenly i find myself in a position i did n't plan on : being in my late <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> .
so now i think about the possibility of not having kids .
"it is n't even about carrying on the name , though that 's a nice bonus as i 'm very proud of who i am and of my history ."
but i do n't have kids and i do n't know if i will .
"i 've had <#> offers , <#> quite serious , from friends who are willing to be a <UNK> mom for me to help me be a dad ."
i would first very much love to try to have kids ( and a family ) in the more traditional way .
"lest ye think this is <#> of those angst - ridden "" oh , <UNK> is me "" posts , it is n't ."
"there 's also a certain loneliness factor there , too , like just totally ending up alone"
but i do n't really think that'll happen .
"man , that muse returned with a <UNK> ! !"
my <UNK> cup is n't exactly running over with <UNK> thought but it is n't <UNK> and <UNK> for now .
"maybe my muse finally tired of mai <UNK> and <UNK> and is back at work , albeit hung over ."
<#> thing that 's kind of worrying me about going back to school is the actual school part of it .
i 've taken a couple of classes urllink here and there since my days of urllink master 's work at <UNK> but they were <UNK> classes without much depth .
i 'll have to actually produce thoughtful insight on a regular basis and that kind of worries me .
"i mean , i can <UNK> <UNK> all day with the best of 'em but to be meaningful requires actual thought and actual effort ."
the application to <UNK> requires a writing sample and i 've been trying to figure out what the best form of writing would be .
"i do n't think a fictional piece would be well - received either , unless it had something to do with popular culture ."
that pretty much leaves standard non - fiction research .
they 're also vague ( read : <UNK> ) with guidelines for length of said research .
"in fact , this is the extent of their instruction about this particular task : <#> writing sample is required from each <UNK> ."
"this sample should document your writing and thinking skills , but it does not necessarily have to be an "" academic "" paper ."
"i have time to figure it out , though ."
"i mean , expecting me to think ! ! !"
"i wonder if i could get away with a blank paper with the single phrase , urllink <UNK> <UNK> sum , on it ."
"i mean , it shows i think and that i can be <UNK> with my writing and still get the point across ."
the <UNK> is that it also shows i <UNK> .
they might be a little <UNK> about that part .
"my mind is a painting right now : "" <UNK> bear in a <UNK> "" ."
sometimes at least it has pretty colors and random pictures .
"the muse who was upon me to write has kicked me in the ass , laughing , while she goes off to the bar for mai <UNK> and <UNK> ."
compassion : you are there to share your sympathy with others .
"people would consider you <UNK> and caring , and someone to look up to ."
"when i get in my car after work , i switch the radio over to <#> from its normal spot at <UNK> ."
"the afternoon drive guy there , ken kelly , is pretty funny with a dry and sarcastic wit ."
he also <UNK> in some amusing bits of trivia and <UNK> insight on life in general .
"in other words , he 's a lot like me ."
"i 've talked to him <#> or <#> times , too , when i 've called in and he seems like a pretty good guy on top of it ."
"on monday , i tuned in as is my habit , only to find some wacky talk radio show on ."
"it was curious , since usually when ken is off they put in a <UNK> - band music show ."
i thought it was odd that they would put in a talk radio show instead .
"so , because i 'm a curious sort , i called the station and asked if ken was off sick today ."
i was informed that he no longer worked for the station and they would be replacing his show .
"the girl who answered the phone said they were indeed and i was , by no means , the only upset caller ."
so i ran across urllink this article today as well as urllink this <#> which explain what happened .
"since the station is now owned by a dallas , texas based broadcast company i do n't have much hope for that ."
it sounds like catherine feels the same way .
<UNK> was ann <UNK> 's last widely listened to and <UNK> - owned radio station .
"<#> others , <UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> ) <#> , <UNK> <#> , and <UNK> <#> , are owned by mega - corporation urllink <UNK> ."
"to the best of my knowledge , they only owned <UNK> ( since <#> ) and the personalities there had tremendous loyalty to the company and the owners ."
ken was there for <#> years and ted <UNK> has been on ann <UNK> radio for <#> years .
"he had only a <#> - hour show , from <#> am to noon but it was still interesting ."
"ted has n't been fired , really , but he 's been offered a <#> hour show on saturdays which seems kind of a slap in the face ."
<UNK> may be trying to change their format but i wo n't know about it .
"if they hire ken back , i 'll listen again ."
i thought that all of the urllink mid - american conference schools had <UNK> <UNK> about tuition . or at least the michigan and ohio schools did .
"urllink eastern does ; if you 're an <UNK> , you pay urllink michigan resident rates to go to <UNK> ."
"well that 's cool , thinks i. i can go to urllink bowling green and <UNK> in their urllink popular culture program which is <UNK> known and highly respected ."
"turns out it is n't every mac school , just the ones who want to do it ."
so the urllink per credit hour cost of $ <#> for graduate credits <UNK> to nearly more than $ <#> per semester .
i just ai n't a- gonna pay that kind of coin .
urllink michigan state university has a very good program in urllink american cultural studies .
"i did n't really <UNK> deeply into it since i thought , "" hey , big ten school , big ten prices ! """
"big ten school , not - so - bad prices ."
i can go there for a much lower cost than <UNK> .
the urllink basic cost per credit hour is only $ <#> .
"according to their nifty urllink budget <UNK> , i can take <#> credits at <UNK> for only $ <#> ."
much more in - line with my financial ability .
"and , hey , a big ten school in my home state with my <UNK> <UNK> 's colors ."
now to do some research on the application process .
the <UNK> 's <UNK> test has <UNK> you to the fifth level of hell !
i got a response from the people who do christopher 's show .
we have this idea about how we want our lives to go -- as if we really have control of what 's coming down the <UNK> .
we tend to look at sudden change as <UNK> because it was n't what we had in mind .
we want change as long as everything remains the same .
life hands us opportunity every day to make a difference .
when we <UNK> those opportunities - usually because of fear of the unknown - we feel hollow .
"life can be so rewarding but let 's not confuse "" reward "" with "" comfort "" ."
"that 's pretty damn inspiring . and true , to boot ."
it 's the new year and i remain vaguely <UNK> .
"usually , it 's a case of , "" thanks for fixing that problem for me ."
"here 's another <#> while you 're here "" ."
"if there 's no computers going <UNK> , i 'm invisible ."
"if there are , i 'm on the hot seat ."
she quit her job in early december in order to concentrate on getting her candle - making business ( heather 's <UNK> ) off the ground .
"she did n't have any alternate employment lined up , yet she did it anyway ."
"while i do n't necessarily want to enter the exciting world of candle - making and selling , i want to do something creative ."
i keep on talking about getting a <UNK> . and
there are days where i am and days where i 'm not .
"today , clearly , is a day where i am ."
i just have to make sure that the days i am motivated are greatly <UNK> the days where i 'm not .
taking a look at the current and past urllink um job postings gives me further <UNK> to pursue this .
there are positions that i can fill at all <#> <UNK> .
i do n't mind a long drive if it 's to a job i like .
but even a walk across the street can be torture to get to a job i do n't like .
i guess what it <UNK> down to is making decisions .
but i have to let myself see them .
i 've been reading a lot of urllink stephen e. <UNK> 's work recently .
"today , while reading urllink the <UNK> i came across the follow quote that 's kind of sticking with me : [ talking about his sophomore year at college ]"
"also that year , i took a course entitled "" representative americans "" taught by professor william b. <UNK> ."
"we would , <UNK> told us , be contributing to the world 's knowledge ."
i had never imagined i could do such a thing as contribute to the world 's knowledge .
"<#> <#> years later , the phrase continues to <UNK> with me ."
at the conclusion of the lecture -- on george washington -- i went up to him and asked how i could do what he did for a living .
"he laughed and said to stick around , he would show me ."
i went straight to the <UNK> 's office and changed my major from <UNK> to history .
<#> of <#> signs that came flashing into my face today .
"the other was from , of all people , urllink christopher <UNK> ."
he 's the interior designer on the discovery channel .
i hope to find the little <UNK> he did for his show today .
this <UNK> quote <UNK> the kind of excitement i want to have about my job .
where i can contribute to the world 's knowledge .
"there 's a test for everything , it looks like ."
"i took this test to determine my <UNK> tendencies , but it only <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> : urllink"
"it was fun but there should be categories for <UNK> , <UNK> , great lakes , etc ."
"<#> of the questions does , in fact , have an answer which says "" very common in michigan "" ."
i finished urllink the devil in the white city last night .
"it was a good read ; the story ( stories , really ) are well told and certainly hold the reader 's interests ."
"there 's always a ' but ' , is n't there ?"
the book is written in a more <UNK> manner than i had hoped .
when i read the <UNK> on the back it seemed as though the <#> men 's stories were more deeply <UNK> than they were .
i had expected that <UNK> ' and <UNK> 's paths would have directly crossed or <#> would have somehow influenced the other 's life .
"<UNK> , the author , <UNK> that they likely never met since they did n't travel in the same social circles ."
"<UNK> could have written <#> seperate books , i think , with much better results ."
the <#> <UNK> <UNK> was an amazing feat of engineering and human drive .
"the desire of the united states in general , and chicago in particular , to <UNK> the international exhibition of paris of <#> was plain and simple ."
the urllink <UNK> tower was a <UNK> of the show and was what everyone spoke of .
"the desire to "" out - <UNK> <UNK> "" was stated many times in the book ."
<UNK> ( <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ) was a fascinating <#> all by itself .
"<UNK> was a man born in new england in <#> and the <UNK> , or nearly so , of a <UNK> serial killer ."
"he was a charming and <UNK> gentleman , capable of <UNK> women with his <UNK> and lies , and making men hate him because of that ."
"he settled in chicago , near jackson park , where the fair would eventually be built ."
"<UNK> , in fact , was quite friendly with the police in the area ."
he got away with it for a long time before being arrested for insurance fraud .
"at least <#> , for sure but the true number is most likely much higher than that ."
<#> newspaper estimated it to be as much as <#> but this number is probably high .
"at any rate , it was more than enough to send him to the <UNK> ."
<UNK> 's writing ability is very engaging and he tells a good story .
"but i wish it had been done in <#> separate books , or at least <#> separate parts of the same book ."
"each part could have <UNK> more smoothly , but mentions of what was happening "" on the other side "" would have helped tie them together ."
"would i read it again , knowing what i know now ?"
this book is unlike any he 's written up until now .
"but i would certainly also give his other books a chance , if the subject matter were as interesting to me as this was ."
urllink here 's a link to a listing of his books .
"but use <UNK> , since amazon <UNK> him in with erik <UNK> , <UNK> and others ."
i had a little <UNK> over the last week but i 'm better now .
not totally ok -- not that i 'll ever be that -- but i 'm better . and
... just for the record : urllink st .
valentine was a <UNK> of whom little is known .
the most famous thing to happen on valentine 's day is the urllink <UNK> in <#> .
"when i was little , i used to have a <UNK> "" <UNK> "" ."
"in it , i would be sliding down the <UNK> of a grand <UNK> ."
it was amazingly long and i would fly down it often .
"but suddenly , the <UNK> would turn into a knife edge razor ."
"it would n't cut me in half , per se , but it would torment me as i slid down ."
you 'd think i could have avoided this torment by not thinking about it .
i could n't stop myself from thinking about it and <UNK> about it .
sometimes i would have the first part of the dream without the second .
other times i 'd have the whole thing .
it did n't seem like there was a pattern to what happened when .
in my adult life i have similar things happen .
"when something negative happens to me , i <UNK> about it ."
i go over in my mind all of the negative <UNK> .
"even when there are good aspects , the bad and negative <UNK> them ."
"if you have n't seen the movie , you should ."
"tommy : that 's nice , you look like a helen ."
let me tell you why i suck as a sales man .
let 's say i go into some guys office and let 's say he s even remotely interested in buying something .
i 'm like <UNK> the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet .
"oh , my pretty little pet , i love you ."
"so i <UNK> it , and i pet it , and i massage it , hehe i love it , i love my little naughty pet , your naughty ."
then i take my naughty pet and i go ( makes ripping noises as he tears apart the roll ) <UNK> .
"that 's when people like us gotta <UNK> ahead helen , am i right ?"
"helen : god you 're sick . """
"to achieve a great goal , <#> must bring along <UNK> tape ."
"add a fortune to your website or blog , click here ."
i never thought that she would say say goodbye ; but she did and now i wanna die .
"it 's so hard to make it through the day a man my age is very young , so i 'm told why do i feel so old ?"
"oh , what a scene it 's wrong for her to hang me up this way oh , where you been ? '"
i finished urllink the <UNK> last night .
"while it was a good read , it was a book i could have probably skipped without missing out much on <UNK> 's quality ."
there are a lot of passages lifted from other books he 's written .
"<UNK> urllink citizen soldiers , urllink band of brothers , and urllink d - day : june <#> , <#> ."
i was n't upset about it ; it 's something that he <UNK> in the book .
and there 's never anything wrong with <UNK> the extraordinary <UNK> of these incredible soldiers from all of the services on both sides of the battle .
if i did n't like reading it i would have stopped .
i still recommend it for <UNK> 's discussions of <UNK> 's thinking and decision - making process .
he was <UNK> 's <UNK> and <UNK> to his writings during and after the war .
there are n't many who knew general <UNK> as well and <UNK> as <UNK> .
the next book on the list is urllink the devil in the white city .
"this is a novel which <UNK> the story of the urllink <#> world 's fair in chicago and its <UNK> , daniel h. <UNK> , with urllink <UNK> ."
<UNK> who was <#> of the first true serial killers .
"welcome to <UNK> , owner of the new blog "" urllink <UNK> from my pocket "" ."
may your <UNK> be <UNK> and colorful . :)
"if you do n't read the strip big top by rob <UNK> , you should ."
urllink today 's strip was funny and provided me with some memories as well as being thought <UNK> .
"in it , <UNK> the lion is taking pete , a <#> year old boy who 's growing up in the circus , to get some clothes ."
he asks the sales person if they have any <UNK> jeans .
"for those who do n't know , <UNK> <UNK> were almost a rite of passage in the <UNK> ."
they were probably the only article of clothing which would have been acceptable wear to attempt to survive an <UNK> weapon .
i wore them a lot during my <UNK> years .
<UNK> replies that pete wears the knees of his jeans out really fast because he 's always outside running and jumping and climbing .
"<UNK> asks the <UNK> what he might suggest as an alternative , to which the <UNK> replies "" <UNK> "" ."
it occurred to me as i was reading this strip that i did n't even know if <UNK> were sold any more .
"not surprising , since i 've graduated on to more <UNK> clothes now ."
"( besides , they do n't make <UNK> in my size , even "" <UNK> <UNK> "" ."
a <UNK> of the <UNK> website shows me that they sadly are not making them any more .
"in fact , the only reference to them appears to be the title of a urllink <UNK> <UNK> cd , "" growing up poor - <UNK> jeans "" ."
i got to thinking about why they do n't sell them anymore .
is it because they 're out of fashion ?
"is it because there are other similar and more <UNK> <UNK> ( which would be surprising , since they seemed to be worn typically by the poor kids ) ?"
did you know that <UNK> is identified by the urllink <UNK> as a drug with a high abuse potential ?
"the first <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> manual ( <UNK> - i ) , published in <#> , contained no mention of anything like attention deficit disorder ."
"it was included in the <UNK> - iii , published in <#> , for the first time in anything like its present form ."
i do n't argue with the fact that there are <UNK> out there which cause attention deficit .
"for those people , i think that medication may be a possible solution ."
but i think there are a lot fewer people ( read ' children ' ) who suffer from this who are popping pills daily .
children are interesting creatures ; they are the perfect <UNK> for scientists .
"when they encounter something that interests them whether for the first time or the <UNK> time , they devote their attention to it ."
"that 's not attention deficit , that 's attention priority ."
today 's society is filled with more <#> - income families .
there is little time for children to be children .
"mom and dad are busy <UNK> them between daycare , then to soccer practice , then to karate , then to violin lessons , then to whatever is next ."
they have nothing but structure in their lives .
this is the <UNK> of what being a child is about .
"the child will do something , whether they want to or not ."
"if little <UNK> says , "" i do n't want to do any of those things ."
"i want to just play with my friends outside . """
<UNK> ca n't play with his friends outside because all of his friends are taking violin lessons or playing soccer or basketball .
my mom was a stay - at - home mom .
"she was there when we left for school -- for that matter , so was dad ."
he was a <UNK> who made his own schedule -- and she was there when we got home from school .
i was asked if i wanted to try things out : basketball at the elementary school .
i did n't stick with any of them except for <UNK> .
but there was no <UNK> given me when i did n't like it .
there was no pressure on my parents to keep up with anyone or prove their kid was better or more active than anyone else 's .
i grew up in urllink the country .
"well , it was the country when i was growing up in it ."
what was the country is a bedroom community now .
but growing up in the country was a good deal .
there was plenty of open space and plenty of room to do as i pleased .
there were n't many kids around who were my age so i did n't have a whole lot of friends .
i did have a few friends nearby who would come over and we 'd do all sorts of things that were fun .
and we wore the knees out of our <UNK> .
big top is a really good comic and it has some really funny strips .
but i had a hard time laughing about the message that today 's strip sent .
it was n't an offensive message or anything that 's gonna make me want to write to the editor or anything .
"it was , in the end , a sad commentary on the way we treat our children today ."
"first , you should read heather 's urllink feb 4th blog entry ."
"she 's a smart <#> , that heather ."
"here 's ( most of ) the email i sent her in response : feb <#> , <#> very thoughtful entry yesterday ."
sometimes it 's weird how similarly you and i think .
i 've had the same sorts of doubts for many years .
"you know i do n't like the holidays , if not just for the lack - of - family issues but also for the <UNK> <UNK> of it all ."
there 's little warmth to christmas that is n't generated by advertising or retail sales or <UNK> motives .
i do n't necessarily <UNK> to the standard christian views about everything and i know that december <#> is n't really jesus ' birthday .
but it is n't going to be <UNK> genuinely by anyone who is n't looking for something to sell .
"let 's have a day that 's just "" present - giving day "" ."
kind of <UNK> day - ish but not so close to christmas .
give the <UNK> a day off from school .
give them all the presents they can break .
"but during the christmas season , no advertising of sales is allowed ."
no sappy <UNK> by sally <UNK> that play on our <UNK> guilt to come and give a starving african child a sandwich .
"on december <#> , <#> , and <#> , all we do is celebrate each other and ourselves and any gods we may believe in ."
churches are closed except for <#> hours on december <#> .
"apart from that , it 's all got to come from within ."
"no sports , no american idol stars singing christmas <UNK> ."
just families staying in and playing games and talking and laughing and maybe even crying .
"yes , i know i 'm a cynical <UNK> ."
but it 'll still never happen because nearly <#> % of this nation 's economy is driven by <#> months in the winter . carefully <UNK> and scheduled .
sally <UNK> is waiting in her air - conditioned trailer in <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> and clay <UNK> are standing in fake snow on a set in california . and walmart is going to <UNK> yet another sale .
i think i 'll go up north and find some deep <UNK> woods and stand in the middle of them and listen to the silence .
"so i signed up for a new online "" game "" that 's been popping up all over , urllink nation states ."
it 's a website created by the writer of the book urllink jennifer government .
my nation is urllink the most <UNK> republic of <UNK> y <UNK> .
"visit it at your convenience ... if you create your own nation , you may <UNK> me to join my loose <UNK> ."
"after you pledge your <UNK> , of course . :)"
"most regular <UNK> of this journal know that i am , at heart , a person with an <UNK> love and passion for history ."
i ca n't get enough of the stuff .
but that 's just because it 's a gig that i can do to pay the bills .
what i want to do for a living is history stuff .
this is apparently <#> of the big <UNK> shows in the <UNK> .
sandy was going because she is on the <UNK> county <UNK> 's <UNK> patrol and had to log some time .
i went so i could go to the <UNK> campus .
i had stuff to do that was n't <UNK> .
i went to the urllink american cultural studies department to talk to the chairman and get some information but found out i 'd missed him by ten minutes .
the <UNK> date for applications is december <#> for the following school year so i 've missed out on admission for this coming september .
i 'm going to apply to the college and get a <UNK> and see what i can find .
<UNK> and i are going to start out by putting up papers we wrote in college and go from there .
maybe a little discussion forum down the road .
"anyway , that 's coming up real soon now ."
there wo n't be much to start with but we hope to advance <UNK> in the direction of our dream .

i was catching up on my dave barry columns today while installing ( for a second time )
this is urllink the column i was reading that <UNK> this entry .
"before you click on the column to read the genius that is the dave , click to this site : urllink <UNK> ."
"did you look at "" chair "" ?"
they want an amazing amount of money for chair .
so much that <#> could go out and by a decent used car with it .
"this is an example of "" found art "" which is to say , "" trash "" ."
"<#> person 's trash is another person 's treasure , they say . or"
do n't get me wrong ; i love art . a lot .
"i do n't really "" get "" some of the stuff by <UNK> or <UNK> but i appreciate it ."
"i think that the reason i appreciate their work , as well as the works of hundreds of others , is that they have created ."
they 've made something out of nothing and put effort into it .
<UNK> 's urllink <UNK> are a little out there but they have motion and contrast .
"on the other side of the coin are the works of mark <UNK> , who 's paintings are , at first glance , nearly <UNK> ."
"when you look more deeply into them though , you see subtle <UNK> of shade which make for a urllink complex image ."
i have a beautiful drawing of a <UNK> she did which hangs proudly on my wall .
"i look at it frequently , and appreciate it ."
heather also is a <UNK> -- a maker of candles -- who is dedicated to her craft .
"she takes great pains at making sure her candles ; indeed , everything she does , are made well and with care ."
i understand that not every piece of art is called ' art ' by all .
but the vast majority of people who create art do just that : they create .
they do n't make nothing out of nothing .
"i 'll close by sharing an idea i had a long time ago for a work of pseudo "" performance art "" ."
the can itself would be <UNK> from above with a narrow - focus white spot .
as people came into the room they would be invited to grab at random from <#> of several boxes around the room a piece of colored paper .
they would n't be able to determine the color before they took it .
then they would be invited to <UNK> the paper up or fold it or do whatever with it and toss it into the basket .
"there would be a distance involved between the <UNK> of the exhibit and the <UNK> area , so not every item would go into the basket ."
some would fall around the outside of it .
"from there , the basket would fill with <UNK> colored paper , always changing as it filled ."
"every so often , when it was <UNK> , an image would be taken by a <UNK> camera of the basket and the <UNK> field around it ."
then the basket would be <UNK> and the floor swept and the process would start again .
"sure , it 's wacky and odd but it is created art ."
"in fact , it 's created by hundreds of people ."
i got this link from a friend and thought i 'd share .
this guy is amazing with what he can do .
it is n't dirty or anything and still manages to be entertaining ! !
urllink <UNK> it 's about <#> minutes long .
"i was talking to a friend yesterday about the <UNK> of life -- insurance , relationships , work , kids and family , money , etc ."
we talked about how nice it would be to go back in time to be a kid again .
"<UNK> , i decided that <#> years old would be a nearly perfect time to go back ."
<#> days as an eleven year old boy in late june of <#> ; the year that i was eleven .
"that 's the other part of the requirement , to go back in time as well ."
to be able to identify with being an eleven year old better .
"for my friend <UNK> , it would have been <#> ."
"neither of us would have a clue how to live today if we suddenly became eleven , so it would be best to be in our own times ."
"so , there we were : <UNK> as an <#> year old girl in <#> and bob as an <#> year old boy in <#> ."
and there 's nothing to do but enjoy life as it was meant to be enjoyed .
no worries about money or families or the state of the world .
"at eleven years old you get upset that the news is on , since that means the cartoons are n't ."
you live for urllink the wonderful world of disney on sunday nights and you bug your parents to go see urllink star wars over and over .
"life , in <UNK> , was truly good , at least for me ."
they live in poverty and pain and i feel sadness and pity for them .
but this is my life and my <#> year old self does n't really know about them in any great depth .
"from there , i continued to <UNK> this desire to retreat ."
in this way the experience would be pure and genuine .
"or , i asked , would she like to go back and be a <#> year old in the body of an <#> year old ?"
where she would be able to look at her situation <UNK> and do the things she really wanted to do ?
"there 's no need to "" take chances "" ."
she can appreciate the events of the days first hand and mold her experience as she wanted to .
she would live the days as she pleased and when she came back she would have those memories intact .
she chose to look at the world through the genuine eyes of an <#> year old and take those experiences back with her .
that 's totally valid and a good choice .
"for me , it was n't really that easy of a choice ."
to <UNK> in that feeling of warmth and happiness and security .
my brother jim has been gone for <#> years now .
"for dad it 's been <#> years and mom , <#> ."
"that 's a long time to go and the memories , though still <UNK> , begin to fade slowly , like a <UNK> from the <UNK> century ."
the <UNK> have begun to even out and the shadows are lighter .
would it be valuable to go back and be able to really burn those images in my mind ?
or am i unable to separate the <#> year old me far enough away that i could perform this exercise for what it is ?
it was an odd and almost funny realization when it happened .
the visit on friday to <UNK> went very well .
"i met with the <UNK> director of the <UNK> program , urllink david <UNK> ."
he 's a very nice person and patiently answered all of my questions about the program .
<#> of the best things about the program is how wide - open it is .
"there 's only <#> required course in the entire track , urllink <UNK> <#> , and everything else is decided between you and your advisor . in a <UNK>"
", i have to start out at the master 's level , where i 'll get an ma in <UNK> ."
"from there , i 'll go on the the <UNK> ."
the <UNK> master is <#> tracks : <#> credit hours plus thesis or <#> credits without .
"the way i <UNK> , that would be the case ."
"also , the <#> credits route requires that some of the credits be in <UNK> designs involving management skills ."
even if they do n't accept the credits i took ( nearly <#> years ago now ) at urllink eastern i can still do hp .
program which is an additional <#> credits ( i think ... ) plus <UNK> .
"about <#> years , once i start the ball rolling ."
"he was also happy to hear i 've had experience teaching ( earth science , <UNK> , physics ) at the college level ."
i was walking on clouds the rest of the day .
it was also a really pretty day and the sun was out .
sandy had to keep hold of my <UNK> to keep me from floating off .
mai <UNK> and <UNK> seem to always win out .
i applied online to <UNK> via the urllink <UNK> education program and got my acceptance letter yesterday .
it 's really cool to have that to look forward to .
"of course , i ca n't take all of my classes this way ; that would be way too easy ."
but it 's still easy to take them this way for as long as i can .
now i have to decide when to apply to the school .
i could apply to the school now to get accepted for the <#> - <#> year but
i do n't know if that would be more or less <UNK> when i can take the classes through the <UNK> education program .
i should probably take the urllink <UNK> at the very least
if i tank the test i can always take it later or wait .
"since i can take several le classes and still apply them to the program requirements , there is n't as much pressure to get accepted ."
but it would be good to have them out of the way and be able to concentrate on school .
my net take - home pay is about $ <#> per year .
maybe a touch more but that 's close enough for my purposes .
i can get graduate level student <UNK> for up to $ <#> per year which are tax - free .
"hell , i could even get a <#> hour position here and keep my benefits and maybe end up making even more money than i do now ."
i know that this money would have to be <UNK> eventually
but it would enable me to get a <UNK> .
much faster than i would get <#> by taking night classes only .
"i 'd be able to take several classes per semester , rather than the <#> or <#> i 'd be able to take otherwise ."
according to urllink <UNK> the <UNK> salary for an assistant professor ( the lowest <UNK> - track position ) <UNK> is $ <#> .
"even the 25th <UNK> is still at $ <#> , still more than i make now as a middle - level systems administrator ."
"for urllink ann <UNK> specifically , the numbers are better : $ <#> and $ <#> for <UNK> and 25th <UNK> , <UNK> ."
"i 'm not making any rash decisions here , i 'm simply laying out ideas to be <UNK> upon ."
"if your mission in life is not already to preserve the english tongue , it should be ."
brought to you by urllink quizilla i take pride in my ability to communicate .
"when you meet me face - to - face , that 's when all <UNK> are off ."
"<UNK> , as usual , from urllink eric ."
i do n't have enough friends who take these tests so i have to rely on eric to find them for me .
"when you 're not <UNK> your solar batteries , you 're writing <UNK> and wishing nasa would call ."
"over in livejournal , they have these <UNK> <UNK> and little quizzes ."
here 's <#> i <UNK> from urllink eric : what would your anime life be like ?
by urllink <UNK> name : gender : your looks : <UNK> eyes and a <UNK> your best friend : a <UNK> sweet <UNK> your powers : energy <UNK> .

"he <UNK> me with ken 's email address , which was way cool"
so i popped ken an email this morning .
i told him how much i missed his show and i was looking forward to his getting back on the air as soon as possible .
"he said he 's been <UNK> at various places , so that 's a good thing ."
he 's also quite intelligent and very funny .
these are obviously things which do n't <UNK> well with today 's <UNK> radio stations who import everything from somewhere else .
"if you ever want ken 's email address , email me and i 'll let you know ."
"i think it 's ok to give out , since he was giving it out on his last days on the air there ."
but i do n't want to put it here for worries that the <UNK> will <UNK> it and start <UNK> his email with <UNK> for v <UNK> g r <UNK>
i also was informed that i have to <UNK> a time tracking and urllink trouble <UNK> system here at work .
i understand why but i do n't necessarily have to like it and the reasons behind it .
damn blogspot does n't have any way to make a post ' friends - only ' .
it has n't been as detailed as i 'd hoped for but it 's been very interesting . to run down
it really <UNK> my appetite for future things to come .
"the second week was , <UNK> put , a bust ."
the <UNK> was <#> - <UNK> and boring and i found it difficult to even follow the lecture .
"she sounded like -- indeed , was -- she was reading from a printed sheet ."
"this week 's class , the third , on death in new orleans , was quite interesting ."
i decided that i 'll wait to write about it until the classes end .
"i had hoped to <UNK> each class , assuming that they were all going to be as information - heavy as the first <#> ."
this was n't the case but that 's an ok thing .
i 'll probably draw primarily from the first class when i write but touch on things learned from the other <#> .
"the first class is what got the ball rolling , anyway ."
"<UNK> <UNK> , will be replaced as part of a command <UNK> that has been in the works for several months , administration officials said tuesday ."
<UNK> : command <UNK> are rare and well - announced .
"the higher you go , the <UNK> they are ."
and they 're always held with a lot of <UNK> because there are issues that have to be addressed down the command chain .
"when a general is relieved from command to go to a different post , there 's always prior notice as to where he or she will be posted to :"
"we wish him well at his new posting . """
"i could find no information about general <UNK> ' new posting , nor an announcement of his leaving ."
"there was some <UNK> in the past several weeks , since the news stories broke , but nothing about a command <UNK> ."
at least they actually did say they were <UNK> general <UNK> from her command .
"ultimately , it <UNK> down to this : general <UNK> 's career is over ."
"she has a big giant neon black check mark next to her name which will ensure that she 's passed over for promotion and future "" <UNK> "" commands ."
i would like to thank the wonderful shawn <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> .
there 's a link to his blog on the left . without his tech <UNK>
"( that 's ' many blessings , friend ' , to those who do n't know <UNK> ... )"
<UNK> to the radio this morning as they discussed the killing of <UNK> taylor and the social issues that create children who do n't care about anything .
the talk swung around to the attitude of children today and the issue of punishment .
"as usual as far as the media is concerned there are only <#> sides , those who advocate physical <UNK> and those who are against this ."
i find it slightly amusing that the do - <UNK> never seem to actually give details of these ' other ways ' .
and i have found that the attitudes of the boys i 've worked with has changed over the years .
when i started boys were eager to get on with whatever activity was going on .
they were respectful to their elders and <UNK> instruction without any problem .
"now , they do n't want to do anything , are <UNK> and only do what is asked of them under severe protest ."
"this is not all boys , but a vast majority ."
"the attitude is not helped by parents who in the past attended events , provided transport and generally encouraged their <UNK> ."
"now some , not all , are <UNK> , they give no encouragement , we never see them ."
there is a distinct lack of commitment from the <UNK> that is <UNK> by the ' he did n't want to ' attitude of parents .
' you ca n't make me ' gives every boy a <UNK> weapon to <UNK> whenever and whatever he wants .
the media showed there are more than <#> sides to this discussion . and
the <UNK> to physical punishment should be discussed not <UNK> at
the crowd round a <UNK> desk was n't for some problem he was having with work .
they were all playing ' who want 's to be a <UNK> ' .
unfortunately they seemed to stall long before reaching the magic <#> .
i 'm currently <UNK> to read a <UNK> for changes to the software project i manage .
"the idea of writing about everyday life somehow seems <UNK> , after all who would want to read about my life ."
"surely the count could have been done a lot sooner , <UNK> those votes that were not valid ."
he is also reported as ' unable to move ' but he seems to have quite a bit of freedom .
nice to see that blogger is back up to speed .
i was contemplating having to write something to generate my pages .
the weekly archive is still causing me problems though .
i 've switched to monthly and it seems ok .
number of days posts on the main screen has problems

<#> nights in a hotel room with the kids .
played hockey on the olympic - sized <UNK> at <UNK> ice gardens last night until about <UNK> this morning .
that 's a big ice sheet -- the same <#> the <#> olympic team practiced on .
"it was cool , especially with the storm outside lighting up the sky ."
i 'm going to play every wednesday night with these guys .
am i supposed to be worried about the latest terrorism threat ?
"they issue it , but they do nothing to the threat level ( that <UNK> color code system ) ."
what the hell is going on up at the ol ' white house ?
<UNK> better start sleeping soon or both ang and i are going to <UNK> .
<UNK> still is not sleeping through the night ... not even close .
i 'm not getting up with him but the screaming is a pain in the ass .
"rain , rain , rain ... playing open hockey this morning and then poker with the kid , <UNK> and scott this afternoon ."
"after almost no sleep , i 'll be hitting the sack early ."
it 's time to <UNK> and get ready for the weekend .
so i do n't really have a whole lot planned yet .
"if it <UNK> a lot this weekend , then maybe it 's an <UNK> time to get some skiing in !"
some <UNK> i have been looking at : urllink women 's <UNK> guide jacket and urllink men 's flight jacket
i know . <#> 's a woman 's jacket and the other is a men 's .
i find that sometimes the men 's <UNK> fit better on me .
"i think it 's because my shoulders are a bit <UNK> , so a <UNK> cut is <UNK> ."
"apparently on sunday , there will be a tree lighting event in my neighborhood ."
i guess they 've decided to put up a big tree in the new market square .
"it 's it 's not too bad out on sunday , i might go check it out ."
maybe go ski around the golf course ( conditions <UNK> ) before the tree lighting .
"holiday stuff i do n't know about you , but i have not really done much in the way of christmas shopping yet ."
i really do n't know what to get anyway .
at least my brother and i have agreed not to get each other anything this year .
since i wo n't be able to visit my folks this holiday season i 'm not <UNK> to get them anything .
but i 'm sure i 'll make up for it at a later date ( like at chinese new year or something ) .
"we will , however , be visiting my boyfriend 's parents for a few days ."
but at least there we have agreed on a certain budget .
this way no <#> will be breaking the bank .
it 's relatively sunny right now with a few clouds .
anyway .... today was the day of the big parade for the montreal <UNK> .
"i 'm not much of a football fan , but i still think it 's great that they won the grey cup ."
i believe that the last time they won the grey cup was back in <#> .
"so , as the parade was set for <UNK> , i figure i 'd check it out via <#> of the <UNK> found at urllink montreal cam . and"
lo and behold there was that sea of people waiting along <UNK> street .
"eventually around <UNK> , the <UNK> with the players came by ."
right behind the last vehicle was a sea of people following them to the end of the parade ( <UNK> and <UNK> college ) .
"afterwards , i decided to check in on the <UNK> at the <UNK> ."
i think i might be coming down with something .
i 've had a bit of a headache since last night and it does n't seem to want to go away .
"also , right after lunch i wanted to sleep so badly ."
and i really do hope i am not coming down with a cold !
:-p they 're <UNK> some snow for this weekend and it would be crappy if i got sick and go out and play in the snow .
:-p maybe i 'll just get some more tea and settle in for the night when i get home ...
"today 's rant if you drive , then this is a rant for you !"
have you ever noticed that the more expensive the vehicle the bigger the jerk that 's behind the wheel ?
is it because they can afford such a car that it gives them the license to drive however they want ?
"so , in order to do so he <UNK> up and passed a school bus just as it was about to stop for a pick up . and"
"now , do n't get me wrong here ."
i do n't want to say that all luxury car drivers are jerks .
it 's just that so far the ones that i have seen tend to be the more obnoxious drivers .
"i wo n't say that i 'm a perfect driver , but i certainly wo n't drive in a way that might <UNK> others !"
in other news there 's not a whole lot else to comment at this point .
"i could get onto the subject of the problems in the middle east , but then that would lead into a discussion on politics and religion ."
"and , well , i 'm just not in the mood for that right now ."
it 's a bit heavy for <UNK> night .
shopping i read an article in today 's <UNK> about the christmas shopping season .
it made note of the largest mall in the region ( <UNK> <UNK> ) .
it talked about the <UNK> and the <UNK> .
it discussed how crazy some <UNK> are when it came to finding parking spaces and shopping within the mall in general .
i 've been to <UNK> <UNK> before they recently <UNK> . and
"even before they <UNK> , i found it to be a very busy and crowded place ."
it 's a bit too busy and crowded for my tastes .
"i think that this season , whatever shopping i need to do for this christmas i will try to get done either downtown or on - line ! :)"
"i 've gone down there about <#> times this year , i think they can handle not seeing me this xmas ."
"on the other hand , it looks like i will be heading in the other direction and visiting the folks of my significant other ."
"i do n't think we plan on making it a very expensive xmas , so shopping should n't be that difficult ."
new year 's <UNK> received some propaganda in the mail today for the development i live in .
it 's just a small collection of flyers put together by the development .
<#> is a letter wishing us all a happy holiday season .
there 's also mention of a skating <UNK> near the <UNK> .
"also , there is supposed to be an official lighting of the christmas tree at the <UNK> this coming sunday ."
"$ <#> per person will get you an open bar , dinner and champagne to ring in the new year ."
i think that 's a bit steep for me .
<UNK> <UNK> let 's try another font for a change .
i need to exercise a bit of creativity here instead of just settling for <UNK> .
:) i came across an interesting weblog of an american currently living in japan .
i found it while doing a urllink google search on this lovely japanese breakfast food called urllink <UNK> .
there 's also some non - japanese related <UNK> at this site .
anyone want to buy a urllink <UNK> ?
good stuff is hard to come by these days !
:d other <UNK> it seems that as we grow older time seems to be going by that much faster .
"( <UNK> question ) ya know.. since i am writing this blog on the cheap , i have no idea how many people have visited my blog ."
"therefore , it would be nice to know who ( if there is a who ) out there has viewed this ."
"or , if you really want , you can say hi or something ."
